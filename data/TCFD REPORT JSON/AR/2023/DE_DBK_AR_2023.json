        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Letter from the Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, we look back on another year spent in a very challenging environment. In addition to the war in Ukraine, which is being waged with undiminished ferocity, a new war broke out between Israel and Hamas, which threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East and is also causing new economic disruptions.\n\nThe resulting complex economic situation is one that confronts our clients with difficult choices. In a world where the balance of power is shifting and protectionism is on the rise, they need to position themselves correctly. They need to make urgent investments in the future at a time when interest rates and, consequently, financing costs have risen significantly. And they need to hedge against heightening risks.\n\nAs a Global Hausbank , it is our task to support our clients at this time, shoulder to shoulder. Together, we want to find the right solutions and set the course for their successful future. With our strategic reorganisation in 2019 and the subsequent transformation, we are ideally positioned to deliver on this in the best possible way.\n\nThe results for the past year are further proof that this strategy is working. As our clients are doing more business with us, our revenues have increased by 6% to almost \u20ac 29 billion. At the same time, we remained disciplined in our spending, with adjusted costs growing at 3%, which was slower than inflation. Thanks to this operational strength, we were able to increase our pre-tax profit once again. At \u20ac 5.7 billion, it was 2% higher than the previous year's figure, the highest level in 16 years.\n\nThe rating agency S&P Global recognised our renewed progress in December with a further rating upgrade. This should also have a positive impact on our future earnings.\n\nWe want you to benefit from this success as well. We will propose a dividend of \u20ac 0.45 per share for the financial year 2023 to the Annual General Meeting in May 2024. As in the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of 50%. In addition, we will buy back treasury shares worth \u20ac 675 million in the first half of the year, after having already invested \u20ac 450 million in share buybacks in 2023.\n\n## Demonstrating resilience in an uncertain environment\n\n2023 was also a very successful year for us because we underpinned Deutsche Bank's stability and resilience when they were put to the test. In March, following bankruptcies at a number of regional banks in the United States and the takeover of Credit Suisse, our bank also came under pressure for a short time. But we withstood this pressure and quickly made it clear that there can be no doubt about our solidity.\n\nThe full figures for the year are proof that these tumultuous days left no lasting marks. At the end of 2023, our deposits at \u20ac 622 billion were back above the level at the end of 2022, after having fallen slightly during the market turbulences.\n\nWe experienced equally little disruption to our business as a result of the difficult economic environment of the past year. Our risk managers have once again lived up to their first-class reputation. Building on our high-quality and well-diversified loan book, we were able to limit loan losses and loan loss provisions. The latter was \u20ac 1.5 billion, or 31 basis points of average loans. This was only slightly above the forecast announced at the beginning of the year.\n\nOur capital base is also extremely robust: the common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of the year, compared to 13.4% at the end of 2022. This was significantly higher than our target of around 13% for the period up to 2025. We owe this on the one hand to our continued capital discipline, which is reflected in the renewed reduction of risk-weighted assets; on the other, we are now operating so profitably that we are creating additional capital despite rising dividends.",

        "page_content": "## Stable earnings mix shows strength of business model\n\nWe owe this operational strength to all of our business divisions. As part of our strategic reorganization, we set ourselves the goal of aligning our bank around four strong pillars that complement each other and give us stability in different market phases.\n\nOur revenue mix last year shows how far we have come in this area, with almost four-fifths of our revenues coming from businesses that provide reliable returns. And these were very well distributed across all four divisions. Of course, our Corporate Bank and Private Bank in particular benefited from higher global interest rates. However, the bank's strong full-year figures would not have been possible if the Investment Bank and our Asset Management had not also made a lot out of a difficult market environment.\n\nSpecifically, our divisions have developed as follows:\n\nThe Corporate Bank increased its revenues by 22%, up to \u20ac 7.7 billion. All businesses achieved double-digit growth. In addition to net interest income, we also owe this to product innovations and investments in customer service in core markets and growth areas.\n\nAt \u20ac 9.2 billion, revenues in the Investment Bank were 9% lower than in the very strong previous year. Significant revenue growth in the Origination & Advisory business did not offset the declines in the Fixed Income & Currency business. By the end of the year, however, there were already clear signs of recovery, with the Investment Bank's revenues increasing by 10% year on year in the final quarter.\n\nThe Private Bank generated revenues of \u20ac 9.6 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the previous year. This growth would have been twice as strong if adjusted for one-off effects such as the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy. The largest increases were recorded in the deposits business, particularly in the Private Bank Germany, which also accounted for a significant part of the high net inflows of \u20ac 29 billion. However, the positive result here was clouded by what were, in part, considerable delays and restrictions for some clients following the migration of Postbank's IT environment to a common platform. Here, we failed to meet our clients' expectations. In recent months, we have significantly reduced the backlog, for instance with the help of additional staff. At the same time, we have revised and partially automated various processes to prevent something similar from happening in the future.\n\nIn our Asset Management business, revenues declined by 9% to \u20ac 2.4 billion. This was mainly due to reduced management fees as a result of market value losses and slightly lower margins. At the same time, assets under management grew by \u20ac 75 billion, including \u20ac 28 billion in net inflows. This creates the basis for future fee income.\n\n## Increased investments lay the foundation for future success\n\nAs a result, we have established a strong market position in all four business divisions. And we see potential to expand it further. That is why we made more investments in 2023 to accelerate our growth trajectory and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nTo this end, we have driven product innovations and hired personnel in some key areas to improve our market coverage, especially in areas where we can score points with clients with our high-quality expertise and advice. This includes our Wealth Management business, Client Coverage in the Corporate Bank and Origination & Advisory in the Investment Bank. We have decisively strengthened the latter with the acquisition of the leading British corporate broker Numis.\n\nAt the same time, we have continued to invest in technology, stringent processes and platforms, and our controls. In recent years, we have focused our investments here in order to meet the regulatory requirements and to effectively protect the bank. After investing more than \u20ac 1 billion again in improvements to our controls in 2023, we now assume that the remediation work on our most important regulatory programmes is now nearing completion.\n\nIn terms of costs, we are also at a turning point. In 2023, we deliberately put some major cost items behind us. In addition to investments in business, technology and controls, this included restructuring and severance costs related to the transformation strategy and extraordinary items such as amortization of goodwill at Numis. A large part of these costs will not repeat from 2024, which is why noninterest expenses should have reached their peak last year at \u20ac 21.7 billion.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook: on track to hit return target, with greater ambition for revenues\n\nFor the coming years, we expect a clear decline in costs. On the one hand, investments in technology, processes and controls will increasingly translate into savings; on the other, savings from efficiency measures will reduce our cost base. In 2023, we further optimized our branch network. In addition, we launched a program to cut around 3,500 jobs by means of automation and the elimination of duplicate functions, especially for non-client-facing roles.\n\nOur goal is to arrive at a cost level that means the bank is protected against external influences in an uncertain environment. We see this level at around \u20ac 20 billion per year, and we want to reach it in 2025. Cost discipline is a top priority, and it is a prerequisite for us to achieve our goals. By the end of 2025, we aim to achieve a cost/income ratio of below 62.5% and a posttax return on tangible equity at above 10%. And we have a clear path towards these goals.\n\nAnother important factor in this is our improved revenues outlook. Our original target was to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 3.5 to 4.5% for the years 2021 to 2025. In recent years, averaging around 7%, we have far exceeded this target and we are confident that we will continue to grow at a stronger pace. We have therefore raised our target for 2021 to 2025 to compound annual revenue growth of 5.5 to 6.5%. By the end of 2025, this would translate to annual revenues of around \u20ac 32 billion.\n\nIn  line  with  our  ambitious  financial  targets,  we  expect  to  be  able  to  further  increase  capital  distributions  to  you,  our shareholders, in the coming years. We have set ourselves a capital distribution goal of 8 billion euros in respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025, paid in 2022 to 2026, and we believe we are in a good position to exceed this objective based on the achievement of our financial targets. For the 2025 financial year, we are aiming for a dividend of \u20ac 1.00 per share, subject to it being consistent with a 50% payout ratio.\n\nThat said, we are aware that the economic environment will remain difficult for the time being. With our diversified business model, however, we believe we are well positioned for further growth, even in a challenging environment. At the core of our strategy as a Global Hausbank is our ambition to accompany our clients at all stages, as a strong partner, who gives them financial  security  and  works with  them to  achieve  their  long-term  success. Our clients' response to this and the growing demand for our products and services reinforce our belief that we are on the right track with this strategy. This gives us the strength and confidence to focus our plans on Deutsche Bank's future. We have a clear ambition: to continue our growth trajectory and be a leading European bank.\n\nKnowing that you are at our side is both a pleasure and an incentive for us.\n\nThank you for placing your trust in Deutsche Bank.\n\nKind regards,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristian Sewing",

Thanks to its prudent risk management, the bank has a strong and stable balance sheet and has further strengthened its capital base. As a result, we are this year once again in a position to substantially increase capital distributions to shareholders and we are pleased that the Supervisory Board and Management Board will propose to you a 50% increase in the dividend to \u20ac 0.45 per share at this year's Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn this economic environment, the resilience and sustainable profitability of our bank were also focus topics for the Supervisory Board. It  was  the  Risk  Committee's  task  to  keep  an  eye  on  our  capital  adequacy  as  well  as  to  oversee  the  bank's  risk management  and  the  development  of  non-financial  risks.  Another  priority  was  to  set  the  course  for  future  growth.  The Supervisory Board closely monitored the strategic development of the bank's culture and business model together with its financial targets and capital objectives up to 2025. The Supervisory Board expressly supports the bank's even sharper focus on its role as a Global Hausbank. Part of this is supporting clients in their sustainable and digital transformation. This strategy not only enables the bank to play its role within the German and European economy but also - of this the Supervisory Board is  convinced - it is the right way to generate sustainable profits and returns for you as shareholders. In this context, the Supervisory Board welcomes and supports the Management Board's work on clearly defining the bank's purpose, its vision and aspirational culture, guided by the conviction that our top priority must be an even stronger focus on placing our clients at the center of everything we do.\n\nEffective controls protect both our bank and our clients. Further improving these controls was another important topic last year. The Supervisory Board regularly discussed significant regulatory issues as well as progress in the processing of material litigation cases. We are aware that there is still more to do. The Management Board and Supervisory Board are in close dialogue with regulators and are focused on delivering the necessary improvements. To achieve this, the bank spent about \u20ac 1.2 billion on controls in 2023 and hired around 1,000 dedicated professionals across all regions. More details on these important issues can be found in Deutsche Bank's Non-Financial Report, which is published in parallel with this Annual Report.\n\nOne of the issues that the Supervisory Board addressed intensively last year was the restrictions for our clients following the migration of Postbank's IT to a common platform. The Management Board regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on the progress made in resolving the backlogs that had arisen, which were able to be reduced substantially over the past months. Nevertheless, it is clear that we have not lived up to our service and quality standards here and have disappointed our clients. On behalf of the Supervisory Board I would like to express my sincere apologies for the delays and problems caused to our clients. The Supervisory Board has taken action as a result and reduced the variable compensation of several current and departed Management Board members. Details can be found in our Compensation Report.\n\nThere you will also find information on how we intend to develop the Management Board compensation system for 2024 and beyond. In our review, we incorporated feedback from investors and are addressing two main concerns: first, we want to simplify the system, making it more transparent for our external stakeholders, by significantly reducing the number of targets and indicators on which variable compensation depends. Second, we aim to align how we evaluate Management Board members' performance even more closely with the interests of our shareholders. This applies above all to the long-term component of variable compensation, which in future will no longer be measured against past years' results. In the new system, both financial and ESG targets will be forward-looking over a period of three years. In addition, we aim to be more ambitious when it comes to setting targets for certain key performance indicators. We will submit the revised compensation system to you for voting at the Annual General Meeting in May; it is to be applied as early as this year.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Supervisory  Board  also  addressed  personnel  decisions  in  the  Management  Board.  At  the  Annual  General Meeting, we bid farewell to Christiana Riley, Americas CEO, and Karl von Rohr, President and Head of Private Bank, who left the bank at the end of October after 25 years of service. Claudio de Sanctis subsequently assumed responsibility for the Private Bank and joined the Management Board in July. He has been with Deutsche Bank since 2018 and has successfully transformed the International Private Bank in recent years and focused it on its strengths in the advisory business. Stefan Simon assumed responsibility for the Americas region - in addition to his global responsibility for Legal, Regulatory Affairs and  Anti-Financial  Crime.  Besides  client  coverage,  the  structure  of  the  US  market  requires  significant  coordination  and dialogue  with  regulators.  Responsible  for  maintaining  closer  connections  between  the  regions  and  our  home  market  is Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen. He assumed responsibility for Germany and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in July. He also continues to oversee the Asia-Pacific region. Rebecca Short was given an extended mandate on the Management Board with a view to making the bank more efficient. In addition to her responsibility for Human Resources, she was appointed Chief Operating Officer with overall responsibility for the Group's costs.",

        "page_content": "As part of personnel reorganization measures, the Management Board was reduced from ten to nine members to make it more efficient. With this new composition, we do, however, fall short of our own commitment regarding the share of women on the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is focused on raising the proportion of women in leadership roles, both at Management Board level and below. As part of the bank's new compensation system, we seek to integrate the latter more firmly into the performance goals of our Management Board members.\n\nOn the Supervisory Board, there was a routine change as a result of last year's elections, with Susanne Bleidt, Claudia Fieber, Brigit  Laumen,  Gerlinde  Siebert,  Frank  Schulze,  Stephan  Szukalski  and  J\u00fcrgen  T\u00f6gel  being  newly  elected as  employee representatives, while Jan Duscheck, Manja Eifert and Timo Heider were re-elected for a further term of office. In January 2024, Birgit Laumen resigned from her mandate and the court subsequently appointed Florian Haggenmiller as her successor. I would like to once again welcome all those who joined the Supervisory Board. My special thanks go to Frank Schulze, one of my deputies, for the close cooperation and partnership since the very beginning.\n\nOn the shareholder side, continuity was the order of the day. Four shareholder representatives, whose term of office expired in  2023, were each re-elected by the Annual General Meeting for another four years. We look forward to continuing our valuable collaboration with Mayree Clark, John Thain, Michele Trogni and Norbert Winkeljohann.\n\nIn 2024, our Annual General Meeting will again be held virtually. The experience of the past few years has convinced us to take this step; this inclusive format offers numerous benefits. We have received recognition for the transparent implementation and quality of the answers to shareholder questions, which will again be submitted in advance this year. At the same time, we aim to enable an enhanced dialogue with shareholders on the day of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nDear shareholders, the Supervisory Board is confident that your Deutsche Bank is on the right track. The bank has the right set-up and a strong management team. We will do everything we can to support them in the next phase of their growth strategy and to put our clients at the heart of everything we do. I am convinced that if we focus on our clients and our strengths, we will continue to create sustainable value for you, our shareholders.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlex Wynaendts\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board performed all the tasks assigned to it by law and regulatory requirements as well as those pursuant to the Articles of Association and Terms of Reference.\n\nThe Management Board informed us regularly, without delay and comprehensively of all matters with relevance for our bank, and in particular on business policies and strategy, in addition to fundamental issues relating to the company's management and  culture,  corporate  planning  and  control,  compliance  and  compensation  systems.  It  reported  to  us  on  the  financial development, earnings and risk situation, the bank's liquidity, capital and risk management, the technical and organizational resources as well as business transactions and events that were of significant importance to the bank. We were involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. As in previous years, the Management Board provided us, in accordance with our requests, with enhanced reporting on several topic areas, for example: The combating of financial crime and the ongoing development of the related controls, the progress in remediating regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings, as well as important interactions with various regulators.\n\nIn  addition  to  regulatory  issues,  the  Supervisory  Board  extensively  addressed  the  situation  in  the  Private  Bank  and  the limitations for our clients following the migration of Postbank's IT to one shared platform. The Management Board regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on the progress made in resolving the resulting backlogs, and these have been substantially reduced over the past months.\n\nPromoting diversity on the Management Board of Deutsche Bank is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it will be intensively addressing the topic in the future, too. The Supervisory Board plenum and Nomination Committee deliberated several times on the status and measures in this context and discussed them together with the Management Board. For the selection of suitable members for the Management Board, the Nomination Committee takes into account the balance and diversity  of  the  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  of  all  the  Management Board members. It also actively seeks to foster diversity on the Management Board, for example, with regard to gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds and mindsets. A special focus has been placed in this context on raising the proportion of women in leadership roles, both on the Management Board and at the levels below.\n\nIn several meetings, we discussed together with the Management Board the actual and aspired state of the corporate culture, the  progress  made  as  well  as  the  actions  to  achieve  the  related  objectives.  The  discussion  focused  on  the  values  and behaviors we would like to promote together in the bank overall. The Management Board established a program clearly defining the bank's purpose, its vision and aspirational culture to further develop the bank's corporate culture that will be launched in 2024.\n\nThe Supervisory Board Chairman and the committee chairs regularly had discussions with the Management Board between the meetings. They also consulted each other on the meeting agendas for the respective committees they chair and discussed topics  of  overarching  importance  for  the  Supervisory  Board.  Furthermore,  upcoming  decisions  were  deliberated  on  and prepared in discussions conducted regularly between the Management Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board as well  as  the  chairs  of  the  Supervisory  Board  committees.  In  addition,  the  Management  Board invited  us  to  a  total  of  four information events on various current topics. Characteristic for our cooperation with the Management Board was our focus on working together responsibly in a spirit of mutual trust for the successful further development of the company.\n\nThere were a total of 55 meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. These were conducted as meetings with physical attendance, video conferences or as hybrid meetings (with both on-site and virtual participation). When meetings were convened as video conferences, a room was also available for all members to participate on the bank's premises. Between the meetings, resolutions were adopted, when necessary, through circulation voting procedure.",

Two meetings were conducted with physical attendance and six as hybrid meetings.\n\nAgain over the past year, we focused in particular on geopolitical and economic developments and their effects on the bank. We discussed developments in the banking sector both in Europe and in the USA. At several meetings, we had in-depth discussions with the Management Board about the status of processing in the Private Bank. We focused in several meetings on the effective implementation and further development of the bank's strategy and corporate culture. Together with the Management Board, we deliberated on these reports and on the regular progress reports on the individual business divisions, infrastructure areas and regions. Also, we regularly discussed regulatory issues and proceedings that affect our bank around the world, significant litigation cases and the progress made in the remediation of findings. Furthermore, we addressed the appointments  of  members  to  the  committees  as  well  as  the  corresponding  committee  tasks,  and  adopted  the  relevant resolutions in this context.\n\nAt our first meeting on February 1, we addressed the actual financial results and the planned key figures for the year 2022 as well as analysts' estimates. Deviations were discussed in detail. We confirmed the Management Board's preliminary proposal for the dividend, while also taking into account the regulatory requirements for capital funding, and we addressed the planning for 2023-2025, the investment portfolio 2023, as well as the development of business and management measures with regard to the ongoing investigations at DWS. The Management Board reported to us on the status of the consolidation of the IT platforms of Postbank and Deutsche Bank and the related challenges in this. We noted the draft of the Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Com\u00acmercial Code (HGB) with approval. While taking into account recommendations of the Compensation Control Committee and following consultations with the bank's Compensation Officer and independent external compensation consultants, we determined the level of the variable compensation for the Management Board members for the 2022 financial year. In this context, we also discussed the respective Management Board members'  achievement  levels  for  2022  and  the  plan  rules  for  the  year  2023,  and  we  set  long-term  objectives  for  the Management Board along with the relevant measurement criteria for the 2023 performance period. Furthermore, we discussed the annual assessment of the structure, size, composition and performance of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG).\n\nAt our second meeting on March 16, after the Management Board's reporting and a discussion with the auditor, and based on the  Audit  Committee's  recommendation,  we  approved  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Annual  Financial Statements  for  2022  and  agreed  to  the  Management  Board's  proposal  for  the  appropriation  of  distributable  profit.  We addressed the financial accounting system, the system of internal controls and the risk management system and discussed the  assessments  of  the  Management  Board  and  auditor  of  their  appropriateness  and  effectiveness.  Based  on  the  Audit Committee's recommendation, we determined that there are no objections to be raised regarding the Group's separate NonFinancial Report in accordance with Section 315c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB as well as the European Union's (EU) Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted in this context, also based on the final results of our own inspections. The Management Board reported to us on market developments and developments in the banking sector both in Europe and in the USA, the ongoing investigations at DWS, as well as the status of remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings. The Management Board presented a report to us on the structure of the compensation systems and the Human Resources Report for 2022. We also discussed and approved the Report of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we addressed the topics for the General Meeting and approved the proposals for the agenda. At the proposal of the Compensation Control Committee, we discussed the proposal to adjust the  structure  of  Supervisory  Board  compensation  and  a  corresponding  resolution  proposal  for  the  General  Meeting. Furthermore, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board adopted the resolutions necessary to exercise the shareholder rights in subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft in accordance with Section 32 of the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). We noted the report of the Management Board on changes in the regional advisory councils in Germany in accordance with Section 8 of the Articles of Association.\n\nAt our extraordinary meeting on April 26, we addressed Ms. Riley's departure from the bank as of May 31, 2023, and Mr. von Rohr's  as  of  October  31,  2023.  We  deliberated  on  the  joint  proposal  of  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Chairman's Committee that Mr. Claudio de Sanctis be appointed to the Management Board as the successor to Mr. von Rohr and resolved to approve this. We addressed the size of the Management Board, which was reduced from ten to nine members once the changes at the Management Board level became effective. Furthermore, we approved the proposals for adjustments to the Management Board members' areas of functional responsibility. The Management Board gave us an overview of the results for the first quarter of 2023 and an update on strategy.",

Subsequently, we discussed these topics with the Joint Supervisory Team and the timeframe for their implementation, and the corporate culture. We also addressed the pending General Meeting and adopted the resolution on the Chair of the General Meeting. The Management Board reported to us on, among other things, market developments and volatility in the market following the developments in connection with Silicon Valley Bank and the effects on the bank, the ongoing investigations at DWS as well as the development and status of the remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings.\n\nAt our constitutive meeting on May 17 directly after the General Meeting, we elected Mr. Alexander Wynaendts as Chairman of the Supervisory Board until the expiry of his mandate, Mr. Frank Schulze as first Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann as second Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we resolved to approve appointments of members to our committees following the personnel changes on the Supervisory Board and the publication of our updated Matrix of Skills. We resolved to issue the audit mandate to EY, who had been elected by the General Meeting as the auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt our meeting on July 27, we addressed Management Board compensation and carried out the necessary adjustments of the objectives based on a recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee in light of the changed areas of responsibility at the Management Board level. The Management Board reported to us on the reactions of the market and our stakeholders to the publication of the Interim Report and on the measures launched by the Management Board to accelerate the growth trajectory with regard to the targets by the year 2025. The Management Board reported to us on the current developments at DWS, the development of its business, its governance and the measures taken by its management relating to the ongoing investigations. We discussed together with the Management Board the business and IT activities in Russia and the timeline for the orderly downsizing of the business. Furthermore, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board adopted the resolutions necessary to exercise the shareholder rights in subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft in accordance with Section 32 of the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). Together with the Management Board, we discussed the corporate culture, regulators' expectations and the program sponsored by the Management Board for the further development of the corporate culture.\n\nWithin the framework of our meeting on October 25 and 26, we resolved to approve the Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Together with the Management Board, we extensively deliberated on Group strategy and the business strategies of the business divisions as well as the corporate culture and the definition of the bank's purpose and its vision. The Management Board reported to us on the operating business model, including the impacts on costs, and the bank's technology strategy aligned to the business strategy. We also addressed the status of the consolidation of the IT platforms of Postbank and Deutsche Bank and the process of working through the resulting delays and limitations for clients.\n\nAt our meeting on December 14, representatives of the Joint Supervisory Team presented the results of the Supervisory Review  and  Evaluation  Process  (SREP  2023)  along  with  related  regulatory  proposals  and  recommendations,  which  we subsequently discussed together. The Management Board reported to us on the development of business and the strategic priorities for the year 2024 as well as on the progress in remediating the portfolio of open regulatory enforcement measures and critical external findings in 2023. Together with the Management Board, we discussed the corporate culture against the backdrop of the bank's purpose and vision as well as the implementation measures planned in this context for the year 2024.

Seven ordinary meetings took place and two extraordinary meetings (including one together with the Nomination Committee). The Chairman's Committee addressed Management Board and Supervisory Board matters in depth, in  addition  to  corporate  governance  and  ongoing  topics  between  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board  as  well  as  the preparations for them. This included addressing the preparations for changes on the Management Board in consultation with the Nomination Committee, the preparation of the revised versions of our terms of reference and Supervisory Board-internal documents as well as topics in preparation for the General Meeting. The Committee also addressed the topic of the businessrelated use and monitoring of electronic communications, the state of services within the Private Bank and a series of special topics. Furthermore, the Committee addressed the mandates of the Management Board members and the assumption of costs for (former) members of the Management Board.\n\nIn 2023, the Risk Committee met six times - two meetings with physical attendance and four as video conferences. As in previous years, the Risk Committee focused on periodically recurring topics such as the annual appetite statement of the company, the internal process to ensure capital adequacy and the internal process to ensure an appropriate liquidity position. A key focus of the Committee at several meetings last year was on the topic of Non-Financial Risk in general, but also in particular with regard to specific risk types. As a regular item, the business division-specific risk appetites were assessed, in particular those of the Private Bank and DWS. In addition, the Committee obtained reports on significant political and economic developments  such  as  the  Israel-Gaza  conflict,  tensions  between  China  and  Taiwan  as  well  as  developments  in  the commercial real estate sector. Furthermore, the Committee addressed the bank's core transformation initiatives relating to the Risk  function.  With  regard  to  the  regulators'  priorities,  the  Committee  focused,  for  example,  on  the  bank-internal  risk management in general, the framework for recognizing provisions, non-financial risks and the topic of sustainability. Finally, the  Committee addressed the general framework with regard to product structure, the capital planning for  the  individual business divisions and changes in the credit models and the respective effects on the bank's capital.\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times in 2023. Five meetings were conducted with attendance on-site and four were held as video conferences. The areas of focus included addressing the impacts of the developments in the banking sector both in Europe  and  in  the  USA  for  the  bank's  accounting  statements  and  the  new  requirements  for  Environmental,  Social  and Governance (ESG) reporting. Furthermore, the Committee regularly addressed the monitoring of the effectiveness of the control functions (in particular, Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering function, Group Audit). The monitoring the Management Board in the remediation of findings related to the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes was another focal point of the Committee's  work,  in  addition  to  the  Findings  Management  program  for  the  accelerated  reduction  of  critical  findings.  In addition, the Committee addressed, against the backdrop of Wirecard's insolvency, the potential implications for the auditor of our annual and consolidated financial statements, in particular with regard to the auditor's independence.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met a total of six times during the reporting period, including one extraordinary meeting together with the Chairman's Committee. Four meetings were conducted on-site, and two meetings were held as video conferences. The Nomination Committee extensively addressed succession planning for the Management Board and Supervisory Board in consideration of the statutory and regulatory requirements and diversity principles. In this context, the Nomination Committee addressed in consultation with the Chairman's Committee the changes on the Management Board resulting from the departure from the Management Board of Ms. Riley and Mr. von Rohr. Furthermore, the Committee resolved to recommend that the Supervisory Board nominate Ms. Mayree Clark, Mr. John Thain, Ms. Michele Trogni and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann for re-election to the Supervisory Board at the General Meeting. In addition, the Committee addressed the composition of the Supervisory Board committees, the induction of new members of the Supervisory Board and of the Management Board, the Management Board's training measures, the regular review of our internal policies and procedures, as well as topics related to the ('fit and proper') suitability of members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board. Other topics included the annual assessment of the Supervisory Board and Management Board in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG) and the advancement of diversity.",

At its meetings, the Committee focused in particular on monitoring the structure of the compensation systems for the Management Board and for employees. The Committee submitted proposals for the objectives for the year 2023 and for determining the variable compensation of the Management Board for the year 2022. The Committee also addressed personnel-related changes on the Management Board with a corresponding adjustment of the individual objectives. Furthermore, it dealt with the regulatory developments and regulatory findings on compensation topics and addressed, also with the support of external advisors, the examination of the existence of the preconditions for the suspension, forfeiture or claw-back of elements of variable compensation of (former) members of the Management Board. To the extent required, it adopted resolutions and developed recommendations on resolution proposals for the Supervisory Board plenum. Another focal point was addressing the Compensation Report on the compensation of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, which, pursuant to Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), was to be submitted for approval by the General Meeting and subsequently published along with the auditor's opinion. Furthermore, the Committee monitored the identification of Material Risk Takers and the determination of the total amount of variable compensation for the 2022 financial year as well as the decisions on the compensation for the heads of the Compliance and Risk functions. The Compensation Control Committee also addressed the revision of the compensation system for the Management Board, which is to be submitted for approval to the General Meeting 2024. The new system is intended to align the basis for the Management Board members' performance assessment more closely to shareholders' interests. Starting  2024,  the  long-term  variable compensation component will therefore no longer be measured on the basis of the business performance in preceding years, but on how financial and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals develop in each following three-year period.\n\nThe Regulatory Oversight Committee met six times in 2023. One meeting was conducted on-site, two meetings were video conferences, and three meetings were held as hybrid meetings. The Regulatory Oversight Committee was informed by the Management Board on an ongoing basis about contacts with regulators with a significant relevance for the business activity and especially about special audits, substantial complaints and other exceptional measures on the part of German and foreign bank regulatory authorities, to the extent they do not relate to financial reports or audit matters. The Management Board reported in every meeting on the status of the remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings. In addition, reports were given to the Committee at its meetings on significant internal investigations and their progress. In parallel, the Regulatory Oversight Committee continues to deal with preventive compliance controls and litigation cases with the highest risks from the bank's perspective.\n\nThe  Strategy  and  Sustainability  Committee  met  four  times.  Two  meetings  were  conducted  on-site  and  two  as  video conferences. At its meetings, the Committee intensively addressed the bank's strategic transformation and regularly obtained reports  on  this  from  the  Management  Board.

In this context, the Committee addressed the progress made in the bank's key deliverables to achieve operational efficiency increases as well as the portfolio of key business units.

Focus areas in 2023 were the Group-wide technology strategy, the topic of data management, the implementation of key bank-wide technology programs, cyber and information security as well as innovations in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Furthermore, in 2023 the Committee extensively addressed the migration of the retail banking platform and received updates on the bank's corresponding program, including details on incident management and decommissioning measures. In addition, the Committee received detailed reporting on the IT strategies and roadmaps of the  business  divisions  as  well  as  reports  on  the  migration  to  the  cloud,  the  remediation  of  regulatory  findings  and  the implementation of the bank's front-to-back programs. With regard to cyber and information security, the Committee discussed the current security situation and the metrics for its assessment, as well as the risks and actions resulting from the geopolitical situation in China and Russia. In order to support the Risk Committee with regard to the overall risk strategy, the Technology, Data and Innovation Committee addressed risk and control management within the Technology, Data and Innovation area as well as the related key deliverables.\n\nMeetings of the Mediation Committee, established pursuant to the provisions of Germany's Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), were not necessary.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  its  committees  is  in  accordance  with  the  legal  requirements  as  well  as regulatory governance standards. The European Central Bank reviewed and confirmed the professional qualifications and the personal reliability of our members within the framework of its suitability assessment. The suitability assessment covers the expertise,  reliability  and  time  available  of  each  individual  member.  In  addition,  there  was  an  assessment  of  the  entire Supervisory Board's knowledge, skills and experience that are necessary for the performance of its tasks (collective suitability). The European Central Bank's Joint Supervisory Team and the Nomination Committee continually monitor the suitability of the Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the chairpersons of all the committees coordinated their work continually and consulted each other regularly and - as required - on an ad hoc basis between the meetings in order to ensure the exchange of information necessary to capture and assess all relevant matters and risks in the performance of their tasks. The cooperation in the committees was marked by an open and trustful atmosphere.\n\nThe  committee  chairpersons  reported  regularly  at  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board  on  the  work  of  the  individual committees.  Regularly  before  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  representatives  of  the  employees  and  the representatives of the shareholders conducted preliminary discussions separately. At the beginning or end of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, discussions were regularly held in 'Executive Sessions' without the participation of the Management Board.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  the  chairpersons  of  the  committees  engaged  regularly  in  discussions  with representatives of various regulators and informed them about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees and about the cooperation with the Management Board.\n\nTogether  with  the  bank's  Investor  Relations  Department,  the  Supervisory  Board  Chairman  conducted  discussions  with investors, proxy advisors and shareholders' associations. The subjects of the discussions were governance and strategy topics from the Supervisory Board's perspective, questions related to appointments of personnel and succession planning, the  bank's  control  processes,  Management  Board  compensation,  and  the  Supervisory  Board's  view  of  the  bank's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy.\n\nAt several meetings of the Nomination Committee and of the Supervisory Board in plenum, we addressed the assessment prescribed by law of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 financial year, which also comprises the self-assessment according to the German Corporate Governance Code. The final discussion of the results took place at a meeting of the Supervisory Board plenum on January 31, 2024, and the results were set out in a final report.\n\nFor  further  information,  for  example,  on  the  Audit  Committee  financial  experts,  the  compensation  experts  and  the independence of the individual members, we refer to the 'Supervisory Board' section in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which we had last issued with the Management Board in October 2022, was reissued in October 2023. The text of the Declaration of Conformity, along with a comprehensive presentation of the bank's corporate governance, can be found in the Annual Report and on the bank's website at https://www.db.com/ir/en/ documents.htm. Our Declarations of Conformity and Corporate Governance Statements from the past five years are also available there, in addition to the currently applicable versions of the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as for the Management Board.\n\n## Training and further education measures\n\nWe held several training sessions in 2023, as in prior years. They were conducted in most cases by external subject matter experts, but also by internal experts. The training focused on topics such as artificial intelligence, climate and environmental risks as well as macroeconomic developments and their effects on the bank. Furthermore, we received an outlook for the global and regulatory environment in the financial services sector for the year 2023 (including topic areas such as geopolitics and regulatory fragmentation, economic conditions and impacts on clients, digital assets, the digitalization of financial services, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, combating financial crime, strategic agility and operational resilience, and regulatory requirements).\n\nFor  the  new  members  that  joined  the  Supervisory  Board,  extensive  induction  courses  tailored  to  them  individually  were developed and carried out to facilitate their induction into office.",

        "page_content": "## Conflicts of interest and their handling\n\nWe continually strive to identify and prevent potential conflicts of interest on the part of our members as early as possible and arrange for their mitigation.\n\nFollowing  the  election  of  the  employee  representatives  to  the  Supervisory  Board  on  April  5,  2023,  Ms.  Gerlinde  Siebert informed us that her role as Global Head of Governance may overlap with tasks of the Regulatory Oversight Committee. Through in-depth discussions, the Supervisory Board was able to ensure itself that any resulting conflict of interest does not stand in the way of an unrestricted participation on the Supervisory Board. Ms. Gerlinde Siebert did not become a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee, so no potential conflict of interest exists.\n\nAlso, the performance of external mandates by our Supervisory Board members at other companies and management bodies is regularly reviewed for potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Annual Financial Statements, Consolidated Financial Statements, and the combined separate Non-Financial Report and Compensation Report\n\nEY GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (EY) audited the Annual Financial Statements, including the accounting and the Combined Management Report for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2023 financial year and issued in each case an unqualified audit opinion on March 11, 2024. The Auditor's Reports were signed jointly by the Auditors Mr. Mai and Mr. L\u00f6sken.\n\nFurthermore, EY performed a limited assurance review in the context of the combined separate Non-Financial Report as well as the Non-Financial Statement (Non-Financial Reporting) and in each case issued an unqualified opinion. EY issued a separate unqualified opinion for the Compensation Report.\n\nThe Audit Committee examined the documents for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements 2023 as well as the Non-Financial Reporting 2023 at its meeting on March 12, 2024. Representatives of EY provided the final report on the audit results. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to us on this at the meeting of the Supervisory Board. Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, and after inspecting the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements documents as well as the documents for the Non-Financial Reporting and following an extensive discussion on the Supervisory Board as well as with the representatives of the auditor, we noted the results of the audits with approval. We determined that, also based on the final results of our inspections, there are no objections to be raised.\n\nToday, we approved the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by the Management Board. The Annual Financial Statements are thus established. We agree to the proposal for the appropriation of distributable profit.\n\n## Personnel issues\n\nThe term of office of Ms. Mayree Clark, Mr. John Thain, Ms. Michele Trogni and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann ended as scheduled with the conclusion of the General Meeting on May 17, 2023. In accordance with our proposal, the General Meeting re-elected all four of these shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, in each case for a term of office of around four years.\n\nWith the conclusion of the General Meeting on May 17, 2023, the term of office of the employee representatives on the Supervisory  Board  came  to  an  end.  Mr.  Jan  Duscheck,  Ms.  Manja  Eifert  and  Mr.  Timo  Heider  were  re-elected  to  the Supervisory Board. Newly elected as employee representatives to the Supervisory Board were Ms. Susanne Bleidt, Ms. Claudia Fieber, Ms. Birgit Laumen, Ms. Gerlinde Siebert, Mr. Frank Schulze, Mr. Stephan Szukalski (elected for the third time to the Supervisory Board) and Mr. J\u00fcrgen T\u00f6gel.\n\nMs. Birgit Laumen stepped down from her office with effect from January 12, 2024. Mr. Florian Haggenmiller was appointed by the court as her successor with effect from January 16, 2024.",

Mr. Karl von Rohr had informed us that he would not be seeking to renew his Management Board Service Contract beyond the intended expiry on October 31, 2023. Ms. Christiana Riley decided to take up a challenge outside of the bank and stepped down from her Management Board mandate with effect from May 17, 2023, and left the bank with effect from May 31, 2023. We appointed Mr. Claudio de Sanctis with effect from July 1, 2023, to the Management Board as Mr. Karl von Rohr's successor, to ensure an orderly transition in the position. On October 25, 2023, we resolved to extend Ms. Rebecca Short's Management Board appointment by three years to April 30, 2027.\n\nAll resolutions were based on the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the Chairman's Committee.\n\nWe sincerely thank the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the members who left last year for their dedicated work and their constructive assistance to the company during the past years.\n\nFurthermore, we would also like to express our deep appreciation and thanks to the bank's employees for their great personal dedication.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, March 13, 2024\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\nAlexander Wynaendts\n\nChairman",

The Global Hausbank strategy is underpinned by three key themes: risk management, sustainability and technology, which have become even more important considering the ongoing geopolitical and macro-economic challenges. In this environment, Deutsche Bank aims to leverage a more favorable interest rate environment, deploy risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital to high-return growth opportunities. As sustainability becomes ever more important, the bank aims to deepen its dialogue with and support for clients and broaden the agenda in respect of the bank's own operations. As technology continues to evolve, Deutsche Bank aims to achieve further cost savings, accelerate the transition to a digital bank and expand upon strategic partnerships, which are already creating substantial value. At the same time, Deutsche Bank continues to work towards a long-term set-up that will enable a future of sustainable growth. This includes a clear definition of its purpose, vision and culture.\n\n## Deutsche Bank's key performance indicators 2025\n\n## Financial targets and capital objectives for 2025\n\n## Financial targets:\n\n- -Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of above 10% for the Group\n- -Compound annual growth rate of revenues between 2021 and 2025 of 5.5 to 6.5% (raised from 3.5 to 4.5%)\n- -Cost/income ratio of less than 62.5%\n\n## Capital objectives:\n\n- -Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 13%\n- -50% Total payout ratio from 2025\n\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets, including the compound annual growth rate of revenues target which it has raised from 3.5-4.5% to 5.5-6.5% at the beginning of 2024, as well as its capital objectives for 2025.\n\nPost-tax  Return  on  Average  Tangible  Equity  and  adjusted  costs  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Please  refer  to 'Supplementary financial information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP financial measures' of this report for the definitions of such measures and reconciliations to the IFRS numbers on which they are based.\n\n## Progress on strategy implementation\n\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank made further progress in accelerating the execution of its Global Hausbank strategy on all dimensions: revenue growth, operational and capital efficiency.\n\nRevenues grew to around \u20ac 29 billion, and the revenue growth rate was close to 7% per year since 2021 as benefits of the sharpened business model came through. The bank made conscious investment decisions in 2023 to further develop its franchise, mainly to drive business growth, strengthen controls and improve operational efficiency. Deutsche Bank believes that the bank has reached an inflection point on costs with these investments approaching completion. Furthermore, the bank demonstrated resilience, with high-quality risk management and a strong capital and balance sheet, resulting in both dividends and share buybacks increased by 50% compared to 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue growth\n\nOn revenue growth, Deutsche Bank believes that the bank delivered sustained growth from a well-balanced business mix. For example, the bank took advantage of rising interest rates, notably in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank, but also focused on increasing the bank's fee income across all fee-generating businesses. Corporate Bank developed innovative products, hired relationship managers in strategic areas, and deepened relationships with key clients. Investment Bank continued to execute against its strategic priorities, including completing the acquisition of Numis to enhance its ability to deliver its service offering to its clients. Furthermore, Investment Bank and International Private Bank added senior bankers in client-facing areas. The bank also attracted net inflows of \u20ac 57 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management, which has helped grow Assets under Management by \u20ac 115 billion to \u20ac 1.5 trillion across these businesses.\n\nGiven the progress achieved, Deutsche Bank raised its compound annual growth target for the period between 2021 and 2025 from 3.5 - 4.5% to 5.5 - 6.5% at the beginning of 2024, after outperforming the bank's original target in both 2022 and 2023. The bank's expectation is that the achievement of the revised target will be supported by growth of noninterest income from a growing market share in Corporate Bank, reaping the benefits of investments in Origination & Advisory, building on the bank's recent strong relative performance in the Fixed Income and Currencies (FIC) business, growing fees from investment products in Private Bank and expanding certain lending businesses. In Asset Management, the bank plans to take full advantage of the market recovery that started at the end of 2023 to grow further in Passive and Alternatives. Additionally, Private Bank and Asset Management aim to convert 2023's net inflows and growth in assets under management into revenues.\n\n## Operational efficiency\n\nDeutsche Bank made further progress on its \u20ac 2.5 billion operational efficiency program during 2023 and already realized savings  from  completed  efficiency  measures.  The  bank  expects  the  remaining  savings  to  result  from  the  execution  of measures relating to infrastructure and technology efficiencies, including application decommissioning and operating model improvements,  optimization  of  the  bank's  platform  in  Germany  and  front-to-back  process  redesign,  including  simplified workflows and automation. These measures are also expected to lead to a reduction of approximately 3,500 roles, mainly in non-client-facing areas, of which some have already left the platform. The bank aims for a quarterly run-rate of adjusted costs of \u20ac 5 billion in 2024 and aims to operate with total noninterest expenses of around \u20ac 20 billion in 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank's 2023 cost base was impacted by inflation, business growth and investments to accelerate execution of the bank's Global Hausbank strategy. Some of the investments to accelerate strategy execution are non-recurring and mainly related  to  improvements  of  the  bank's  operational  efficiency  as  outlined  above  and  real  estate  one-offs.  The  bank  also recognized  an  impairment  of  goodwill  related  to  Numis  in  2023.  In  addition,  Deutsche  Bank  made  investments  that  are expected to continue to impact the bank's cost base. On business growth, the bank has invested in businesses which are less capital intensive and on controls, it further strengthened key functions.\n\nInvestment in innovation and digitalization remains a key focus area of Deutsche Bank's operational efficiency targets. In 2023, the bank has broadened its technological reach with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) including with the testing of Google Cloud's AI tools. Opportunities from AI are expected in operations and process automation to enable investments in client solutions and fuel revenue growth.",

        "page_content": "## Capital efficiency\n\nWith respect to capital efficiency, Deutsche Bank reduced risk-weighted assets (RWA) in 2023, already putting the bank on track regarding its ambition for RWA reductions of \u20ac 25 to 30 billion by 2025. These measures, together with strong organic capital generation, enabled Deutsche Bank to increase its CET1 ratio to 13.7% as of year end 2023, up from 13.4% at year end 2022. Deutsche Bank aims to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13%, i.e., to operate with a buffer of 200 basis points above the bank's expected maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold, also after the impacts from the adoption of CRR 3, which is expected to become effective on January 1, 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank plans to sustainably grow cash dividends and, over time, return to shareholders through share buybacks excess capital over and above the requirements to support profitable growth and upcoming regulatory changes. For the financial year 2023, the Management Board intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of \u20ac 0.45 per share, after having paid a dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022 and \u20ac 0.20 per share for 2021. For the financial year 2024 and subsequent years, the bank targets a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders, delivered through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks. These distributions to shareholders are subject to shareholder authorization and German corporate law requirements, and in the case of share buybacks additionally require prior regulatory approval. Deutsche Bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by at least 50% year on year in 2024. The bank has received supervisory approval for a share repurchase of \u20ac 675 million, which it aims materially to complete in the first  half  of  2024,  having  completed  \u20ac 450 million  in  share  repurchases  in  2023;  and  Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  propose  a dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of \u20ac 0.45 per share, or approximately \u20ac 900 million, up from \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022, at the bank's Annual General Meeting in May 2024. For the financial years 2024 and 2025, Deutsche Bank aims for cash dividends of \u20ac 0.68 and \u20ac 1.00 per share, respectively, subject to a 50% payout ratio limitation relative to net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders. The bank has set a capital distribution goal of \u20ac 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-2025, paid in 2022-2026, and believes that it is positioned to exceed this objective based on the achievement of the bank's financial targets.\n\nThe rating agencies recognized the continued progress the bank has made over the course of 2023, specifically further improvements in profitability. This was reflected in upgrades by S&P, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS during the year. In May, S&P raised its outlook on the bank to positive. DBRS Morningstar upgraded all Deutsche Bank's long-term ratings by one notch in June. Fitch upgraded the bank's ratings by one notch in July. Towards the end of 2023, S&P upgraded Deutsche Bank's credit ratings, the fourth successive upgrade of Deutsche Bank's credit ratings by a leading rating agency during 2023. S&P highlighted the bank's progress in growing the franchise, strengthening earnings, and maintaining solid capital and liquidity profiles.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nDeutsche Bank has the strong intention to support and accelerate the historic transformation towards a more sustainable society and economy. Consequently, Deutsche Bank's Management Board made sustainability a management priority in 2019.\n\nTo underpin this, the bank hosted its 2 nd Sustainability  Deep Dive in March 2023, where senior leaders reported on the progress in implementing the bank's sustainability strategy in the specific business and infrastructure areas. The focus was on how the bank plans to embed environmental, social and governance aspects into products, policies, and processes. The sustainability strategy focuses on the following four pillars:\n\n- -Sustainable finance: navigating the bank's clients on their sustainability journey by being deeply embedded in their decision making and processes, supported by an innovative and data-driven offering\n- -Policies and commitments: maintaining and developing dedicated control frameworks and processes to turn regulatory challenges into business opportunities and steer decision-making based on impact measurement\n- -People  and  own  operations:  building  a  sustainability-led  organization  driven  by  value-based  leadership,  empowered employees - embedding environmental and social aspects deeply in the bank's processes\n- -Thought leadership and stakeholder engagement: playing a pivotal role for government agencies, academia and interest groups to accelerate standard setting locally and internationally\n\nBy implementing this strategy, the bank aims to maximize its contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals. Deutsche Bank has endorsed multiple universal sustainability frameworks and initiatives,  such  as  the  UN's  Environment  Programme  Finance  Initiative,  the  UN  Global  Compact,  and  the  Principles  for Responsible Banking.\n\nTo measure and report transparently about the progress, Deutsche Bank has set the following targets and goals:\n\n- -The bank wants to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes of \u20ac 500 billion in the period from January 2020 to end of 2025 (excluding DWS); which transactions can be classified as sustainable is documented in Deutsche Bank's Sustainable Finance Framework and published on Deutsche Bank's website\n- -It  wants to achieve the bank's net-zero commitment by 2050 and has, therefore, published net-zero targets for seven carbon-intensive sectors in the bank's corporate loan book by end of 2030 (interim) and end of 2050 (final)\n- -The bank plans to ensure that at least 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President roles are held by women by 2025\n- -It wants to reduce emissions in the bank's own operations and supply chain (Scope 1, Scope 2 and disclosed Scope 3: Category 1 to 14) by 46% by the end of 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline\n\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank continued to deliver on the targets, goals and pillars of the bank's sustainability strategy. For example, the bank:\n\n- -Published its initial Transition Plan summarizing the bank's decarbonization strategy and actions along three dimensions: own operations (Scope 1 and 2), supply chain (disclosed Scope 3: Category 1 to 14); and the financing the bank provides to its clients (Scope 3: Category 15)\n- -Announced three additional sectoral emission reduction targets in the corporate loan portfolio for Shipping, Cement and Coal Mining after having published pathway targets for four sectors in the previous year (i.e., Oil & Gas, Automotive, Power Generation and Steel)\n- -Updated the bank's thermal coal guideline by tightening the criteria on when a company is deemed a thermal coal company and in scope of the guideline, as well as specifying the requirements to be applied to clients in scope of the updated guideline\n- -Rolled out a 'Sustainable Finance' training for client facing staff, and funded community conservation projects in several Asia-Pacific countries by partnering with The Nature Conservancy\n- -Further enhanced the bank's risk management and related processes to prevent human rights violations in the supply chain in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act\n\nTo reinforce Deutsche Bank's sustainability strategy, the transformation of the bank with regards to sustainability-related targets and goals is a component for the bank's top executives' performance-based compensation.\n\nThis section does not cover DWS which sets its own sustainability strategy.

Corporate Bank's capabilities in Cash Management, Trade Finance and Lending in close collaboration with Foreign Exchange in the Investment Bank enable the division to serve the core needs of corporate clients. As a leading bank serving multinational and German corporates domestically and abroad, the Corporate Bank helps clients in optimizing their working capital and liquidity, securing global supply chains and distribution channels and managing their risks (source: EUROMONEY). Furthermore, Corporate Bank acts as a specialized provider of services to financial institutions, offering Correspondent Banking, Trust and Agency Services as well as Securities Services. Finally, the division provides Business Banking services to small corporate and entrepreneur clients in Germany through a standardized product suite.\n\nCorporate Bank has defined a number of specific initiatives to capitalize on its core competencies across these different areas to grow revenues to achieve its targets. In particular, the division's investments in new initiatives and experience in managing complex situations for clients, such as uncertainties associated with increasing geopolitical tensions, lower economic growth in  the  major  operating  countries  from  ongoing  supply  chain  disruptions,  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices  as  well  as uncertainty around central bank policies, allow Corporate Bank to prove its advisory and solution capabilities.\n\nIn 2023, Corporate Bank continued to make progress on the business segment's strategic objectives, benefiting from rising interest rates and a strong pricing discipline. In July 2023, Deutsche Bank was selected as the new issuing partner for the Lufthansa Miles & More Credit Card, Europe's leading loyalty program, from mid-2025. In addition, the segment intends to further expand its digital offerings, for example Corporate Bank applied to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in the second quarter of 2023 to obtain a license for the custody of digital assets.\n\nLooking ahead, Corporate Bank is expected to continue to act as an integral part of the Global Hausbank strategy  and contribute  to  Deutsche  Bank's  2025  objectives.  The  segment  sees  growth  opportunities  across  all  core  client  groups Corporate,  Institutional,  Business  Banking,  both  from  existing  Corporate  Bank  strengths  and  from  new  products.  The segment's global network across 140 countries combined with profound local knowledge, a comprehensive product suite and tailored client offering, should continue to offer competitive advantages versus the division's peers. Corporate Bank continues working towards its strategic ambitions, leveraging its strong brand and deep client relationships and aiming to offer a full range of advisory and financing solutions for corporate treasurers. The segment wants to remain the trusted partner for the German economy and build on its standing as the leading Corporate Bank in its home market. The segment is also committed to  connect  financial  institutions  worldwide,  a  business  where  it  is  one  of  the  market  leaders  (source:  SWIFT  Euro  peer benchmarking).\n\nCorporate  Bank's  initiatives  will  target  revenue  growth  with  corporate  clients  across  cash  management  and  payments, including growing its fee-based business with institutional clients and expanding lending.\n\nAs the segment seeks to grow its business with clients globally, Corporate Bank commits to apply sound risk management principles to maintain its high-quality loan portfolio and strict lending standards. Equally, the segment sees further potential to reduce its cost base from technology and front-to-back process optimization as well as automation and location strategy.\n\nMoreover, as a transition partner, Corporate Bank helps its clients across sector value chains to achieve their strategic goals by offering a broad suite of sustainable finance solutions and sector aligned ESG industry expertise. Also, Corporate Bank aims to enable the accelerated renewables and infrastructure build-out through asset and project finance capabilities including new technologies like storage solutions, hydrogen and carbon management.",

        "page_content": "## Investment Bank\n\nThe Investment Bank is a key pillar of Deutsche Bank's business. Across FIC and Origination and Advisory, corporate and institutional clients access a comprehensive range of services, encompassing, financing, market making/liquidity provision, risk management solutions, advisory, and debt and equity issuance. The segment regionally encompasses EMEA, Americas and APAC across both Investment Bank businesses and client footprint.\n\nIn  2023,  underlying  markets were less conducive to client flows versus a very strong 2022 and the resulting uncertainty continued to depress levels of capital market and advisory activity. Despite this, the Investment Bank continued to execute against its strategic priorities, delivering an enhanced service offering to its clients and building on the progress made since the formation of the business in 2019.\n\nThe development of the Investment Bank's FIC business has been pronounced, with the long-term growth in revenue and market share reflecting the successful delivery against strategic objectives across multiple areas of the business. This success has been driven by a wide range of factors. A strong and stable management team is in place, with the segment demonstrating its ability to attract leading talent via a number of specific and targeted senior hires into sub-business leadership positions through 2023. A defined technology strategy is delivering simplified and sustainable capability - with over 175 applications decommissioned in the past two years - and investment into areas across the business is enabling product enhancements and the development of new capability for the division's clients. This has been demonstrated by workflow solutions, which provide clients access to Deutsche Bank's product suite in a simplified and operationally efficient manner. The continued focus on the division's clients has been enhanced via the creation of dedicated relationship management and client enablement functions within the Institutional Coverage Group. This ensures deeper strategic relationships with clients, whilst providing them with the most efficient ways of working with Deutsche Bank. This is further enhanced by the significant increase in client engagement  following  the  recent  rating  upgrades.  The  continued  success  has  also  been  recognized  externally.  As  an example, Euromoney recognized Deutsche Bank as the leading global FX provider for a second year in a row.\n\nIn  an  environment where fee pools continued to be restricted, the focus of Origination & Advisory has been building the platform to ensure the business is positioned to benefit when activity is expected to return in 2024. A significant number of targeted senior hires have been made, with a focus upon sectors and regions where Deutsche Bank is able to compete but is currently underweight. Alongside this organic growth, the acquisition of Numis will further enhance Origination & Advisory's depth of offering in the UK, the largest EMEA fee pool, whilst also enabling the cross-sell of other segmental products into the client base. To ensure that strong relationships are maintained with clients, the business has established a Client Strategy and Analytics team which will drive the depth of relationships with its client base and ensure close monitoring of performance at the most granular level.\n\nIn 2024, the strategy of the Investment Bank is focused on working towards its vision of being the leading non-U.S. global investment bank and delivering upon the segment's growth and return targets. This is aimed to be achieved via targeted growth investments and the continued development of its client strategy, combined with a focus on technology, data enabled capability, capital efficiency and control.\n\nThe investments made into the Origination & Advisory franchise are expected to increase the weighting of strategic advisory revenues as a percentage of total revenues over time. Within FIC, investment into existing businesses in areas where the division  has  a  competitive  advantage  will  continue.  This  will  be  complemented  by  the  expansion  into  a  small  number  of adjacent businesses where the existing platform and client base can be leveraged to enable growth at low marginal costs. The result of each of these will be a further diversification of revenue streams, whilst also ensuring an enhanced and relevant product offering for the client base.\n\nFinally, ESG remains a priority across the Investment Bank as the segment continues supporting its clients globally. Deutsche Bank held its second Sustainability Deep Dive in March 2023, providing insight into the different approaches that the bank has developed with clients across the globe. From a transaction perspective there were a number of key events in 2023 including completing a bespoke deal-contingent interest rate hedge and a tailored financing for Hai Long, Taiwan's largest offshore wind project  to  date,  and  acting  as  global  coordinator  and  joint  active  bookrunner  on  Air  France-KLM's  \u20ac 1 billion  inaugural sustainability-linked long 3-year and long 5-year bond offering.",

        "page_content": "## Private Bank\n\nPrivate Bank is structured along two core businesses: Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. Private Bank serves personal and private clients, wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs and families. Within the segment, the international businesses  also  focus  on  commercial  clients.  With  over  20 million  clients  and  a  broad  range  of  financial  services  in 19 countries, Private Bank significantly contributes to Deutsche Bank's global businesses. The segment continued to drive a disciplined approach towards achieving its strategic and financial objectives. The achievements throughout 2023 enabled Private Bank to further close the gap towards its 2025 targets. Private Bank's progress in evolving its businesses was also in line with the Group's ambition across growth, operational and capital efficiency.\n\nPrivate Bank Germany is positioned as the market leading private bank in Germany and serves 19 million customers with its two major brands Deutsche Bank and Postbank. While Deutsche Bank continues to offer private customers high-quality advisory services with outstanding individual product solutions, the customers of the Postbank brand benefit from non-complex and standardized product offerings alongside postal and parcel services in cooperation with Deutsche Post DHL. Across its omni-channel offerings, Private Bank customers not only have access to a nationwide branch network but also to diverse banking solutions via direct sales, mobile sales and distribution partners.\n\nIn 2023, Private Bank Germany increased its revenues materially versus the prior year, supported by robust growth in deposits and successful campaigns for fixed rate products. While mortgage lending business remained at a stable level, Private Bank Germany's assets under management in the investment business increased compared to the prior year, driven by high inflows as  a  result  of  the  positive  market  development.  Furthermore,  Private  Bank  Germany  continued  to  work  on  its  strategic transformation. This included the continued transformation of the sub-division's go-to-market model including the reduction of Postbank branches to approximately 550 at year end 2023 and the implementation of new branch concepts. In the upcoming years, Private Bank Germany plans to further adjust its go-to-market model and strengthen its digital proposition. Additionally, Private  Bank  Germany  completed  one  of  the  largest  customer  migrations  in  the  European  banking  market  in  2023. Twelve million customers with 19 million contracts were migrated to a unified platform for all customers in Germany paving the way for decommissioning all former Postbank Group legacy applications and enabling the bank to further drive its digital transformation. The migration resulted in a higher number of client requests leading to a backlog of unresolved requests. Private Bank Germany is prioritizing a remediation plan to improve capacities, address client concerns and to return to the target operational service levels.\n\nInternational  Private  Bank  has  a  well-diversified  revenue  mix  across  regions  with  client  segments  focused  on  Wealth Management, Bank for Entrepreneurs and Premium Banking. The business targets ultra-high net worth family entrepreneurs globally and affluent clients across Europe focused on a digitally led model, with a larger ambition to be the global house of choice for entrepreneurs.\n\nInternational Private Bank maintained its strong momentum in attracting client inflows with positive net inflows in assets under management in each quarter for four consecutive years despite difficult market conditions in 2023. International Private Bank's flagship  strategic  asset  allocation  and  innovative  private  market/ultra-high  net  worth  focused  solutions  have  significantly contributed towards the International Private Bank's net new assets growth. Furthermore, the business continued its progress on several targeted initiatives to fulfil its strategic agenda, e.g., strengthening wealth management coverage and product teams in key markets supported by entrepreneur-focused strategic hires. The business has also applied strict cost discipline, thereby successfully managing costs in an inflationary environment. The benefits of both OneBank and Bank for Entrepreneurs approaches  were  reflected  in  the  business  successfully  addressing  the  complex  needs  of  wealthy  entrepreneur  clients. Furthermore,  in  Premium  Banking,  the  business  continued  its  strategic  transformation  journey  toward  digital-first  remote advisory and client engagement services, while optimizing and innovating the branch footprint.\n\nIn ESG, Private Bank announced its strategy for the upcoming years at Deutsche Bank's Sustainability Deep Dive in March 2023, further substantiating its overall ESG value proposition through product portfolio enhancements, strategic thematic collaborations and focused inhouse ESG enablement efforts. This was aimed at supporting clients in their overall sustainable transition journeys.\n\nIn July 2023, Private Bank announced a new organizational set-up to further enhance the segment's capabilities and to achieve its 2025 targets. Commencing from the first quarter of 2024, the Private Bank will follow a customer-focused approach with two client sub-segments: 'Wealth Management & Private Banking' and 'Personal Banking'. Wealth Management & Private Banking will combine Private Banking, high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients globally. 'Personal Banking' includes all retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients across specific international regions. These commercial banking  clients  consist  of  small  business  clients  and  small-sized  corporate  clients  that  are  not  covered  by  the  Wealth Management & Private Banking sub-segment.",

The aim is to maintain market leadership in Germany, building on expertise and customer relationships, in addition to expanding existing partnerships and developing new distribution channels, to gain additional market share. DWS sees additional market potential especially in Alternatives investments and Passive funds, represented by the Xtrackers brand. The overall strategy also takes account of sustainability and in 2023, DWS updated its sustainability strategy to clearly define its priorities.\n\nThe Growth strategy is built on the strength in Passive and Alternatives businesses. The Passive business, with the Xtrackers brand, in the division's view offers sustained and profitable growth potential, which provides sufficient scalability. Building on the franchise and European business, DWS has decided to invest in a US growth plan including sustainability, thematic and Active ETFs. Further, DWS sees a strong demand for mandates in Asia Pacific, and therefore plans to expand its customized mandates business. In addition to regional growth potential, DWS continues to see opportunities for bespoke Passive solutions to outperform broad index replication.\n\nIn Alternatives, investor interest in real estate slowed down in 2023, while demand in the infrastructure sector remained strong. However, DWS expects an increase in demand within Alternatives, and aims to facilitate closing the gap between capital demand and supply with private  capital  investment  solutions  in  Europe.  DWS  continues  to  focus  on  its  real  estate  and infrastructure investment platforms and positioning the division for growth in the private debt space.\n\nThe Value strategy aims to maintain leadership in mature markets for Active investment strategies, specifically Equity, Fixed Income and Multi Asset. In Equity, DWS intends to further grow the platform for Thematic Equities and make progress on offerings towards sustainability. Given the changing market environment and higher interest rates, DWS will further focus on Fixed Income and institutional investors. In Multi-Asset, the aim is to further strengthen solutions capabilities and enhance the modular investment platform to achieve more scale.\n\nThe Build strategy's emphasis on digitization trends aims to focus on asset management as-a-service and digital assets. DWS plans to build a respective modular offering which is scalable and integrated via application programming interfaces into offerings  of  new  and  existing  distribution  partners.  DWS  expects  increasing  tokenization  of  the  economy,  with  resulting changes in market structure, and aims to utilize new blockchain infrastructure, develop new products and reach digital native clients. In December 2023, DWS agreed to establish a joint venture with Galaxy Digital and Flow Traders, to bring together traditional  asset  management  expertise  with  digital  asset  know-how,  with  the  aim  of  issuing  a  fully  collateralized  eurodenominated stablecoin in a regulated environment.\n\nThe Reduce strategy intends to reallocate financial resources to fund investments in the Build and Growth areas. DWS will continuously  analyze  measures  to  increase  efficiency,  including  divesting  from  sub-scale  businesses  and  reduction  of management layers, thereby ensuring these measures do not have a negative impact on the ongoing business. In 2023, DWS completed the sale of its Private Equity solutions business unit. Additionally, DWS reduced management levels within the business as part of a broader efficiency program.\n\nBased on its strategy, DWS remains committed to deliver on its medium-term financial targets until 2025 of; earnings per share target of  \u20ac 4.50  in  2025,  adjusted  cost/income  ratio  of  below  59% by  2025  and  AuM growth  in  Passive,  including Xtrackers, and Alternatives of 12% and 10% respectively (compound annual growth rate 2022-2025).\n\nIn 2023, DWS updated its sustainability strategy and refined its sustainability priorities. The ambition is to enable clients to navigate the sustainable transformation of the real economy by providing them with investment expertise and solutions. The topic of climate change remains the core theme of the updated sustainability strategy, built around three priorities: focus on climate related investing, strengthen engagement with investees and other relevant stakeholders, and advance DWS' own corporate transformation to achieve commitment to net zero.",

Although the bank believes inflation has passed its  peak, the high price level continued to weigh on demand from private households. The tighter monetary  policy to combat inflation also slowed down the global economy                                                                                                                                  |\n| Of which:  Developed  countries | 1.6     |     2.6 | Developments in the developed countries varied. While the U.S. economy remained resilient at the end of  2023, the Eurozone economy was already slowing down noticeably. Central banks maintained peak interest  rates and signaled their intention to continue their data-driven monetary policy. Inflation rates continued to  fall but remained above the central banks' targets at the end of the year |\n| Emerging markets                | 4.2     |     3.9 | Developments in the emerging markets varied from region to region at the end of 2023. Asian countries  benefited from the momentum in China, while focus in Latin America was on combating inflation. High  energy prices and the spillovers of geopolitics continued to be a burden for countries in Central and Eastern  Europe                                                                          |\n| Eurozone Economy                | 0.5     |     3.4 | The Eurozone economy weakened in the second half of 2023. Private consumption continued to be  negatively impacted by the loss of purchasing power, even though inflation eased significantly. The labor  market was stable, as a result of companies holding on to staff. The ECB kept its key interest rates  unchanged in the fourth quarter 2023                                                       |\n| Of which: German  economy       | (0.3)   |     1.8 | The German economy continued to weaken until end of 2023, having previously more or less stagnated.  Private consumption remained weak, although the impact of inflation has eased. The labor market remained  robust and wage growth has already compensated for some loss of purchasing power                                                                                                            |\n| U.S. Economy                    | 2.5     |     1.9 | The U.S. economy slowed somewhat towards the end of 2023, with the labor market becoming more  balanced and inflationary pressure easing. Private household consumption remained robust. The Fed left its  key interest rates unchanged at a high level                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Japanese Economy                | 2.0     |     0.9 | The Japanese economy regained some momentum towards the end of the year. Private consumption  benefited from strong wage growth, while inflation did not weaken noticeably. The Bank of Japan's key  interest rates remained unchanged at their accommodative level                                                                                                                                        |\n| Asian Economy 4                 | 5.1     |     4.1 | The Asian economies benefited from China's recovery. Inflation trends varied regionally and were driven not  least by food prices. The weakening of global trade had a negative impact on exports                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Of which: Chinese  Economy      | 5.2     |     3   | As a result of fiscal and monetary policy support, the Chinese economy gained additional momentum in the  final quarter of 2023. Nevertheless, the property sector dampened the recovery in private consumption.  Inflation rates turned negative in the second half of 2023                                                                                                                               |",

Corporate credit volumes were nearly constant  throughout the year, following even greater momentum in 2022. Total deposits  contracted until spring and then flattened out, leading to a moderate shrinkage for  the full year. It is only the second time this has happened since records began in  1973, and the second time in a row after the mild contraction in 2022, which  followed the pandemic boom in 2020/2021 |\n| China                           | 14.4                 |               6.9 | 4.9                   | 13.7               | Corporate loans boomed, while retail loans expanded at less than half that pace.

The market stress has been more pronounced in the U.S., where property price indices point to a greater decline of CRE asset values from recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Especially within the office segment, the market weakness is most evident in the U.S., reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe.\n\nThe global Origination & Advisory industry fee pool in 2023 fell a further 16%, following a 35% drop in 2022 from record highs in 2021, driven by a subdued Mergers & Acquisitions market, challenging primary credit markets, and largely inactive sponsors. Mergers & Acquisitions in 2023 fell 23% but was still higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic fee pool of \u20ac 26 billion, while the fourth quarter 2023 had strong volumes. Equity Capital Markets issuance increased in 2023 as equity markets bounced back and volatility was low. The high yield market was up over 60% from a decade-long low, while leveraged loan issuance fell  17%  with  sponsors  choosing  to  continue  their  pause  on  acquisitions.  The  investment  grade  bond  market  remained relatively robust with issuance down 3% in 2023 and has had a strong start to 2024. Within Fixed Income, revenue pools remained at elevated levels compared to historical averages, although below the levels seen in 2022. Foreign exchange activity decreased across the ten most traded currencies globally, with Rates and Emerging Markets each declining from strong levels in the prior year. Conversely within Credit, an increase year on year was driven by a more favorable environment for secondary trading with the general trend of tightening spreads, while in Financing client demand remained stable and broadly aligned to prior year.",

In 2023, income tax expense included positive year end deferred tax asset (DTA) valuation adjustments of \u20ac 1.0 billion, largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK. This compared to a positive year end DTA valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2022 which related to the bank's U.S. operations. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.5 billion in 2023, up from \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2022, or 31 basis points of average loans, slightly above the bank's guidance, reflecting the continued challenging impact of macroeconomic and interest rate conditions on parts of the credit portfolio during 2023. Deutsche Bank published further details of its plans for distributions to shareholders, following raising its capital outlook by \u20ac 3 billion in October 2023. The bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by 50% in 2024. The bank has received supervisory approvals for share repurchases of \u20ac 675 million in 2024, having completed its \u20ac 450 million 2023 repurchase program, and plans to recommend a dividend of \u20ac 0.45 per share for 2023, up from \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022, at the Annual General Meeting in May 2024.\n\nProfit before tax was \u20ac 5.7 billion for the full year 2023, up 2% over 2022. Revenues grew by 6% to \u20ac 28.9 billion, and by 8% excluding specific items. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac 21.7 billion, up 6%, with growth driven primarily by nonoperating costs of  \u20ac 1.1 billion,  up  from  \u20ac 474 million  in  2022.  Adjusted  costs,  which  exclude  these  nonoperating  items,  rose  3%  to \u20ac 20.6 billion, as savings from efficiency measures partly offset costs relating to investments. The cost/income ratio was 75% in 2023, stable compared to 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity (RoE) was 6.7% compared to 8.4% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity (RoTE) was 7.4%, compared to 9.4% in 2022. The yearon-year development in both ratios partly reflects increased total equity due to organic capital generation and the higher income tax expense compared to 2022.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\n| Financial targets                                         | Financial targets  and  capital  objectives  2025   | Status end of  2023   | Status end of  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity\u00b9 | Above 10%                                           | 7.4%                  | 9.4%                  |\n| Compound annual growth rate of revenues from 2021 2       | 3.5 to 4.5% 3                                       | 6.6%                  | 7.1%                  |\n| Cost/income ratio 4                                       | Less than  62.5%                                    | 75.1%                 | 74.9%                 |\n| Capital objectives                                        |                                                     |                       |                       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 5                      | ~ 13% 6                                             | 13.7%                 | 13.4%                 |\n| Total payout ratio 7                                      | 50% 8                                               | 21%                   | 36%                   |\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 28.9 billion in 2023, up 6% year on year, and up 8% if adjusted for specific items. These items included a prior year gain on the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy of approximately \u20ac 310 million and \u20ac 125 million from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim in 2022, neither of which recurred in 2023. Both of these items arose in the Private Bank. Additionally, debt valuation adjustments in the Investment Bank had a \u20ac 47 million negative impact in 2023 versus a \u20ac 49 million benefit in 2022. Compound annual revenue growth since 2021 for the Group was 6.6%, well above the bank's original target of between 3.5% and 4.5% between 2021 and 2025. Given the progress achieved, the bank raised its target of a compound annual growth rate of revenues to 5.5 to 6.5% between 2021 and 2025 at the beginning of 2024.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.5 billion in 2023, or 31 basis points of average loans, slightly above the bank's previously announced guidance, reflecting the continued challenging impact of macro-economic and interest rate conditions on parts of the credit portfolio during the year. In 2022, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.2 billion, or 25 basis points of average loans.\n\nNoninterest  expenses  were  \u20ac 21.7 billion  in  2023,  up  6%  year  on  year.  This  development  largely  reflected  a  rise  in nonoperating  costs  to  \u20ac 1.1 billion,  up  from  \u20ac 474 million  in  2022,  largely  related  to  the  execution  of  the  bank's  Global Hausbank strategy. 2023 nonoperating costs included restructuring and severance expenses of \u20ac 566 million, compared to a release of \u20ac 8 million in 2022, and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets of \u20ac 233 million, up from \u20ac 68 million in 2022, driven by the goodwill impairment charge related to Numis. Adjusted costs were \u20ac 20.6 billion, up 3%. Investments in business growth, controls and efficiency measures were partly offset by the aforementioned realized savings from the bank's efficiency programs.",

The effective tax rate in 2023 of 14% benefited from the abovementioned positive year-end DTA valuation adjustments of \u20ac 1.0 billion, largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK.\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of 2023, up from 13.4% at the end of 2022. Organic capital generation more than offset the combined impacts of dividends, share buybacks, regulatory risk weighted asset inflation and business growth during the year. Capital efficiency measures, which form part of Deutsche Bank's accelerated execution of its Global Hausbank strategy, delivered RWA reductions of \u20ac 13 billion during 2023.\n\nRevenues excluding specific items, Adjusted costs, Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity and Net Assets (adjusted) are Non-GAAP financial measures.

The remaining portfolio, resources and employees are reported within the Corporate & Other segment. In line with the change, the Core Bank, which previously represented the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit, ceased to be reported as of the first quarter of 2023. Prior years comparatives have been aligned to the presentation in the current year.\n\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank has a country and regional organizational layer to facilitate a consistent implementation of global strategies.\n\nThe bank has operations or dealings with existing and potential customers in most countries in the world.

It considers the interests of shareholders, employees and other company-related stakeholders. The Management Board manages Deutsche Bank Group in accordance with uniform guidelines; it exercises general control over all entities and branches.\n\nThe Management Board decides on all matters prescribed by law and the Articles of Association and ensures compliance with the legal requirements and internal guidelines (compliance) and also takes the necessary measures to ensure that adequate internal guidelines are developed and implemented. The Management Board's responsibilities include the bank's strategic management and direction, the allocation of resources, financial accounting and reporting, control and risk management, as well as corporate control and a properly functioning business organization. The members of the Management Board are collectively responsible for managing the bank's business.\n\nThe allocation of functional responsibilities to the individual members of the Management Board is described in its Business Allocation Plan, which sets the framework for the delegation of responsibilities to senior management below the Management Board. The Management Board endorses individual accountability of senior position holders as opposed to joint decisiontaking in committees. At the same time, the Management Board recognizes the importance of having comprehensive and robust information across all businesses in order to take well informed decisions and established the 'Group Management Committee', which aims to improve the information flow across the corporate divisions and between the corporate divisions and  the  Management  Board  along  with  the  Infrastructure  Committees,  Business  Executive  Committees  and  Regional Committees. The Group Management Committee, which is not required by the German Stock Corporation Act, is a senior committee that is composed of all Management Board members and the most senior business representatives to exchange information and to discuss business, growth and profitability.\n\n## Corporate Bank\n\n## Corporate Division Overview\n\nCorporate Bank is primarily focused on serving corporate clients, including the German 'Mittelstand', larger and smaller sized commercial and business banking clients in Germany as well as multinational companies. The division also provides financial institutions  with  certain  transaction  banking  services.  Corporate  Bank  reports  revenues  based  on  three client  categories: Institutional Client Services, Corporate Treasury Services and Business Banking.\n\nThere have been no significant capital expenditures or divestitures since January 1, 2021.\n\n## Products and Services\n\nCorporate Bank is a global provider of risk management solutions, cash management, lending, trade finance, trust and agency services as well as securities services. Cash management services include integrated payments and FX solutions. Trade finance and lending offering spans from documentary and guarantee business to structured trade finance and lending. Trust and agency services cover depository receipts, corporate trust and document custody. Focusing on the finance departments of corporate and commercial clients and financial institutions in Germany and across the globe, its holistic expertise and global network allows the bank to offer integrated solutions.\n\nIn addition to Corporate Bank's product suite, coverage teams provide clients with access to the expertise of Investment Bank.\n\n## Distribution Channels and Marketing\n\nThe corporate coverage function of Corporate Bank focuses on international mid and large corporate clients and is organized into three units: Global Coverage, MidCorps Coverage and Risk Management Solutions. Coverage includes multi-product generalists  covering  headquarter  level  and  subsidiaries  via  global,  regional  and  local  coverage  teams  for  multinational companies. MidCorps Coverage includes multi-product generalists with a special focus to medium sized enterprises. Risk Management Solutions includes Foreign Exchange, Emerging Markets and Rates product specialists. This unit is managed regionally in Asia Pacific, Americas and EMEA to ensure close connectivity to clients.\n\nCorporate clients are served out of all three of the Corporate Bank's client categories. Corporate Treasury Services covers mid and large corporate clients across two brands, Deutsche Bank and Postbank, and offers the whole range of solutions across  cash,  trade  financing,  lending  and  risk  management  for  the  corporate  treasurer.

The Investment Bank focuses on its traditional strengths in these markets, bringing  together  wholesale  banking  expertise  across  risk  management,  sales  and  trading,  investment  banking  and infrastructure. This enables the Investment Bank to align resourcing and capital across its client and product perimeter to effectively support the bank's strategic goals.\n\nCommencing from the first quarter of 2024, Investment Bank introduces additional sub-categories to FIC Sales and Trading revenues, entitled 'Fixed Income & Currencies: Financing' and 'Fixed Income & Currencies: Ex Financing'. At the same time, FIC Sales and Trading will be renamed to 'Fixed Income & Currencies'. Origination & Advisory revenues will continue to be presented in the sub-categories Debt Origination, Equity Origination and Advisory. Additionally, Research revenues will be reported together with Other in the category 'Research and Other'.\n\nIn  April  2023,  Deutsche  Bank announced that it reached an agreement on an all-cash offer for the acquisition of Numis Corporation Plc ('Numis'). On October 13, 2023, Deutsche Bank completed the transaction and acquired a 100% interest in Numis for a cash purchase price of GBP 397 million. The acquisition is intended to allow Deutsche Bank to accelerate its Global Hausbank strategy by unlocking a much deeper engagement with corporate clients in the United Kingdom. After the initial purchase price allocation, a goodwill of \u20ac 233 million related to the transaction was identified. Deutsche Bank assigned the identified goodwill to the Investment Bank cash-generating unit ('CGU'). Given the value of the Investment Bank CGU, the goodwill was considered impaired and written off in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThere have been no significant divestitures since January 1, 2021.\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFIC Sales & Trading brings together institutional sales, trading and structuring expertise across Foreign Exchange, Rates, Emerging markets, Credit trading and Financing. The FIC Sales & Trading business operates globally and provides both corporate and institutional clients liquidity, market making services and a range of specialized risk management solutions across a broad range of FIC products, complemented by a comprehensive financing offering. The application of technology and continued innovation of transaction lifecycle processes is enabling Deutsche Bank to increase automation/electronification in order to respond to client and regulatory requirements.\n\nOrigination & Advisory is responsible for the division's debt origination business, mergers and acquisitions, and a focused equity advisory and origination platform. It is comprised of regional and industry-focused coverage teams, co-led from the bank's hubs in Europe, the U.S. and Asia Pacific. This facilitates the delivery of a range of financial products and services to the bank's corporate clients.\n\n## Distribution Channels and Marketing\n\nCoverage of the Investment Bank's clients is provided principally by three groups working in conjunction with each other: The Institutional Client Group, which houses the debt sales team, Investment Banking Coverage within Origination & Advisory and Risk Management Solutions in Corporate Bank, which covers capital markets and treasury solutions. The close cooperation between these groups helps to create enhanced synergies leading to increased cross selling of products/solutions to clients.",

Wealth Management & Private Banking combines the coverage of private banking, high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients, as well as business clients in selected international businesses. The client segment Personal Banking includes retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients in specific international businesses (i.e., all small business clients and small sized corporate clients that are not covered as part of the Wealth Management & Private Banking client segment).\n\nIn August 2021, Deutsche Bank SpA signed an agreement to sell its Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy to Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich Italy).

Private Bank also has collaborations with self-employed financial advisors and other sales and cooperation partners, including various cooperations with Business-to-Business-to-Consumer partners in Germany. For the Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs client category, International Private Bank has a distinct client coverage team approach with relationship and investment managers supported by client service executives assisting  clients  with  wealth  management  services  and  open-architecture  products.  In  addition,  in  Germany,  Deutsche Oppenheim Family Offices AG provides family office services, discretionary funds and advisory solutions.\n\nThe expansion of digital capabilities remains a strong focus across the businesses as a significant change in client behavior towards digital channels is observed. The Private Bank will continue to optimize the omni-channel mix in the future in order to provide customers with the most convenient access to products and services.",

The increase of \u20ac 1.9 billion, or 65% was driven by positive impacts from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other and an increase in Asset Management from valuation adjustments on guaranteed funds, which had a corresponding offset in other income. The Investment Bank benefited from the non-recurrence of prior year losses on loan commitments and hedge activities in 2023. These drivers were partly offset by decreases in the Private Bank, mainly due to lower mark-to-market impacts from hedge activities, which had a partial offsetting effect in other income, and revaluation losses in the Corporate Bank compared to gains in the prior year.\n\n## 2022\n\nNet gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were \u20ac 3.0 billion in 2022, a decrease of \u20ac 45 million compared to 2021 driven by negative impacts from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other as well as an unfavorable change in the fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offset in other income. The overall decrease was partly offset by positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in the Investment Bank driven by the ongoing heightened market activity and strong client flows as well as mark-to-market gains from hedge activities in Private Bank, which had an offsetting effect in other income.",

The bank's trading activities can periodically shift income between net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss depending on a variety of factors, including risk management strategies.\n\nIn order to provide a more business focused discussion, the following table presents net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss by corporate division.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                                                                |        |         |        | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (unless stated otherwise)                                                                                              | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  |\n| Net interest income                                                                                                    | 13,602 | 13,650  | 11,155 | (48)                                  | (0)                                   | 2,495                                 | 22                                    |\n| Total net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities  at fair value through profit or loss                         | 4,947  | 2,999   | 3,045  | 1,948                                 | 65                                    | (45)                                  | (1)                                   |\n| Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on                                                                    |        |         |        |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                                                      | 18,549 | 16,649  | 14,200 | 1,899                                 | 11                                    | 2,450                                 | 17                                    |\n| Breakdown by corporate division: 1                                                                                     |        |         |        |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Corporate Bank                                                                                                         | 5,065  | 3,720   | 2,666  | 1,344                                 | 36                                    | 1,055                                 | 40                                    |\n| Investment Bank                                                                                                        | 8,102  | 8,265   | 6,891  | (163)                                 | (2)                                   | 1,374                                 | 20                                    |\n| Private Bank                                                                                                           | 6,382  | 6,612   | 4,847  | (230)                                 | (3)                                   | 1,765                                 | 36                                    |\n| Asset Management                                                                                                       | (11)   | (250)   | 246    | 239                                   | (95)                                  | (496)                                 | N/M                                   |\n| Corporate & Other                                                                                                      | (988)  | (1,698) | (450)  | 709                                   | (42)                                  | (1,248)                               | N/M                                   |\n| Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on  financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss | 18,549 | 16,649  | 14,200 | 1,899                                 | 11                                    | 2,450                                 | 17                                    |\n\nN/M - Not meaningful\n\n## 2023\n\nTotal  net  interest  income  and  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  were \u20ac 18.5 billion in 2023, compared to \u20ac 16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of \u20ac 1.9 billion. This impact was largely attributable to an overall increase in net interest income and positive impacts from interest rate hedges. In the Corporate Bank, total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss increased by \u20ac 1.3 billion, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by an improved interest rate environment and continued pricing discipline. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in Investment Bank decreased by \u20ac 0.2 billion due to lower net interest income, partly offset by mark-to-market gains on derivatives in FIC Sales & Trading. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the Private Bank decreased by \u20ac 0.2 billion compared to prior year, driven by mark-to-market impacts from hedge activities,  with  an  offsetting  effect  in  other  income,  partly  offset  by  higher  interest  income  from  an  improved  interest  rate environment. The overall movement was supported by positive impacts in Corporate & Other amounting to approximately \u20ac 0.7 billion, including benefits from interest rate hedges, as well as in Asset Management of \u20ac 0.2 billion, mainly from a more favorable change in the fair value of guarantees.\n\n## 2022\n\nTotal  net  interest  income  and  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  were \u20ac 16.6 billion in 2022, compared to \u20ac 14.2 billion in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 2.4 billion. This was primarily due to higher net interest income driven by an improved interest rate environment and solid underlying business performance. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss increased by  \u20ac 1.8 billion in Private Bank. This impact was largely attributable to higher mark-to-market gains from hedge activities which had an offsetting effect in other income. Higher interest rates and continued business growth also had a positive impact on the year-on-year increase; these were also the main drivers for the increase in Corporate Bank by \u20ac 1.1 billion. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in Investment Bank increased by \u20ac 1.4 billion due to higher positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in FIC Sales & Trading driven by the ongoing heightened market activity  and  strong clients flows. These overall positive effects were partially offset by negative impacts of  \u20ac 1.2 billion in Corporate & Other, mainly from valuation and timing differences on derivatives and interest rate hedges, as well as in Asset Management of \u20ac 0.5 billion, mainly from a less favorable change in the fair value of guarantees.",

In particular, the Commercial Real Estate sector, and specifically the office sector, was affected by a post-COVID-19-pandemic driven change in demand and came under further pressure from interest rate increases, which led to higher refinancing risks. Provision for non-performing loans related to Stage 3 was \u20ac 1.5 billion, spread across various regions and segments, including a notable share of \u20ac 400 million related to Commercial Real Estate, especially affecting the Investment Bank. Stage 1 and Stage 2 provision for performing loans was a release of \u20ac 33 million, driven by an improved macro-economic outlook compared to 2022 and benefits from model-related changes.\n\n## 2022\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2022, up from \u20ac 515 million in 2021. The year-on-year development reflected more challenging macroeconomic conditions during most of 2022 against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 benefited from an economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Provisions were 25 basis points of average loans. Provisions for non-performing loans related to Stage 3 was \u20ac 1.0 billion, spread across regions and segments. Stage 1 and Stage 2 provision for performing loans was \u20ac 204 million, driven by deteriorating macro-economic forecasts through most of the year.\n\nThe sections 'Segment results of operations'

The decrease was driven by lower intermediary fees and transactional revenues as well as changes in contractual conditions in the Private Bank and lower fee income in the Investment Bank primarily due to lower M&A activities. In addition, the decrease was also driven  by  lower  management  fees  from  unfavorable  market  conditions  coupled  with  margin  compression  in  Asset Management.\n\n## 2022\n\nCommissions and fee income was \u20ac 9.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of \u20ac 1.1 billion or 10% compared to 2021. The decrease was driven by significantly lower Origination & Advisory revenues in Investment Bank reflecting continued challenging industry environment, lower Leveraged Debt Capital Markets revenues and a materially reduced fee pool relative to the previous year. In addition, commission and fee income in Private Bank declined reflecting a more challenging macroeconomic environment. In Asset Management performance fees were significantly lower than the previous year due to the absence of a large Multi Asset performance fee reported in 2021. These were partly offset by an increase in commissions and fee income in Corporate Bank driven by solid underlying business performance.\n\n## Net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n## 2023\n\nNet  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  were  \u20ac (0) million  in  2023  and \u20ac (216) million in 2022, with the result in the prior year driven by a sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve.\n\n## 2022\n\nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were \u20ac (216) million in 2022 and \u20ac 237 million in 2021, with the result in both periods driven by the sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve.\n\n## Net gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost\n\n## 2023\n\nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were \u20ac (96) million in 2023 compared to \u20ac (2) million in 2022, driven by realized losses on disposal of loans held in the hold to collect portfolio.\n\n## 2022\n\nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were \u20ac (2) million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 1 million in 2021, driven by the hold-to-collect portfolio.\n\n## Net income (loss) from equity method investments\n\n## 2023\n\nNet income (loss) from equity method investments was \u20ac (38) million in 2023 compared to \u20ac 152 million in 2022, a decrease of  \u20ac 190 million,  mainly  related  to  the  downward  valuation  of  the  underlying  loan  assets  in  Huarong  Rongde  Asset Management Company Limited as well as a gain on exit in 2022 which did not repeat.\n\n## 2022\n\nNet income (loss) from equity method investments was \u20ac 152 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac 98 million in 2021, an increase of \u20ac 54 million,  or  56%,  related  to  lower  impairments  in  Huarong  Rongde  Asset  Management Company Limited in 2022 as compared to 2021.\n\n## Other income (loss)\n\n## 2023\n\nOther income (loss) was \u20ac 1.3 billion in 2023 compared to \u20ac 789 million in 2022. The improvement was primarily related to gains in the hedging portfolios and the non-recurrence from gains on disposal of assets held for sale, including a gain from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim recognized in other revenues in the prior year. This was partly offset by an unfavorable impact from valuation adjustments on fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offset in net gains (losses) on financial assets/ liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## 2022\n\nOther income (loss) was \u20ac 789 million in 2022 compared to \u20ac (58) million in 2021. The improvement was driven by a favorable impact from valuation adjustments on fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offsetting effect in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, from gains on disposal of assets held for sale, including a gains from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy and from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim recognized in other revenues. This was partly offset by a decrease in income in Private Bank driven by the contra-effect of the aforementioned positive impacts in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.",

The increase was driven mainly by wage growth, an increase in external workforce as well as an increase in severance costs resulting from the accelerated execution of the banks Global Hausbank strategy.\n\n## 2022\n\nCompensation and benefits increased by \u20ac 294 million or 3% to \u20ac 10.7 billion in 2022 compared to \u20ac 10.4 billion in 2021. The increase was driven primarily by adverse foreign exchange movements, with higher salary costs.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\n## 2023\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by \u20ac 384 million or 4% to \u20ac 10.1 billion in 2023 compared to \u20ac 9.7 billion in 2022. The increase was driven by higher expenses in information technology mainly relating to increased vendor and software costs as well as higher operational taxes. This was partly offset by lower litigation expenses which decreased by \u20ac 103 million, related to a release of litigation provision and a decrease in bank levies of \u20ac 235 million.\n\n## 2022\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by \u20ac 1.1 billion or 10% to \u20ac 9.7 billion in 2022 compared to \u20ac 10.8 billion in 2021. The decrease was driven by a significant decline in transformation charges as the bank completed the transformation initiatives announced in 2019. Further reductions were across major cost categories, reflecting the bank's continued cost reduction efforts. Litigation expenses decreased by \u20ac 53 million, partly related to a provision release related to the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing arrangements. The declines were partly offset by a year-on-year rise in bank levies of \u20ac 210 million.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\n## 2023\n\nImpairment  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  was  \u20ac 233 million  relating  to  the  impaired  goodwill  of  Numis  in  the Investment  Bank  in  2023,  compared  to  \u20ac 68 million  relating  to  a  historic  acquisition  of  an  unamortized  intangible  asset associated with U.S. mutual fund retail contracts in Asset Management in 2022.\n\n## 2022\n\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was \u20ac 68 million in 2022, relating to the aforementioned historic acquisition in Asset Management, compared to \u20ac 5 million in the Corporate Bank in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Restructuring\n\n## 2023\n\nRestructuring activities were charges of \u20ac 220 million in 2023 compared to a release of \u20ac (118) million in 2022. The charges were driven primarily by Private Bank in the context of the execution of strategic initiatives.\n\n## 2022\n\nRestructuring  activities  were  a  release  of  \u20ac (118) million  in  2022  compared  to  charges  of  \u20ac 261 million  in  2021.  The development in both periods was driven primarily by Private Bank in the context of the execution of strategic objectives.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\n## 2023\n\nIncome tax expense was \u20ac 787 million in 2023, compared to an income tax benefit of \u20ac 64 million in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2023 of 14% benefited from positive year end deferred tax asset valuation adjustments of \u20ac 1.0 billion, largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK.\n\n## 2022\n\nIncome tax benefit in 2022 was \u20ac 64 million compared to an income tax expense of \u20ac 880 million in 2021. The effective tax rate in 2022 of (1)% benefited from a positive year end deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion, reflecting continued strong performance in Deutsche Bank's U.S. operations.\n\n## Net profit (loss)\n\n## 2023\n\nNet profit in 2023 was \u20ac 4.9 billion, compared to \u20ac 5.7 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net profit was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in income tax expense compared to 2022, including the aforementioned year end deferred tax asset valuation adjustments.\n\n## 2022\n\nNet profit in 2022 was \u20ac 5.7 billion, compared to \u20ac 2.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in net profit was primarily driven by strong revenue performance across core businesses, reduced noninterest expenses and the aforementioned tax benefit from a year end deferred tax asset valuation adjustment. Partly offsetting was an increase in provision for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## 2023\n\nProfit before tax of the Corporate Bank was \u20ac 3.0 billion for the full year 2023, up from \u20ac 1.8 billion in 2022, driven by higher revenues and lower provision for credit losses,  partly  offset  by  higher  noninterest  expenses.  Post-tax  return  on  average shareholders' equity was 15.2%, up from 10.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 16.6%, up from 10.9% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 58%, down from 66% in 2022.\n\nFull year net revenues were \u20ac 7.7 billion, 22% higher year on year, driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing discipline, while commission and fee income remained essentially flat. Deposit volume remained essentially flat, while loan volume  lowered  by  \u20ac 5 billion,  or  4%,  due  to  a  more  selective  balance  sheet  deployment  and  negative  impact  from FX movements.\n\nAll  of  the  Corporate  Bank's  businesses  contributed  to  revenue  growth.  Corporate  Treasury  Services  net  revenues  were \u20ac 4.4 billion, up 14% year on year, driven by increased interest rates coupled with essentially flat deposit volume. Institutional Client Services net revenues were \u20ac 1.9 billion, 20% higher year on year, benefitting from higher interest rates and higher deposit volume. Business Banking net revenues were \u20ac 1.4 billion, 55% higher year on year, reflecting higher interest rate and lagging deposit payouts in Germany supported by essentially flat business volumes.\n\nProvision  for  credit  losses  in  2023  was  \u20ac 266 million,  or  23  basis  points  of  average  loans,  compared  to  provisions  of \u20ac 335 million, or 27 basis points of average loans, in 2022. The reduction reflects releases of Stage 1 and 2 provisions driven by improved macroeconomic outlook and model changes.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 4.5 billion, up 7% year on year, mainly due to increased nonoperating costs, internal service cost allocations and noncompensation direct costs.\n\n## 2022\n\nProfit before tax of the Corporate Bank was \u20ac 1.8 billion for the full year 2022, up from \u20ac 0.6 billion in 2021, driven by higher revenues and lower noninterest expenses, partly offset by increased provision for credit losses. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 10.0%, up from 3.2% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 10.9%, up from 3.5% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 66%, down from 88% in 2021.\n\nFull year net revenues were \u20ac 6.3 billion, 23% higher year on year. Revenue growth was driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing discipline, higher commission and fee income as well as deposit growth and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Deposits grew by \u20ac 18 billion, or 7%, during the year while loan volume decreased by \u20ac 1 billion, or 1%.\n\nAll  of  the  Corporate  Bank's  businesses  contributed  to  revenue  growth.  Corporate  Treasury  Services  net  revenues  were \u20ac 3.8 billion, up 24% year on year, driven by increased interest rates across all markets, growth in commission and fee income and higher deposits. Institutional Client Services net revenues were \u20ac 1.6 billion, 22% higher year on year, benefitting from higher interest rates and favorable foreign exchange movements. Business Banking net revenues were \u20ac 930 million, 19% higher year on year, reflecting transition to a positive interest rate environment in Germany in the second half of 2022 and higher commission and fee income from account repricing.\n\nProvision  for  credit  losses  was  \u20ac 335 million  in  the  year,  or  27  basis  points  of  average  loans,  reflecting  the  weakened macroeconomic environment, from essentially nil in the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 4.2 billion, down 8% year on year, as a positive contribution from noncompensation initiatives and lower nonoperating costs were partly offset by foreign exchange rate movements.",

shareholders' equity of the segments, the Group effective tax rate was adjusted to exclude the impact of permanent differences not attributed to the segments, so that the segment tax rates were 28% for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021; for further information, please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this Annual Report\n\n## 2023\n\nProfit before tax in 2023 was \u20ac 1.8 billion, down \u20ac 1.4 billion, or 43% compared to 2022. This reflects a decline of profit before tax in FIC Sales & Trading revenues compared to a very strong prior year, higher costs driven by strategic investments into the  business,  including  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  and  increased  Provision  for  credit  losses.  Post-tax  return  on  average shareholders' equity was 3.8%, down from 8.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 4.0%, down from 8.4% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio in 2023 was 75%, compared to 65% in 2022.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 9.2 billion, a decrease of \u20ac 856 million, or 9% year on year.\n\nRevenues in FIC Sales & Trading were \u20ac 8.0 billion, down \u20ac 961 million, or 11% compared to 2022, which was the best FIC revenue performance in a decade. Revenues in Rates, Emerging Markets and Foreign Exchange were all significantly lower, reflecting reduced levels of market volatility and activity. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher due to the improved performance of Credit Flow following investments into the business. Financing revenues were robust and essentially flat to the prior year.",

        "page_content": "Origination & Advisory revenues were \u20ac 1.2 billion, an increase of \u20ac 249 million, or 25% year on year. This was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of material leveraged lending markdowns in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Investment Grade debt revenues were lower, reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic). Advisory revenues were significantly lower due to reduced levels of announced deals coming into 2023. Equity Origination revenues were essentially flat to the prior year.\n\nOther  revenues  were  negative  \u20ac 60 million,  compared  to  positive  \u20ac 84 million  in  2022.  The  year-on-year  decrease  was materially driven by a loss of \u20ac 47 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments on certain derivative liabilities versus a gain of \u20ac 49 million in the prior year.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 431 million, or 42 basis points of average loans, an increase of \u20ac 112 million year on year due to increased levels of stage 3 impairments, primarily in relation to Commercial Real Estate.\n\nNoninterest expenses in 2023 were \u20ac 6.9 billion, an increase of \u20ac 424 million or 7% year on year, primarily driven by an impairment of Goodwill due to the Numis acquisition, as well as strategic investments made across the business and in line with the previously communicated strategy.\n\n## 2022\n\nProfit before tax was \u20ac 3.2 billion in 2022, a decrease of \u20ac 241 million versus a very strong prior year. Slightly higher revenues were more than offset by significantly higher provision for credit losses and slightly higher noninterest expenses. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 8.0%, down from 9.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 8.4%, down from 9.4% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio in 2022 was 65%, compared to 63% in 2021.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 10.0 billion in 2022, an increase of \u20ac 385 million, or 4% compared to 2021.\n\nRevenues in FIC Sales & Trading were \u20ac 8.9 billion, an increase of \u20ac 1.9 billion, or 26%, versus the prior year, with strong year on year growth across the majority of the franchise. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all significantly higher, reflecting heightened levels of market activity, increased client flows and disciplined risk management. Financing revenues were higher, driven primarily by higher net interest income, as a result of increased lending activity. Revenues  in  Credit  Trading  were  significantly  lower  due  to  the  non-recurrence  of  the  contribution  from  a  concentrated distressed credit position in the prior year and a challenging market environment.\n\nOrigination & Advisory net revenues were \u20ac 1.0 billion, a decrease of \u20ac 1.6 billion, or 62%, compared to the prior year. Debt Origination revenues were \u20ac 412 million, significantly lower than the prior year driven principally by Leveraged Debt Capital Markets, where revenues were impacted by a material decline in the industry fee pool and loan markdowns, which were seen across the industry. Investment Grade debt revenues were also lower, however decreased by less than the industry average (source: Dealogic). Equity Origination revenues of \u20ac 101 million were significantly lower, reflecting a material decline in primary equity issuance during the year. Advisory revenues of \u20ac 485 million were essentially flat to 2021, in a fee pool that was down approximately 15% (source: Dealogic).\n\nOther  revenues  were  positive  \u20ac 84 million,  compared  to  negative  \u20ac 40 million  in  2021.  The  year-on-year  increase  was materially driven by a gain of \u20ac 49 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments on certain derivative liabilities versus a loss of  \u20ac 28 million  in  2021.  Additionally,  2021  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  reversal  of  previously  recorded Collateralized Loan Obligation hedge gains, which had resulted from the release of underlying provision for credit losses. These did not re-occur in 2022.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 319 million, or 32 basis points of average loans, an increase of \u20ac 215 million versus prior year, primarily driven by a weakened macroeconomic environment whilst the prior year benefited from a  post COVID-19 recovery.\n\nNoninterest expenses in 2022 were \u20ac 6.5 billion, an increase of \u20ac 379 million or 6% compared to prior year, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange translation and increased bank levies.",

Group defines assets under management as (a) assets held on behalf of customers for investment purposes and/or (b) client assets that are managed by the bank; assets under management are managed on a discretionary or advisory basis, or these assets are deposited with the bank; deposits are considered assets under management if they serve  investment  purposes;  in  the  Private  Bank  Germany  and  Premium  Banking,  this  includes  term  deposits  and  savings  deposits;  in  Wealth  Management  &  Bank  for Entrepreneurs, it is assumed that all customer deposits are held with the bank primarily for investment purposes; in instances in which Private Bank distributes investment products qualifying as assets under management which are managed by DWS these are reported as assets under management for Private Bank and for Asset Management (DWS) because they are two distinct, independent qualifying services\n- 4 Noninterest expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, which are defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses plus noninterest income\n- 5 For the post-tax return on average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity of the segments, the Group effective tax rate was adjusted to exclude the impact of permanent differences not attributed to the segments, so that the segment tax rates were 28% for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021; for further information, please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this Annual Report",

Nonoperating  costs  were \u20ac 468 million in 2023, compared to a benefit of \u20ac 147 million in 2022. Furthermore, 2022 revenues included \u20ac 430 million in specific items which did not recur in 2023. These items impacted key ratios, with the cost/income ratio rising to 81%, from 75% in the prior year, while post-tax return on average shareholders' equity declined to 4.1%, from 8.3% in 2022 and post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity declined to 4.5%, from 9.0% in the prior year. Excluding nonoperating cost and specific revenue items, profit before tax would have been up 30% year on year.\n\nNet revenues were \u20ac 9.6 billion, up 5% year on year, or up 10% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of the aforementioned \u20ac 430 million  of  specific  items  from  last  year.  These  included  a  gain  of  approximately  \u20ac 310 million  from  the  sale  of  the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, and positive impacts from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue growth was driven by higher net interest income from deposit products, partly offset by lower fee income and lower loan revenues in a rising interest  rate  environment.  The  Private  Bank  attracted  net  inflows  into  assets  under  management  of \u20ac 29 billion  in  2023,  with  net  inflows  in  both  investment  products  and  deposits.  Loan  development  reflected  lower  client demand, mainly in mortgage loans in Germany and client deleveraging in APAC.\n\nIn Private Bank Germany, net revenues grew by 14% to \u20ac 6.1 billion as higher net interest income from deposit products more than offset impacts from lower fee income due to changes in contractual and regulatory conditions.\n\nIn  the  International  Private  Bank,  net  revenues  were  \u20ac 3.5 billion,  down  8%  year  on  year,  or  up  5%  if  adjusted  for  the aforementioned impact of specific items, from non-recurring revenues of approximately \u20ac 50 million following the business divestiture in Italy. Higher deposit revenues were offset by lower loan and investment revenues mainly in the APAC region.\n\nAssets under management in the Private Bank were \u20ac 559 billion at year end, up \u20ac 40 billion in the year. The increase was mainly driven by net inflows of \u20ac 29 billion and by a \u20ac 19 billion beneficial impact from higher market levels partly offset by \u20ac 4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 783 million, or 30 basis points of average loans, compared to \u20ac 583 million, or 22 basis points of average loans in the prior year. The increase mainly reflected a more difficult macroeconomic environment, higher impacts of single name losses in the International Private Bank and effects from temporary operational backlog related to the Postbank IT migration, while provision for credit losses in 2022 benefited from releases following sales of non-performing loans. The development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book, especially in the retail businesses, and ongoing tight risk discipline.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 7.8 billion, up 14% year on year, driven predominantly by the aforementioned \u20ac 468 million in nonoperating costs, including restructuring and severance of \u20ac 346 million and litigation charges of \u20ac 123 million, compared to releases of nonoperating costs of \u20ac 147 million in 2022. Adjusted costs, which exclude these items, were up 4%, mainly reflecting  investments  in  Group  control  functions,  strategic  initiatives,  higher  internal  cost  allocations,  Postbank  service remediation  and  inflation  impacts.  These  were  partly  mitigated  by  continued  savings  from  transformation  programs  and reduced regulatory charges.",

        "page_content": "## 2022\n\nPrivate Bank recorded a profit before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion in 2022 compared to a loss of \u20ac 133 million in the prior year, the highest profit before tax since the formation of Private Bank in 2019. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 8.3%, up from negative 1.5% in 2021, with post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity rose to 9.0%, up from negative 1.7% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio improved to 75%, down from 96% in the prior year, reflecting growth of 11% in revenues combined with a reduction of 14% in noninterest expenses.\n\nNet revenues grew to \u20ac 9.2 billion, up 11% year on year. The increase partly reflected higher specific revenue items, mainly a gain of approximately \u20ac 310 million from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as the positive impact of reduced forgone revenues related to the 2021 German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing agreements. Adjusted for these impacts, net revenues grew by 6% year on year, driven by higher net interest income, foreign exchange rate movements and continued business growth. Business growth was \u20ac 41 billion in 2022 and reflected net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac 30 billion, including net inflows into investment products of \u20ac 25 billion and deposits of \u20ac 5 billion, as well as net new client loans of \u20ac 11 billion.\n\nPrivate Bank Germany generated net revenues of \u20ac 5.3 billion, up 6% year on year, partly reflecting the reduction in forgone revenues from the BGH ruling. Adjusted for this impact, revenues were up 4% as higher net interest income from deposit products  more  than  offset  the  impacts  of  lower  loan  revenues  and  fee  income  in  a  more  challenging  macro-economic environment.\n\nIn  International  Private  Bank,  net  revenues  were  \u20ac 3.8 billion,  up  19%  year  on  year,  and  up  9%  if  adjusted  for  the aforementioned gain on sale, and for Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue growth was mainly attributable to higher deposit  revenues  due  to  interest  rate  increases,  continued  loan  book  expansion  and  positive  foreign  exchange  rate movements. Revenues from investment products benefitted from net inflows but were also impacted by a more challenging market environment. International Private Bank attracted net new volumes of  \u20ac 29 billion across loans and assets under management in the full year, the highest since its formation.\n\nAssets under management in Private Bank declined by \u20ac 36 billion to \u20ac 518 billion at year end. This development reflected \u20ac 56 billion in negative impacts from market developments and a \u20ac 15 billion disposal net effect after the sale of the Financial Advisors business in Italy, partly offset by \u20ac 30 billion net inflows and a \u20ac 6 billion positive impact from foreign exchange rate movements.\n\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 583 million, or 22 basis points of average loans, partly driven by certain single exposures in the international franchise. Excluding these, the development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book and ongoing tight risk discipline. This compares to \u20ac 446 million provision for credit losses in the prior year, which benefitted from a more stable macroeconomic environment.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 6.8 billion, a reduction of 14% year on year. This development reflected a positive impact from the release of litigation provisions recorded in the prior year related to the BGH ruling, lower restructuring expenses in the context of the execution of strategic objectives and a year-on-year reduction in adjusted costs of 7%. The latter was driven by incremental savings from transformation initiatives including workforce reductions and the closure of more than 170 branches. Ongoing cost management and lower internal service cost allocations also contributed to the reduction in adjusted costs. These effects were partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements.",

Noninterest expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, which are defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses plus noninterest income\n\n## 2023\n\nProfit before tax was \u20ac 396 million, down 32%, mainly driven by lower revenues. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 4.9%, down from 7.4% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 11.3%, down from 17.1% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 77%, up from 71% in 2022.\n\nNet revenues in 2023 were \u20ac 2.4 billion, down 9% compared to 2022, resulting from significantly lower other revenues driven by higher funding costs and lower investment income, as well as slightly lower management fees due to negative market developments,  the  composition  of  the  net  inflows  in  Alternatives  and  margin  compression  in  other  product  classes. Performance and transaction fees were essentially flat compared to full year 2022.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.8 billion in 2023, down 1%. Adjusted costs increased by 3%, mainly due to higher IT costs to support  transformation  and  higher  banking  servicing  costs  driven  by  a  rise  in  assets  under  management  in  the  Passive business, while compensation and benefits remained essentially flat. Non-operating costs were significantly lower due to a \u20ac 68 million impairment of an unamortized intangible asset related to U.S. mutual fund retail contracts in the prior year.\n\nNet flows were positive \u20ac 28 billion, primarily in Passive, Cash and Multi Assets products. This was partly offset by net outflows in Equity and Systematic & Quantitative Investments (SQI), while net flows in Alternatives and Fixed Income being essentially flat. ESG products attracted net inflows of \u20ac 5 billion in 2023 primarily into Xtrackers.\n\nAssets under Management increased by \u20ac 75 billion, or 9%, to \u20ac 896 billion during 2023, mainly driven by positive market developments and net inflows, while foreign exchange rate movements had a negative impact.",

Adjusted for restructuring and severance expenses and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, profit before tax was \u20ac 689 million, down 17%. Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity was 7.4%, down from 11.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 17.1%, down from 25.8% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 71%, up from 62% in 2021.\n\nNet revenues for 2022 were \u20ac 2.6 billion, down 4%, as higher management fees were more than offset by significantly lower performance fees, reflecting the non-recurrence of a performance fee of \u20ac 89 million from an Active Asset fund recognized in 2021, and significantly lower other revenues.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.8 billion in 2022, up 11%. Adjusted costs increased by 5%, mainly due to higher compensation and benefits driven by a rise in headcount to support transformation and growth. Non-operating costs include a \u20ac 68 million impairment of an unamortized intangible asset related to U.S. mutual fund retail contracts. The cost/income ratio was 71%, up 9 percentage points compared to the prior year.\n\nNet flows were negative \u20ac 20 billion, primarily in lower margin products Fixed Income, Cash and Passive, impacted by industrywide pressure on flows. This was partly offset by net inflows in higher-margin products Multi Asset and Alternatives. ESG products attracted net inflows of \u20ac 1 billion in 2022 despite the adverse environment.\n\nAssets under Management decreased by \u20ac 106 billion, or 11%, to \u20ac 821 billion during 2022, mainly driven by negative market developments and net outflows, while foreign exchange rate movements had a positive impact.\n\nThe following table provides the development of assets under management during 2022, broken down by product type as well as the respective management fee margins:\n\n| in \u20ac bn.                        | Active  Equity   | Active  Fixed  Income   | Active  Multi  Asset   | Active  SQI   | Active  Cash   | Passive   | Alternatives   | Assets under  management   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 | 116              | 227                     | 70                     | 77            | 84             | 238       | 115            | 928                        |\n| Inflows                         | 16               | 39                      | 16                     | 10            | 562            | 81        | 17             | 741                        |\n| Outflows                        | (17)             | (51)                    | (10)                   | (11)          | (568)          | (88)      | (16)           | (761)                      |\n| Net Flows                       | (1)              | (12)                    | 6                      | (0)           | (6)            | (7)       | 1              | (20)                       |\n| FX impact                       | 2                | 7                       | 0                      | 0             | 2              | 7         | 4              | 22                         |\n| Performance                     | (18)             | (28)                    | (8)                    | (13)          | 0              | (38)      | (2)            | (108)                      |\n| Other                           | (0)              | 1                       | 0                      | (0)           | (0)            | (1)       | 0              | 0                          |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022 | 99               | 194                     | 68                     | 64            | 80             | 199       | 118            | 821                        |\n| Management fee margin (in bps)  | 71               | 12                      | 31                     | 29            | 3              | 18        | 50             | 28                         |",

Revenues related to valuation and timing differences were positive \u20ac 792 million in 2023, compared to negative \u20ac 119 million in 2022, the year-on-year improvement driven by market moves and the reversion of prior period losses. Net revenues relating to funding and liquidity were negative \u20ac 242 million in 2023, versus negative \u20ac 311 million in 2022.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 738 million in 2023, a reduction of \u20ac 299 million, or 29%, compared to 2022. The reduction was primarily driven by positive \u20ac 37 million litigation releases in 2023, compared to a charge of \u20ac 261 million in 2022. Expenses associated  with  shareholder  activities  as  defined  in  the  OECD  Transfer  Pricing  guidelines  not  allocated  to  the  business divisions were \u20ac 582 million in 2023, versus \u20ac 510 million in 2022.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are deducted from the profit before tax of the divisions and reversed in Corporate & Other. These amounted to \u20ac 166 million in 2023, compared to \u20ac 190 million in 2022, mainly related to DWS.\n\n## 2022\n\nCorporate & Other reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion in 2022 compared to a loss before tax of \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2021, primarily reflecting higher negative net revenues.\n\nNet revenues were negative \u20ac 904 million in 2022, compared to negative \u20ac 314 million in 2021. Revenues related to valuation and timing differences were negative \u20ac 119 million in 2022, compared to positive \u20ac 158 million in 2021. Net revenues relating to funding and liquidity were negative \u20ac 311 million in 2022, versus negative \u20ac 242 million in 2021.\n\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 1.0 billion in 2022, compared to \u20ac 1.3 billion in 2021, a reduction of 19% year on year. This reduction  was  primarily  driven  by  legacy  portfolios,  reflecting  lower  internal  service  charges  and  a  decline  in  direct compensation and noncompensation costs. Expenses associated with shareholder activities as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines not allocated to the business divisions were \u20ac 510 million in 2022, versus \u20ac 460 million in 2021.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are deducted from the profit before tax of the divisions and reversed in Corporate & Other. These amounted to \u20ac 190 million in 2022, compared to \u20ac 206 million in 2021, mainly related to DWS.",

Corresponding liabilities decreased by \u20ac 6.6 billion, primarily driven by decreased short positions in government bonds in Europe rates business.\n\nPositive  and  negative  market  values  of  derivative  financial  instruments  decreased  by  \u20ac 47.8 billion  and  \u20ac 44.1 billion, respectively, driven by foreign exchange products primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and derisking. The decline was also observed in interest rate products due to moves in interest rate curves.\n\nLoans at amortized cost decreased by \u20ac 10.0 billion, primarily driven by lower demand and continued selective balance sheet deployment in the Corporate Bank as well as lower mortgage origination in the Private Bank.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased by \u20ac 29.1 billion, mainly attributable to an increase in  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  as  a  result  of  increased  secured  funding  of  trading  inventory  and  client activities; as well as an increase in long term debt driven by new issuances in FIC business in the Investment Bank.\n\nOther short-term borrowings increased by \u20ac 4.5 billion, mainly driven by newly issued commercial paper.\n\nLong term debt at amortized cost decreased by \u20ac 12.1 billion as a result of prepayment of TLTRO and matured issuances, which were partly offset by new issuances during the year.\n\nThe overall movement of the balance sheet included a decrease of \u20ac 18.6 billion due to foreign exchange rate movements, mainly driven by a weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are embedded in the movement of the balance sheet line items discussed in this section.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity\n\nTotal High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) as defined by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and amended by Regulation (EU) 2018/1620 remained flat at  \u20ac 219 billion  for  both  December  31,  2023,  and  December  31,  2022.  This  is primarily due to the repayment of TLTRO liabilities offset by business portfolio movements. The Group maintains additional highly liquid central bank eligible assets, not qualifying as HQLA or subject to transfer restrictions under the HQLA definition. These additional liquid assets were \u20ac 42 billion, such that the Group's total Liquidity Reserves were \u20ac 261 billion as at the end of December 31, 2023. As at the end of December 31, 2022, these additional liquid assets were \u20ac 37 billion, such that the Group's total Liquidity Reserves were \u20ac 256 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 140% at the end fourth quarter of 2023, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 62 billion as compared to 142% as at the end of fourth quarter of 2022, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 64 billion.\n\n## Equity\n\nTotal equity as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac 74.8 billion compared to \u20ac 72.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of \u20ac 2.5 billion. This change was driven by a number of factors including the profit attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders and additional equity components reported for the period of \u20ac 4.8 billion and treasury shares distributed under share-based compensation  plans  of  \u20ac 407 million.  Further  contributing  factors  include  unrealized  net  gains  on  accumulated  other comprehensive income, mainly on derivatives hedging cash flows of \u20ac 592 million, net of tax, as well as attributable to financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of \u20ac 133 million, net of tax. These were partially offset by negative impacts from foreign currency translation of \u20ac 1.1 billion, net of tax, primarily resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against  the  Euro,  net  purchases  of  treasury  shares  of  \u20ac 857 million,  coupons  paid  on  additional  equity  components  of \u20ac 498 million as well as cash dividends paid to Deutsche Bank shareholders of \u20ac 610 million. Further contributing factors include remeasurement losses related to defined benefit plans of \u20ac 148 million, net of tax, a net change in share awards for the period of \u20ac 94 million and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of \u20ac 100 million.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, Deutsche Bank cancelled 26.5 million of its common shares, concluding its 2022 share buyback program. The cancellation reduced the nominal value of the shares by \u20ac 68 million. The cancelled shares had been held in common shares in treasury, at their acquisition cost of \u20ac 300 million. The difference between the common shares at cost and their nominal value has reduced additional paid-in capital by \u20ac 232 million. The shares had already been deducted from the reported total equity on December 31, 2022. Therefore, the cancellation did not reduce the reported total equity in 2023.\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG decided to initiate the 2023 share buyback program of up to \u20ac 450 million. The share buyback program started on August 2, 2023 and ended on December 8, 2023. In this period Deutsche Bank repurchased 45.5 million common shares. The repurchase of these shares has reduced the reported total equity by \u20ac 450 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Own Funds\n\nDeutsche Bank's CRR/CRD Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023 remains materially flat at \u20ac 48.1 billion, compared  to  December  31,  2022.  The  Risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  decreased  by  \u20ac 10.3 billion  to  \u20ac 349.7 billion  as  of December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac 360.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The CET 1 capital ratio increased to 13.7% on December 31, 2023, from 13.4% on December 31, 2022, as a result of a decrease in RWA.\n\nThe Bank's Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023, amounted to \u20ac 56.4 billion, consisting of a CET 1 capital of \u20ac 48.1 billion and Additional Tier 1 capital of \u20ac 8.3 billion. The Tier 1 capital was \u20ac 0.2 billion lower than at the end of 2022, driven by a decrease in AT1 capital. The Tier 1 capital ratio as of December 31, 2023, increased to 16.1% compared to 15.7% as of December 31, 2022.\n\nTotal capital as of December 31, 2023 amounted to \u20ac 65.0 billion compared to \u20ac 66.1 billion at the end of 2022. The Total capital decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 capital of \u20ac 0.2 billion and a decrease in Tier 2 capital of \u20ac 0.9 billion since year end 2022. The Total capital ratio as of December 31, 2023, increased to 18.6% compared to 18.4% as of December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the bank's liquidity risk management, please see the Risk Report in this annual report.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nDeutsche Bank is rated by Moody's France SAS ('Moody's'), S&P Global Ratings UK Limited ('S&P'), Fitch Ratings, a branch of Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited ('Fitch'), and DBRS Ratings GmbH ('Morningstar DBRS', together with Moody's, S&P and Fitch, the 'rating agencies').\n\nMoody's, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS are established in the European Union and have been registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009, as amended, on credit rating agencies ('CRA Regulation'). With respect to S&P, the credit ratings are endorsed by S&P's office in Ireland (S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited) in accordance with Article 4(3) of the CRA Regulation.\n\n## Credit Ratings Development\n\nThe rating agencies recognized the continued progress the bank has made over the course of 2023, specifically further improvements in profitability. This was reflected in upgrades by S&P, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS during the year.\n\nOn May 17, 2023, S&P revised its outlook on Deutsche Bank's long-term Issuer Credit Rating to positive from stable. S&P reflected the bank's strengthening resilience and performance. In their view, Deutsche Bank's transformation program has established a more focused and profitable business model and laid the foundations for further progress. In addition, S&P pointed to the bank's solid capital, funding, and liquidity profiles underpinning its credit profile and mitigating market volatility.\n\nOn June 29, 2023, Morningstar DBRS upgraded Deutsche Bank's long-term ratings by one notch. The bank's long-term deposit and long-term senior debt ratings as well as the Issuer Rating and the Intrinsic Assessment have been upgraded to A from A (low). In addition, the bank's senior non-preferred debt ratings were raised to A (low) from BBB (high) as well as its Critical Obligations Rating to AA (low) from A (high). The outlook on all long-term ratings has been changed to stable from positive. Morningstar DBRS highlighted the successful implementation of the strategic transformation program, which has helped stabilize and grow Deutsche Bank's franchise, together with improved profitability. At the same time, the bank has maintained a conservative risk profile and solid capital ratios, in their view. Given the business momentum, the ongoing repricing of its loan portfolio to higher rates and the cost controls implemented, Morningstar DBRS expects Deutsche Bank to be able to maintain profitability levels in line with its rating.\n\nOn July 3, 2023, Fitch upgraded Deutsche Bank's long-term ratings by one notch. The bank's long-term deposit and longterm senior preferred debt ratings as well as the Derivative Counterparty Rating have been upgraded to A from A-. In addition, the bank's Issuer Default Rating and senior non-preferred debt ratings were raised to A- from BBB+. The ratings for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt were upgraded to BB+ from BB and to BBB from BBB-, respectively. The short-term ratings for deposits and senior preferred debt were raised to F1 from F2, respectively. The outlook on the long-term Issuer Default Rating has been changed to stable from positive. Fitch highlighted the completion of most of its restructuring as well as Deutsche Bank's more stable and diversified business model. In addition, the bank's sound risk appetite, asset quality, funding and liquidity also support the ratings, in their view.\n\nFollowing the outlook revision to positive in May, S&P upgraded Deutsche Bank's long-term and short-term ratings by one notch on December 8, 2023. The bank's long-term Issuer Credit Rating and the long-term senior preferred debt rating have been upgraded to A from A-, while the senior non-preferred debt rating has been increased to BBB from BBB-. In addition, the ratings for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt have been upgraded to BBB- from BB+ and to BB from BB-, respectively. The short-term Issuer Credit Rating was raised to A-1 from A-2. The outlook on the long-term Issuer Credit Rating has been changed to stable from positive. S&P highlighted Deutsche Bank's strengthened performance and resilience as key drivers of the upgrade, while they also believe the bank's capitalization is supportive to the ratings.",

        "page_content": "## Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates both the contractual and hypothetical potential impact of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade by the rating agencies (Moody's, S&P and Fitch) on its liquidity position and includes this impact in its daily liquidity stress test and Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculations. The LCR and liquidity stress test results by scenario are disclosed separately.\n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, the hypothetical impact on derivative liquidity stress outflows of a one-notch downgrade across the three rating agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch amounts to approximately \u20ac 0.4 billion, mainly driven by increased contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements. The hypothetical impact of a two-notch downgrade amounts to approximately \u20ac 0.5 billion, mainly driven by increased contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements.\n\nThe above analysis assumes a simultaneous downgrade by the three rating agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch that would consequently reduce Deutsche Bank's funding capacity in the stated amounts.

        "page_content": "## Banking industry\n\nThe global banking industry will probably face more headwinds in 2024 than in the past year when the operating environment had been quite benign. Interest rates are likely to have peaked in major economies and could start to fall from spring onwards. This may exert pressure on net interest margins in the medium term despite a potential short-term benefit from lower funding cost. Asset quality might deteriorate somewhat from current levels as significantly higher interest rates continue to creep into the private sector and stretched borrowers face increasing refinancing risks, especially in the commercial real estate markets. At the same time, a slow real economy in advanced countries may result in credit demand of companies and households weakening further until it stabilizes over the course of the year; with loan volumes possibly moderately contracting. Momentum in capital markets could see a cyclical improvement following two years of suppressed activity.\n\nEuropean banks may continue to benefit from substantially higher interest rates, although the associated side effects will gain in weight. As a result of considerable uncertainty about the speed and extent of the disinflation process, timing and size of the ECB's initial rate cuts is also subject to changing expectations. Likewise, fiscal and economic policy uncertainty may increase due to the incoming new European Commission and European Parliament, on top of developments in individual EU member states  and  looming  further  geopolitical  fragmentation.  However,  the  banking  industry  should  continue  to  operate  from  a position of strength, with revenues still strong despite slower growth and bottom-line profitability likely to remain close to current record high levels. Capital ratios might edge up slightly, while the specific impact of the implementation of the Final Basel III reforms in the EU should become clear. However additional improvements in profitability and capital may become harder to achieve.\n\nIn the US, the economy may continue to expand robustly in 2024, which may support loan growth. While the Fed is likely to proceed more slowly in cutting interest rates than the ECB, lower rates could nevertheless help ease the burden of unrealized securities losses on banks' balance sheets. Similar to Europe, policy uncertainty could increase ahead of US elections in November. But greater clarity is emerging regarding the implementation of the Final Basel III reforms and specifically the tighter requirements regional banks will face as a consequence of the turmoil in March 2023. This could slow their growth and make building  up  capital  as  well  as  strengthening  liquidity  a  priority.  Nevertheless,  system-wide  profitability  should  stay elevated.\n\nBanks in China and Japan may continue to experience headwinds from lackluster economic growth and low, respectively zero, interest rates, even though a first rate hike in Japan is expected in spring. Chinese banks in particular are likely to be affected by the ongoing crisis in the domestic real estate market. Nevertheless, exact repercussions are difficult to predict given the strong role the authorities might potentially play in resolving any issues.\n\nIn 2024, the European Commission, European Parliament and the European member states will focus on closing as many of the pending legislative files as possible, ahead of the elections of the European Parliament in June 2024 and the appointment of the new European Commission in October 2024. Files that are open include the Listings Act, Retail Investment Strategy, the  digital  euro,  open  finance,  Corporate  Sustainability  Due  Diligence  Directive,  the  review  of  the  Payment  Services framework,  the  review  of  the  European  Markets  Infrastructure  framework  (EMIR  3.0),  Benchmarks  Regulation,  and  the extension for third-country benchmarks from the EU Benchmarks Regulation to December 2025.\n\nIn the U.S., most of the attention is on the proposal from the U.S. agencies to implement the Final Basel III package in the U.S. framework. The proposal raises capital requirements for banks over U.S.$ 100 billion in assets and removes much of the differentiation among institutions' requirements, those that are not U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks, based on size and complexity.",

If Deutsche Bank continues to refine and accelerate the bank's Global Hausbank strategy with measures it successfully implements, the bank could outperform its 2025 financial targets.\n\nDeutsche Bank's key performance indicators are shown in the table below.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n| Financial targets                                               | Dec 31, 2023   | Financial targets  and capital  objectives  2025   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Post-tax return on average tangible equity 1                    | 7.4%           | Above 10.0%                                        |\n| Compound annual growth rate of revenues between 2021 and 2025 2 | 6.6%           | 5.5 to 6.5% 3                                      |\n| Cost/income ratio 4                                             | 75.1%          | 62.5%                                              |\n| Capital objectives                                              |                |                                                    |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 5                            | 13.7%          | ~ 13.0% 6                                          |\n| Total payout ratio 7                                            | 21%            | 50% 8                                              |\n\n5\n\nFurther details on the calculation of this ratio are provided in the Risk Report in this report\n\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets to be achieved by 2025 of a post-tax return on average tangible equity of above 10% and increases the bank's target on compound annual revenue growth of between 5.5% and 6.5% for 2021 to 2025, from its previously announced 3.5 to 4.5% target, along with a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank also confirms its capital objectives of a CET 1 capital ratio of around 13% and a payout ratio of 50% in respect of the financial year 2024 onwards. All forward-looking projections below are based on January 31, 2024, foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to the prior year. Deutsche Bank expects revenues to be at around \u20ac 30 billion at Group level supported by the resilience and growth potential of its businesses and continued business momentum. Corporate Bank revenues are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 driven by an continued normalization of net interest margins. Investment Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2024 driven by significantly higher revenues in Origination & Advisory mainly from an expected recovery in the Debt Origination business and slightly higher revenues in FIC Sales & Trading. Private Bank net revenues are expected to remain essentially flat, benefiting from the business growth in investment products, which are partially offset by lower deposit revenues given a more competitive environment. In Asset Management, revenues are expected to be slightly higher assuming market stabilization.\n\nDeutsche Bank is managing the Group's cost base towards the 2025 cost/income ratio target. The bank remains highly focused on cost discipline and delivery of the initiatives underway and expects noninterest expenses as well as adjusted costs in 2024 to be essentially flat compared to 2023. The Group believes costs in 2024 to benefit from the bank's investment in structural  efficiency  measures.  These  include  the  optimization  of  the  Germany  platform,  the  upgrade  of  technology architecture, the front-to-back redesign of processes and measures to increase infrastructure efficiency. These effects are expected to counterbalance continued inflationary headwinds and help funding selected investments in business growth and in the control environment. The bank aims for a quarterly run-rate of adjusted costs of \u20ac 5 billion in 2024 and aims to operate with total noninterest expenses of around \u20ac 20 billion in 2025.\n\nGiven the headwinds in the first quarter of 2024, the Group's guidance for the full year 2024 provision for credit losses is expected to be at the upper end of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans in light of the persistent macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Deutsche Bank remains committed to stringent underwriting standards and a tight risk management framework. Further details on the calculation of expected credit losses are provided in the section 'Management Report: Risk Report'.",

        "page_content": "Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) by year end 2024 is expected to remain essentially flat compared to 2023. The bank has received the majority of the regulatory decisions for internal credit and market risk models in 2023 with smaller ones expected in 2024. On a net basis, risk weighted assets are expected to be slightly higher from capital efficient business growth. Starting  in  2024,  Deutsche  Bank  introduces  a  new  methodology  regarding  the  allocation  of  operational  risk  RWA  to  the divisions, while the Group's operational risk RWA will be unaffected by the change, the respective divisional metrics will change going forward. Deutsche Bank aims to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13%, i.e., to operate with a buffer of 200 basis point above the bank's expected maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold, also after the impacts from the adoption of CRR 3, which is expected to become effective on January 1, 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank plans to sustainably grow cash dividends and, over time, return to shareholders through share buybacks excess capital over and above the requirements to support profitable growth and upcoming regulatory changes. For the financial year 2023, the Management Board intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of \u20ac 0.45 per share, after having paid a dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022 and \u20ac 0.20 per share for 2021. For the financial year 2024 and subsequent years, the bank targets a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders, delivered through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks. These distributions to shareholders are subject to shareholder authorization and German corporate law requirements, and in the case of share buybacks additionally require prior regulatory approval. Deutsche Bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by at least 50% year on year in 2024. The bank has received supervisory approval for a share repurchase of \u20ac 675 million, which it aims materially to complete in the first  half  of  2024,  having  completed  \u20ac 450 million  in  share  repurchases  in  2023;  and  Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  propose  a dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of \u20ac 0.45 per share, or approximately \u20ac 900 million, up from \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022, at the bank's Annual General Meeting in May 2024. For the financial years 2024 and 2025, Deutsche Bank aims for cash dividends of \u20ac 0.68 and \u20ac 1.00 per share, respectively, subject to a 50% payout ratio limitation relative to net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders. The bank has set a capital distribution goal of \u20ac 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-2025, paid in 2022-2026, and believes that it is positioned to exceed this objective based on the achievement of the bank's financial targets.\n\nBy the nature of the bank's business, Deutsche Bank is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including in the United States. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties. While Deutsche Bank resolved a number of important litigation matters and made progress on others, the bank expects the litigation and enforcement environment to remain challenging. For 2024, and with a caveat that forecasting litigation  charges is  subject  to  many  uncertainties,  Deutsche Bank presently expects net litigation charges to exceed the levels experienced in 2023. For more details, please refer to 'Provisions' of this report.\n\nDeutsche Bank's aspirations are subject to various external and internal risks, some of which the bank cannot influence. Timely and successful achievement of its strategic targets or aspirations may be adversely impacted by reduced revenuegenerating capacities of some of the bank's core businesses should downside risks crystallize. These risks include but are not limited to the uncertain future path of inflation and central bank's policies on interest rates, the Israel-Hamas war and the war in Ukraine with both having escalation potential, a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, elevated geopolitical risks, plausible cyber events, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on the bank's legal and regulatory proceedings.  A  key  focus  in  2023  was  the  persistently  high  inflation  which  drove  further  monetary  tightening,  growing expectations of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major advanced economies. Towards the end of 2023, evidence of waning inflation pressure led to a repricing of market expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial conditions. In addition, there were episodes of significant market volatility particularly around selective failures and/or restructurings in the U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the commercial real estate market, particularly in the U.S. office sector. Overall, these trends could continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and could result in fluctuations in the results  of  Deutsche  Bank's  operations,  strategic  plans  and  financial  targets.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  potential downside risks please refer to Risks in 'Risks and opportunities' of this report.\n\nAdjusted costs as well as Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this report for the definitions of such measures and reconciliations to the IFRS measures on which they are based.",

        "page_content": "## Deutsche Bank Business segments\n\n## Corporate Bank\n\nCorporate Bank revenues are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to the prior year. Revenue performance in 2023 was  marked  by  extraordinary  high  levels  of  net  interest  income,  principally  in  deposit-based  businesses,  resulting  from increased interest rates and strict pricing discipline. Corporate Bank anticipates a normalization of deposit revenues in 2024, which is expected to be partially offset by growing noninterest rate sensitive revenue streams, including commissions and fees. Despite being slightly lower compared to 2023, revenues are expected to be significantly higher than during the low interest rate environment.\n\nCorporate Treasury Services revenues are anticipated to be slightly lower due the normalization of rate pass-through in the Corporate Cash Management business, partially offset by growth in structured and flow trade finance solutions and lending. Institutional Client Services revenues are also expected to be slightly lower driven by a reduction in net interest income, partly offset by slightly higher fee income. In Business Banking, revenues are expected to be essentially flat compared to prior year, driven by business growth with stable interest income and lagging deposit payouts.\n\nProvision for credit losses is expected to be in a range of 20 to 25 basis points of average loans in 2024.\n\nNoninterest expenses and adjusted costs are expected to be slightly higher in 2024 compared to 2023, as a result of higher internal service cost allocations.\n\nRWA in the Corporate Bank are anticipated to be higher in 2024 driven by increased lending activities, changes from the aforementioned new methodology regarding the allocation of operational risk RWA to the divisions and model changes.\n\nIn addition to the risks already outlined above, risks to the division's outlook include lower economic growth in the major operating countries from ongoing supply chain disruptions, higher energy and commodity prices as well as uncertainty around central bank policies (e.g., the interest rate environment). In addition, ongoing regulatory developments (e.g., the finalization of the Basel III framework) and lower levels of client activity may also have an adverse impact.\n\n## Investment Bank\n\nInvestment Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2024 compared to the prior year. In 2024, the division expects the targeted investments made in both FIC Sales & Trading and Origination & Advisory in the prior year, combined with a broader recovery in Origination & Advisory market to drive improved performance.\n\nFIC Sales & Trading revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2023. Rates plans to consolidate its existing position, while selectively growing via targeted investments in line with client demand and market opportunities. The Foreign Exchange business will look to further technology development in spot and expand its precious metals offering. The Global Emerging Markets business will continue to further develop its onshore capabilities, for example building on the development of Latin America and client workflow solutions globally, while selectively expanding its product offering. Credit Trading intends to build on the turnaround in performance seen in the flow business in 2023. The Financing business will continue to optimize the effective deployment of resources and look to maintain our top 3 ranking globally.\n\nOrigination & Advisory revenues are expected to be significantly higher in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by an expected industry recovery and the impact of investments made in the prior year, with the acquisition of Numis bringing benefits across the business. Within Debt Origination the business expects Leveraged Debt Capital Markets to build on the partial recovery it witnessed in the prior year, while Investment Grade Debt will look to maintain its robust performance in 2023 and benefit from an expected improvement in the industry fee pool in 2024. Equity Origination will continue to provide a competitive offering across products, with a specific focus on IPOs. Advisory plans to build on the momentum of targeted investment in 2023 including the Numis acquisition, which will materially expand the businesses UK client base.\n\nProvision for credit losses in 2024 are expected to be in a range of 35 to 40 basis points of average loans. Overall provisioning levels are likely to remain elevated, as macroeconomic factors that have caused these levels are expected to continue this year.",

        "page_content": "In  2024, noninterest expenses are expected to be essentially flat compared to the previous year. Non-recurring goodwill impairment, significantly lower Bank levy charges and lower litigation settlements in 2024 are expected to be offset by a full year of costs associated with the strategic growth initiatives, along with further people and technology investments, continued inflation and increased regulatory related costs within infrastructure support.\n\nFor 2024, RWA in the Investment Bank is expected to be essentially flat compared to 2023. Increased Credit Risk RWA to support revenue growth is offset by lower allocated operational risk RWA and model changes.\n\nIn addition to the risks outlined for the Group above, risks to the outlook of the Investment Bank in 2024 include potential impacts on the business model from macroeconomic changes, including uncertainties associated with the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, while second order effects on energy, supply chain disruptions and food prices will continue to have a significant impact on financial markets. Central bank policies, specifically around interest rates and expected fiscal loosening  could  create  further  risks.  In  addition,  the  evolving  regulatory  framework  could  lead  to  unforeseen  regulatory compliance costs and possible delays in the implementation of the division's efficiency measures, which could adversely impact its cost base.\n\n## Private Bank\n\nIn 2024, the Private Bank expects net revenues to remain essentially flat compared to 2023. Growth in investment product revenues, supported by continued net inflows in assets under management driven by continued business growth, is expected to be partially offset by a decline in deposit revenues given a more competitive market environment.\n\nIn  the  Private Bank Germany, net revenues are expected to be essentially flat compared to 2023. Deposit revenues are expected to decrease due to the higher competition as well as lending due to continued elevated interest rate environment, while investment products are expected to grow. In the International Private Bank, net revenues are expected to be essentially flat year on year driven by increased investment product revenues reflecting continued business growth, partially offset by a decline in deposit revenues, while lending revenues remain essentially flat.\n\nPrivate Bank assumes continued growth in assets under management in 2024 with corresponding volumes expected to be higher compared to year-end 2023. The overall development of volumes though will highly depend on market parameters, including equity indices and foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2024, provision for credit losses is expected to be in a range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. 2023 included a small number of single name losses in the International Private Bank and higher provision for credit losses from temporary operational backlog in the second half of 2023 in Private Bank Germany.\n\nNoninterest expenses are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by significantly lower nonoperating costs. Adjusted costs are expected to be slightly lower year on year reflecting continued savings from strategic initiatives, including slightly lower headcount as well as internal service cost allocations. This will be partially offset by continued inflation impacts.\n\nRWA are expected to be higher in 2024 mainly driven by the reallocation of operational risk RWA and model changes, regulatory inflation, and loan related RWA increases.\n\nIn addition to the risks outlined for the Group above, risks to Private Bank's outlook include global inflationary pressures due to higher energy and commodity prices as well as ongoing supply chain disruptions, uncertainty on interest rates, slower economic  growth  in  the  major  operating  countries  and  lower  client  activity.  Client  activity  could  be  impacted  by  market uncertainties  including  higher  than  expected  volatility  in  equity  and  credit  markets.  The  implementation  of  regulatory requirements, delays in the implementation of strategic projects, delays in Postbank service remediation or changes resulting from contract renegotiations could also have a negative impact on revenues, capital consumption and costs.",

KGaA, of which Deutsche Bank AG owns a controlling interest.\n\nGiven the current macroeconomic outlook and the asset management industry's challenges, Asset Management intends to focus on innovative products and services where it can differentiate and best serve clients, while also maintaining a disciplined cost approach as it invests in growth and transformation. Asset Management also continues to expect its diversified asset base to provide some protection against current challenges.\n\nAsset Management expects net revenues to be slightly higher for the full year 2024 compared to 2023. Management fees are expected to remain essentially flat as slightly higher fees from flows and market impacts are expected to be counterbalanced by anticipated industry wide margin compression. Performance and transaction fees are expected to be lower in 2024 and other revenues to be significantly higher from improved investment income and lower funding allocations.\n\nNoninterest expenses and adjusted costs are expected to be essentially flat in 2024 compared to 2023, as the division expects to continue investing into growth and platform transformation.\n\nAsset Management expects assets under management to be slightly higher at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023, with continued net inflows into growth areas like Passive including Xtrackers. Net flows should be further enhanced by strategic partnerships and product innovations.\n\nRWA are expected to be higher in 2024, mainly driven by the reallocation of operational risk RWA and from model changes.\n\nIn addition to the risks described above for the Group, risks to Asset Management's outlook include protectionist and antitrade policies, that could have unpredictable consequences in the economy, market volatility and investors' confidence, which may lead to declines in business and could affect revenues and profits. In addition, the evolving regulatory framework could lead to unforeseen regulatory compliance costs and possible delays in the implementation of the efficiency measures, which could adversely impact the division's cost base.\n\n## Corporate & Other\n\nCorporate & Other is expected to generate a pre-tax loss in 2024. Corporate & Other will continue to retain shareholder expenses, which are expected to be around \u20ac 0.6 billion for the full year 2024 as well as certain funding and liquidity impacts, which are expected to be around \u20ac 0.2 billion for full year 2024. Corporate & Other will continue to record the reversal of noncontrolling interests reported in the business segments, primarily from DWS.\n\nLegacy portfolios are expected to generate a larger pre-tax loss in 2024, primarily from the non-recurrence of a litigation provision release recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.

        "page_content": "## Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe following  section  focuses  on  future  trends  or  events  that  may  result  in  downside  risk  or  upside  potential  from  what Deutsche Bank has anticipated in its 'Outlook'.\n\nThe Group's aspirations are subject to various external and internal factors, some of which it cannot influence. Timely and successful achievement of its strategic targets or aspirations including containing costs at the expected run rate, may be adversely impacted by reduced revenue-generating capacities of some of the bank's core businesses should downside risks crystallize. These risks include but are not limited to the uncertain future path of inflation and central bank's policies on interest rates, the Israel-Hamas conflict and the war in Ukraine with both having escalation potential, a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, elevated geopolitical risks, cyber events, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on the  bank's legal  and  regulatory  proceedings.  A  key  focus  in  2023  was  the  persistently  high  inflation  which  drove  further monetary tightening, risks of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major advanced  economies.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  evidence  of  waning  inflation  pressure  led  to  a  repricing  of  market expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial conditions.  In  addition,  there  were  episodes  of  significant  market  volatility  particularly  around  selective  failures  and/or restructurings in the U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the CRE market, particularly in the U.S. office sector. Overall, these trends could continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and could result in fluctuations in the results of the Group's operations, strategic plans and financial targets.\n\nOpportunities may arise if macroeconomic conditions, the inflation and interest rate environment improve beyond currently forecasted levels, leading to higher revenues and improving the Group's ability to meet its financial targets. Currently, macrofinancial forecasts feature a 'soft landing' of most advanced economies (with short episodes of a mild recession or stagnation), only moderate increases in unemployment, lower inflation rates and a significant easing of monetary policy by major central banks in 2024. At the same time, potentially higher inflation and interest rate levels and market volatility could lead to increased revenues from trading flows and higher net interest income and lending margins. Through times of volatility or uncertainty, Deutsche Bank could also benefit from helping clients navigate such financial markets. Focusing on and investing in Deutsche Bank's areas of core strengths and the implementation of its strategy may create further opportunities if implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than currently anticipated.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Macroeconomic and market conditions\n\nIn 2023, several U.S. regional banks and one major European bank either failed or were restructured leading to investor concerns over the wider banking sector. While overall fundamentals remained sound, as indicated by the 2023 U.S. CCAR and EU-wide EBA stress tests, and market volatility has subsequently reduced, these events in certain areas have increased the likelihood of a tightening of financial conditions as banks act to preserve liquidity amid higher competition for deposits and increased depositor sensitivity around concentration risks and unrealized losses on rates sensitive exposures. A pronounced tightening  in  financial  conditions  would  lead  to  more  stringent  lending  standards,  higher  client  refinancing  risks,  with Commercial Real Estate and higher leveraged corporate clients among the sectors with increased risk.\n\nMajor central banks likely reached the peak of the policy rate cycle in 2023. Headline inflation and - more recently - core inflation have shown clearer signs of progress in decelerating towards central bank targets. Financial markets have started to anticipate significant rate cuts for 2024 which has supported a significant easing of financial conditions with lower bond yields, higher equities and tighter credit spreads. However, the path of monetary policy normalization remains somewhat uncertain with central banks signaling that market expectations of early rate cuts in 2024 may be too optimistic in light of remaining inflation risks.",

        "page_content": "The lagged effects from tighter monetary policy could lead to refinancing risks and potential downgrades across the bank's client franchise while corporate default rates could continue to rise in 2024. The risk of idiosyncratic defaults also remains high. In addition, inflation, interest rates and market volatility could lead to significant collateral value reductions with risks related to recoveries in case of liquidation and therefore higher impacts on provisions for credit losses. This is particularly relevant in instances where financing is asset based and without recourse to a third party. As the lagged effects of higher rates and quantitative tightening feed through to the real economy, further liquidity events may crystallize. The bank could therefore experience higher than expected provisions for credit losses and elevated interest rates may adversely affect Deutsche Bank's planned results of operations, financial targets and costs; which may result in rating downgrades across the bank's client franchise leading to credit risk RWA inflation. More persistent inflation and higher terminal interest rates could increase clients' reallocation of savings to higher interest paying fixed deposits and dampen consumer spending and private client investments which could lead to a reduction in new lending for consumer finance and/or private mortgages. Furthermore, higher costs of living for private individuals as result of a more persistent inflationary environment could negatively affect their ability to repay credit obligations and consequently could lead to higher provisions for credit losses particularly in consumer finance.\n\nCRE markets remain under stress from the impact of high interest rates and borrowing costs, tight lending conditions and economic headwinds. Decreasing liquidity and price discovery for CRE have resulted in a pronounced decline in transactions and willingness to extend lending, particularly in the U.S. office market, with risks compounded by post-pandemic shifts in working patterns. The distressed situation in the CRE markets impacts collateral values and consequently loan-to-values, particularly in the office sector, and may result in higher than expected provision in credit losses.\n\nThe U.S. economy remained resilient in 2023, performing in line with a soft-landing scenario, with the labor market softening gradually and inflation pressures receding. Consensus GDP growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024 have continuously been revised upwards. Economic downside risks remain though, mainly due to the lagged impact of monetary tightening. The same holds  for  the  Eurozone  economy  where  economic  activity  remains  weak,  particularly  in  manufacturing,  and  country performance is divergent with Germany underperforming as the energy-induced competitiveness shock and other structural factors continue to weigh on the economy. Economic growth is projected to recover only slowly in 2024. External downside risks stem not only from the U.S. and Europe but also from China's economy where domestic activity lacks momentum and the highly indebted real estate sector is yet to show signs of a turn around.\n\nOverall, either in isolation or in combination with other risk factors such as an escalation of the China/Taiwan tensions and the political risks associated with the 2024 U.S. election, the aforementioned risks could lead to a deterioration in Deutsche Bank's portfolio quality and higher than expected credit and market losses. This could also lead to rating declines among clients, leading to increasing provisioning levels as well as increased numbers of clients drawing down on credit facilities which would lead to higher capital requirements and liquidity demands. There would also be a higher risk of idiosyncratic defaults. Higher volatility in financial markets could lead to increased margin calls, higher market risk RWA and elevated valuation reserves. Negative impacts on investor appetite may also impact the Group's ability to distribute and de-risk capital market commitments, which could potentially result in losses as well as making pricing and hedging more challenging and costly. Volatility in capital markets also increases the risk of idiosyncratic counterparty events both directly and indirectly, for example shortfalls under Lombard or securities financing transactions.\n\nThe aforementioned developments can also impact Deutsche Bank's revenue generating capabilities and costs, while market declines and volatility could negatively impact the value of financial instruments, drive volatility in the bank's valuation and timing differences and result in impairments of non-financial assets. This is particularly relevant as a decline in financial market liquidity would exacerbate price volatility and the risk of broader market stress. Market volatility, which can be also triggered by unexpected policy decisions or policy mistakes, and the challenging macro environment could also lead to increased inherent risks in several non-financial risks including transaction processing, internal and external fraud and conduct risks including attempts to conceal losses and increased litigation attempts from clients.\n\nAnother focus area is private capital markets which include certain activities from non-bank financial institutions and private credit more broadly. The non-bank financial institutions sector is extremely broad with diverse risk profiles and vulnerabilities. A failure of one or multiple larger non-bank financial institutions has the potential to drive direct losses for banks including Deutsche  Bank  and  other  creditors  /  capital  providers.  Broader  market  instability  with  rising  rates,  risk  aversion,  market illiquidity and economic slowdown all increase the likelihood of failures occurring as returns drop and investors reallocate capital.  Internal  risk  management  approaches  are  commensurate  to  the  risk  profile  of  underlying  counterparty  and concentration risk exposures and although the bank has not experienced any noteworthy losses in the past, the bank may do so in the future.",

        "page_content": "A substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group's balance sheet comprise of financial instruments that are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in its income statement. As a result of such changes, the Group has incurred losses in the past, and may incur further losses in the future. The Group is exposed to risks related to movements from foreign exchange rates, most notably related to the USD and GBP. The bank also accounts for a substantial portion of assets and liabilities at amortized costs. The fair value of these assets may be lower than its carrying value and could result in realized losses if the asset is sold prior to maturity.\n\nSimilarly, liquidity risk could arise from lower value and marketability of Deutsche Bank's High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), to which the Group during 2023, has transitioned its risk appetite from Liquidity Reserves (as defined in with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61). Moreover, Liquidity risk could affect the amount of proceeds available for covering cash outflows  during  a  stress  event.  Additional  haircuts  may  be  incurred  on  top  of  already  impaired  asset  values.  Moreover, securities might lose their eligibility as collateral necessary for accessing Central Bank facilities, as well as their value in the repo/wholesale funding market. At the same time, the Group's liquidity position may also be impaired in situations where its counterparty on e.g., a derivative contract is not current on an obligation to post collateral, in which case the bank has to cover for the shortfall through other means.\n\nThe Group is exposed to pension risks which can materially impact the measurement of Deutsche Bank's pension obligations, including interest rate, inflation and longevity risks that can materially impact its earnings.\n\nIf  multiple  downside  risks  simultaneously  materialize  and/or  occur  in  combination  with  a  more  pronounced  economic slowdown, the negative impact on Deutsche Bank's business environment could be more severe than currently expected.\n\n## Geopolitics\n\nA  number  of  political  and  geopolitical  risks  and  events  could  negatively  affect  Deutsche  Bank's  business  environment, including weaker economic activity, financial market corrections, compliance risks or a lower interest rate level.\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, which Israel responded to with a military campaign against Hamas forces and infrastructure in Gaza. Although direct risk or impacts to the bank are contained to date and no significant losses are currently expected, the key risk relates to the extent of wider escalation within the region. Going forward this may also impact oil prices, broader energy markets and global supply chains thereby undermining confidence and global growth. In early 2024, this regional escalation has increased including Houthi attacks against cargo vessels in the Red sea. The latter already impacting global supply chains, with Asia-to-North Europe freight rates more than doubling.\n\nAmidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, further sanctions packages have been introduced in 2023. New sanctions, as well as countermeasures by the Russian government, increased differences between the local application / implementation of relevant requirements by Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries in Russia and the Deutsche Bank Group, along with increasing operational complexity and creating conflict of law situations. Sanctions and Russian countermeasures, including expropriation of assets, may  also  complicate  the  wind-down  of  transactions  and  relationships  that  the  bank  may  need  to  exit.  This  regulatory environment or other restrictions could result in accounting losses or the loss of control over Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries or assets. Any of these risks could disrupt business and lead to material losses.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  Russian  government  and  economy  could  further  resort  to  activity  aimed  at  circumventing  the sanctions  imposed,  intentionally  or  unwittingly  facilitated  through  economic  operators  in  the  West  or  in  so-called  proxycountries which take a neutral position towards the Russian war against Ukraine. It may be challenging for the bank to identify such activity and protect the bank against the potential regulatory and reputational impacts of such illicit activity in all cases. Against the challenging sanctions backdrop, banks may also be implicated in economic disputes of and with counterparties which could result in costs or losses which would not occur in the normal course of business.\n\nAlso, tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated across a wide range of areas, including trade and technologyrelated issues, Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights, and cybersecurity. While the bank does not consider a China/Taiwan military conflict as its base case in the near-term, potential downside impacts from an escalation are significant and could substantially  and  adversely  affect  Deutsche  Bank's  planned  results  of  operations  and  financial  targets.  The  German government  published  its  own  China  strategy  which  envisages  German  companies  to  still  partake  in  China's  economic development whilst also encouraging diversification efforts to reduce potentially harmful concentration risks and economic dependencies on China. Recently, although in connection with the ongoing war in Ukraine, the U.S. sanctioned several Chinese and Russian companies adding to the tensions between the two countries. In September, the EU Commission announced an investigation into subsidies to Chinese electric vehicle exporters which could lead to increased tariffs and possible Chinese trade retaliation measures. Geopolitical tensions could drive further economic polarization and fragmentation of global trade with the possible emergence of distinct China vs. US-led blocks. Over the medium to long term, the International Monetary Fund among others has highlighted the potential negative impact of deglobalization on living standards and growth.",

        "page_content": "In  many  democratic  countries,  domestic  political  challenges  have  arisen  from  growing  political  polarization,  rising  social discontent  and  higher  inflation.  These  challenges  may  impede  political  decision-making  processes,  forestall  necessary structural reforms and lead to negative economic outcomes which could directly or indirectly impact the bank's risk profile.\n\nThe U.S. elections in November 2024 could increase economic and geopolitical uncertainty given that current opinion polls indicate a potentially close outcome which could usher in radically different trade and foreign policies. The EU is also holding elections in June 2024 where populist parties could increase their share of the vote, potentially increasing political polarization and fragmentation in Europe. Other regions which are holding or expected to hold local / general elections in 2024 include the UK, Turkey, South Africa and India with unexpected outcomes having the potential to drive local market volatility and economic uncertainty.\n\nThere have been a number of military coups in 2023 mainly concentrated in West Africa. None of these have had a material impact on the bank. The Bank's risk management frameworks, including its approach to managing country risk, are designed to avoid undue concentration risks to such events, but an extension of such events to other countries and regions may lead to financial losses and operational disruption in a downside.\n\nUncertainty and associated economic downside risks have declined over the three years since the UK left the EU's single market and customs union. However, negotiations between the  UK and the EU have continued, with regard to financial services not extensively covered by the existing deal. The extension to the temporary equivalence arrangements for UK CCPs (Central Clearing Counterparties) until June 2025 has temporarily removed the risk that access to  UK clearing would be withheld from EU firms, although firms are advised not to expect any further extension.\n\n## Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank's Global Hausbank strategy includes Group and divisional financial targets and objectives for the period until 2025.  While  the  Group  continuously  plans  and  adapts  to  changing  situations,  the  bank  runs  the  risk  that  a  significant deterioration in the global operating environment, an adverse change in market confidence in the banking sector and/or client behavior, as well as higher competition, could lead to the bank missing its 2025 financial targets. As such, Deutsche Bank may incur unexpected losses including further impairments and provisions, experience lower than planned profitability or an erosion of the bank's capital or liquidity base and broader financial condition, leading to a material adverse effect on Deutsche Bank's results of operations and share price. This also includes the risk that Deutsche Bank will not be able to make desired cash  distributions  and  share  buybacks,  subject  to  regulatory  approval,  shareholder  authorization  and  meeting  German corporate law requirements. Where targets reflect commitments to regulators, missing them may also trigger action from such regulators or rating agencies. In these situations, the Group would need to take actions to ensure it meets its minimum capital or liquidity  objectives. These actions or measures may result in adverse effects on Deutsche Bank's business, results of operations or strategic plans and targets.\n\nDeutsche Bank operates in highly competitive markets in all divisions. The ability to deploy capital and fund investments is an important success factor. The Group continuously monitors and responds to competitive developments to protect its market position and realize growth opportunities. Competitors in that context include large, international banks,  smaller domestic banks as well as emerging and non-banking competitors.\n\nIn 2023, labor market conditions normalized and as a result, employee turnover rates decreased significantly in all regions. More broadly,  higher  global  inflation,  which  is  only  expected  to  moderate  in  2024,  may  lead  to  pressure  on  noninterest expenses and the ability of the Group to meet cost targets.\n\nDeutsche Bank communicated various capital objectives in the section 'Strategy'. One of them relates to the CET 1 ratio, where Deutsche Bank has the objective to preserve a CET 1 ratio of no less than 200 basis points above the bank's MDA threshold with  some  variability  possible  in  2024.  The  Group's  capital  ratio  development  reflects  among  other  things:  the operating performance of core businesses; the extent of its restructuring costs and the delivery of associated benefits from change initiatives including for example front-to-back optimization programs; cost related to potential litigation and regulatory enforcement actions; growth in the balance sheet usage of the core businesses; changes in the bank's tax and pensions accounts; impacts on Other Comprehensive Income; and changes in regulation and regulatory technical standards.\n\nThe Group enters into contracts and letters of intent in connection with its ongoing transformation as well as in the ordinary course of business. When these are preliminary in nature or conditional, the Group is exposed to the risk that they do not result in execution of the final agreement or consummation of the proposed arrangement, putting associated benefits with such agreements at risk.\n\nThe financial results of the bank could be adversely impacted if anticipated benefits from mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures,  strategic  partnerships,  planned  cost  savings  and  other  investments  do  not  materialize.  At  the  same  time,  any integration  process  will  require  significant  time  and  resources,  and  the  bank  may  not  be  able  to  manage  the  process successfully.",

        "page_content": "All of the above could have a material impact on the Group's CET 1 ratio as well as other target ratios. It is therefore possible that the bank will fall below e.g., the CET 1 ratio objective of no less than 200 basis points above the bank's MDA threshold, the cost/income ratio target, or the Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity target, as highlighted in the section 'Strategy' in this report.\n\n## Liquidity and funding\n\nDeutsche Bank maintained investment grade ratings with all leading credit rating agencies through the year 2023. During 2023, Deutsche Bank was upgraded by Fitch, DBRS and S&P by one notch each.\n\nThroughout 2023, there was pressure on banks to pass on rising interest rates to customers. By the end of 2023, interest rates appear to have peaked, although quantitative tightening by central banks may continue, leading to less supply of liquidity for banks. It is possible that Minimum Mandatory Reserves levels are increased by central banks, which could reduce usable and reported liquidity and may restrict bank lending.\n\nAt the same time, a further downturn in the macro-economic environment could lead to a decline in deposit levels and loan growth. This effect could lead to customers moving away from overnight to term deposits in search of better rates in the current environment which could be further exacerbated by competitive pricing pressures from other deposit-taking institutions.\n\nEarly 2023 was a turbulent period for banks driven by failure or restructuring of several U.S. regional banks and one major European bank. While the liquidity environment of the bank has improved since the start of 2023, as demonstrated by a return of deposit balances and clients, the geopolitical and economic environment could have an adverse impact on Deutsche Bank's credit spread levels, liquidity metrics or the bank's rating in the future. As of December 31, 2023, the bank demonstrated strong liquidity and funding metrics which were well above the regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite, providing a strong basis to manage, if required, through future periods of market volatility or stress.\n\n## Postbank IT migration\n\nDeutsche Bank completed the last data migration of Postbank in July 2023. While the IT migration focused on executing the transfer of clients and employees' use of the new IT infrastructure, it led to operational issues and client backlog. Deutsche Bank has implemented several mitigation measures and devised a remediation plan, which is monitored by the BaFin via a monitor as outlined in the respective order.\n\nDeutsche Bank has made progress in remediating outstanding inquiries. In most processes, this was accomplished by year end 2023, however for selected processes the backlog remediation is ongoing and is expected to be mainly resolved by the end of first quarter 2024. There is a remaining risk when cases are not handled in a timely manner. In case the bank needs more time to process the outstanding inquiries, credit and operational costs could increase further and/or impact the bank's reputation and may result in loss of clients or business. This in turn could impact the bank's future results.\n\n## Regulatory supervisory reforms, assessments and proceedings\n\nThe regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in response to weaknesses identified during the last financial crisis together with increased regulatory scrutiny and discretion will impose material costs on the bank, create significant uncertainty and may adversely affect the Group's business plans as well as its ability to execute the bank's strategic plans in the mediumterm. Those changes that require the bank to maintain increased capital may significantly affect the bank's business model, financial condition, and results of operation as well as the competitive environment more generally.\n\nSupervisors can also impose capital surcharges or regulatory adjustments, for example, as a result of the regular Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) performed by the ECB on an annual basis. Such adjustments may, for example, reflect additional risks posed by deficiencies in the Group's control environment, concerning the treatment of specific portfolios, products or transactions. Following the 2023 SREP, Deutsche Bank has been informed by the ECB of its decision regarding prudential capital requirements to be maintained from January 1, 2024, onwards, that Deutsche Bank's Pillar 2 Requirement amounts to 2.65%, a reduction of five basis points compared to the bank's Pillar 2 Requirement applicable for 2023. ECB's SREP decision also includes, for the first time, a Pillar 2 Requirement for the leverage ratio of 10 basis points, effective from January 1, 2024, onwards. Further, the decision includes conclusions the ECB draws from regulatory stress tests conducted by the EBA or the ECB. The ECB evaluates each bank's performance from a qualitative angle to inform the decision on the level of Pillar 2 Requirement and a quantitative outcome which is one aspect when assessing the level of Pillar 2 Guidance. The ECB has already used these powers in its SREP decisions in the past and it may continue to do so to address findings from onsite inspections. In extreme cases, the ECB can even suspend certain activities or permission to operate within their jurisdictions and impose monetary fines for failures to comply with rules applicable to the guidelines.",

        "page_content": "Regulators  across  the  world  can  also  impose  capital  surcharges  to  address  macroeconomic  risks,  through  the  use  of macroprudential tools. These include CET1 buffer increases that could apply group-wide or only for local activities at national level or for specific types of exposures (e.g., mortgages). The use of these tools is governed by the applicable macroprudential framework in the EU or any other relevant jurisdiction and are typically decided by national macroprudential authorities, such as BaFin, often on the basis of Central Bank analysis for macroeconomic risks.\n\nSeveral  future  changes  to  macroprudential  tools  are  expected  to  impact  Deutsche  Bank's  business.  The  European Commission had previously announced a review of the EU macroprudential regime for 2022-2023. Deutsche Bank now understands that these reviews will not take place within the envisaged timeline. The European Commission will continue looking at these issues in 2024, and there is always a possibility for a legislative proposal, especially after the new European Commission is appointed in October 2024. Such reforms could result in an increase of the bank's level of capital requirements, including capital buffers, additional capital requirements for securitizations or an increase in risk-weighted assets.\n\nIn December 2023, the EU co-legislators, i.e., the European Parliament and the Council, confirmed their agreement for the reform of the EU prudential rules (Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive - CRR III and CRD VI), implementing the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) Final Basel III reforms. These reforms change how EU banks will calculate their risk weighted assets. The European Commission has advised that the reforms will apply as of January 2025, but the output floor, which limits the internal-model RWA to ultimately 72.5% of the standardized approach RWA, to apply fully in January 2030. Final Basel III will increase the bank's RWA and associated capital requirements. The reform is also being implemented, with different timelines, in all major jurisdictions.\n\nIn April 2023, the European Commission issued a legislative proposal for reform of the EU crisis management and deposit insurance  framework,  with  amendments  to  all  relevant  Directives  and  Regulations,  including  the  Bank  Recovery  and Resolution Directive, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. The purpose of the legislative proposal is, among other things, to further harmonize and regulate the crisis management and resolution of small- and medium-sized EU banks, which is currently subject to some degree of national discretion. In its legislative proposal the  Commission  includes  several  changes  that  could  impact  Deutsche  Bank  and  its  clients,  including  a  change  in  the insolvency hierarchy of claims of all depositors, including those uninsured by deposit guarantee schemes. Also, the proposals provide for an expanded possibility by authorities to use the funds of national deposit guarantee scheme to contribute to the resolution  of  a  bank,  and  thus  giving  also  access  to  the  Single  Resolution  Fund.  This  European  Commission  legislative proposal will now follow the regular EU co-legislative process, with the involvement of the EU 27 Member States and the European Parliament. The finalization of the revised directives and regulation may take several years, depending on the ability of the co-legislators to reach a compromise, and could differ significantly from the original Commission proposal.\n\nOn May 24, 2023, the European Commission published a Retail Investment Strategy, proposing a series of measures and amendments to the current legislative framework to boost retail investor participation and strengthen consumer trust. The strategy is currently under discussions in the Parliament and Council, before the Parliament and Council enter into political negotiations.\n\nThe political negotiations on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID II / R) concluded in June 2023. The final text is awaiting adoption by both co-legislators before being published in the Official Journal and subsequently entered into force. Further technical work on post-trade transparency requirements, through consultations by the European Commission and ESMA, is expected to continue in 2024.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the European Commission published two legislative packages, one linked to the introduction of a digital euro, the other on financial data access and payments. The European Parliament and EU Member States are now to discuss both packages. It is expected that the final legal text will only be agreed after the European Parliaments elections of June 2024.\n\nFocus in Europe is moving more towards transition finance. The European Commission has published a report that provides high level guidance on these issues. The concept of transition finance, and its development brings with it, certain uncertainties for banks. In addition, the detailed framework for the EU Taxonomy that has been put in place by European legislators will likely be reviewed by the European Commission. It is expected that the next European Commission will include both elements in its work program for 2025 to 2029. Both rapidly changing regulatory as well as stakeholder demands may materially affect Deutsche Bank's business, results of operations or strategic plans if the bank fails to adopt or implement its measures to transition to a low-carbon economy.",

If a ruling by the court is deemed to have a negative  impact  on  the  current  accounting  treatment  of  such  irrevocable  payment  commitments,  this  could  result  in  an accounting loss and have a material adverse effect on the bank's results of operations.\n\nFor  Indian  CCPs,  the  BaFin  published  a  statement  on  February  17,  2023,  allowing  German  credit  institutions,  including Deutsche Bank, the possibility to remain members of the six India CCPs until October 31, 2024. This allows European banks, including Deutsche Bank, to make any changes needed so that the clients can continue to be served even after.\n\nSupervisors can also impose other capital surcharges, such as the increase of macroprudential capital buffers including the Countercyclical Capital Buffer and the Systemic Risk Buffer.\n\nIn summary, both the regulatory and legislative environment are expected to be dynamic and can impact Deutsche Bank's revenue and costs (e.g., the cost to ensure ongoing and future compliance).\n\n## Legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations\n\nDeutsche Bank is subject to a number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations. The outcome of these proceedings is difficult to predict and may substantially and adversely affect the bank's planned results of operations, financial condition and reputation. If these matters are resolved on terms that are more adverse to the bank than expected, in terms of their costs or necessary changes to Deutsche Bank's businesses or operations, or if related negative perceptions concerning the bank's business and prospects and related business impacts increase, Deutsche Bank may not be able to achieve its strategic objectives or may be required to change these objectives.\n\nMore generally, the bank operates in a highly and increasingly regulated and litigious environment, potentially exposing the bank to liability and other costs, the amounts of which may be substantial and difficult to estimate, as well as to legal and regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. The bank continues to maintain a regular dialogue with its supervisory authorities who  expect  the  bank  to  deliver  control  improvements  at  a  faster  pace  and  in  a  higher  quality  manner.  Deutsche  Bank understands this criticism and is committed to meeting these expectations.\n\nShould any of the legal proceedings be resolved against the bank, or any investigations result in a finding that the bank failed to  comply  with  applicable  law,  the  bank  could  be  exposed  to  material  damages,  fines,  limitations  on  business,  remedial undertakings, criminal prosecution, or other material adverse effects on Deutsche Bank's financial condition, as well as risk to its reputation and potential loss of business because of extensive media attention. Guilty pleas by or convictions of the bank or its affiliates in criminal proceedings, or regulatory or enforcement orders, settlements, or agreements to which the bank or its affiliates become subject, may have consequences that have adverse effects on certain of its businesses.\n\n## Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime\n\nCombatting financial crime and complying with applicable laws and regulations is vital to ensuring the stability of banks, such as Deutsche Bank, and the integrity of the international financial system.\n\nA robust and effective internal control environment and adequate infrastructure (comprising people, policies and procedures, controls testing, and IT systems) are necessary to ensure that the bank conducts its business in compliance with the laws, regulations, and associated supervisory expectations.\n\nThe bank's compliance controls and surveillance processes, as well as other internal control processes that are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of its businesses and services as well at preventing market abuse, insider dealing, and conduct breaches, are from time to time subject to regulatory reviews and/or inquiries in certain jurisdictions.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the bank's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your client (KYC) processes and controls aimed at preventing misuse of  the  bank's  products  and  services  to  commit  financial  crime,  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  regulatory  reviews, investigations, and enforcement actions in several jurisdictions. The bank continually seeks to enhance the efficacy of its internal control environment and improve its infrastructure to revised regulatory requirements and to close gaps identified by the bank and/or by regulators and monitors.\n\nThe BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank in September 2018 to take appropriate internal safeguards and comply with general due diligence obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and in February 2019 to review the bank's groupwide risk  management processes in correspondent banking and adjust them where necessary. In April 2021, the BaFin prolonged previous orders and ordered the bank to adopt further appropriate internal safeguards and comply with due diligence obligations,  with  regards  to  regular  client  file  reviews.  This  expansion  also  applies  to  correspondent  relationships  and transaction monitoring. The BaFin has appointed a Special Representative to monitor the implementation of the ordered measures as well as to assess and report on the progress of the implementation to the BaFin.\n\nOn  September  28,  2022,  the  BaFin  ordered  Deutsche  Bank  AG  to  take  specific  measures  aimed  at  preventing  money laundering and terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that the BaFin issued on September 21, 2018, and February 15, 2019. The bank has completed the remediation activities that were the subject of this order.\n\nIn November 2023, the BaFin ordered the bank to take specific measures to improve data processing systems for transaction monitoring and has threatened to impose financial penalties in case of non-fulfillment. There are no new findings in the order, however, the order sets a binding timeframe for the implementation of measures that were already agreed. To monitor the implementation  progress  of  the  agreed  measures,  the  mandate  of  the  Special  Representative  has  been  prolonged  until 30 October 2024. The bank will continue to fully cooperate with the BaFin and the Special Representative and invest the necessary resources to implement these measures within the deadlines.\n\nIn July 2023, the bank entered into a Consent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve resolving previously disclosed regulatory discussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML compliance, a prior correspondent banking relationship and remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues. Both the Consent Order and Written Agreement require the bank to comply with and effectuate certain remedial undertakings. To the extent the Bank does not comply with such undertakings, it may face additional regulatory action, including further civil monetary penalties and business restrictions.\n\nOn September 25, 2023, DWS agreed to cease-and-desist orders and civil money penalties to settle SEC investigations. These matters related to certain historic processes, procedures and marketing practices DWS has since addressed or is in the process of addressing.\n\nIn October 2023, the BaFin imposed a fine for delayed filing of suspicious activity reports to the German Financial Intelligence Unit. The publication resulted from an administrative order issued by BaFin in this matter on March 21, 2023. Deutsche Bank has accepted the fine and the matter is resolved.\n\nAs discussed elsewhere in this document, the war in Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state entities, as well as companies and individuals linked to Russia. Export control restrictions also have increased the compliance burden  on  banks.  In  addition,  the  U.S.'s  recently  enacted  Executive  Order  14114,  which  establishes  a  new  secondary sanctions regime whereby severe measures can be taken against foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions involving broad sectors of the Russian economy, including manufacturing and technology sectors. These secondary sanction measures increase operational burden and regulatory risk for foreign banks with clients that have business operations in or with entities in  Russia.  Similarly,  several  regulators  imposed  further  sanctions  against  individuals  and  entities  with  suspected  ties  to terrorism  following  Hamas'  attack  on  Israel  in  October  2023.  Deutsche  Bank  manages  these  sanctions  with  enhanced communications,  guidance  and  operational  support  led  by  AFC's  Sanctions  &  Embargoes  team.  To  control  this  risk, transactions are filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial instruments is restricted, goods and commodities (such as oil) subject to trade finance restrictions are screened in a risk-based approach and further measures such  as  rejecting  or  freezing  a  transaction,  restricting  client  activities,  exiting  a  client  relationship  or  obtaining  required regulatory authorizations are taken.",

However, the bank may not be fully effective in mitigating its risk exposures in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that the bank fails to identify or anticipate. Where the Group uses models to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory purposes, potential deficiencies may also lead regulators to impose a recalibration of input parameters or a complete review of the model.\n\nDeutsche Bank has exposure to operational risks arising from potential failures in its internal control environment or errors in the performance of the bank's processes, e.g., in transaction processing, technology failures as well as loss of business continuity, which may disrupt Deutsche Bank's business and lead to material losses.\n\nInformation technology and security build the basis for the business operations of Deutsche Bank, complementing processes and organizational structures. The continuously evolving threats, along with evolving technology and changes in the business landscape require constant efforts to retain an acceptable level of risk. The bank maintains its ability to operate and protect itself through established security capabilities, processes and governance. However, the volatile external environment, the constant flow of new zero day exploits and other new vulnerabilities and continued use of platforms that no longer fit into the strategic architecture, remain a risk for the stability of the bank's technology with the potential of increased service outages. The potential impact in case of a security event could be wide ranging, from minor to extreme issues leading to technology failures, security breaches, unauthorized access, as well as loss or destruction of data.\n\nDelays in the implementation of regulatory requirements, including consumer protection measures and its strategic projects could also have a negative impact on the bank's revenues and costs. In addition, the Group is also exposed to conduct risk, comprising risks relating to inappropriate business practices, including selling products that are not suitable for a particular customer,  fraud,  unauthorized  trading  and  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  regulations,  laws  and  internal  policies.  For example, an employee's misconduct reflecting fraudulent intent may lead to not only material losses but also reputational damage. Conduct risk is elevated owning to increased focus by regulators on misconduct, particularly as an indicator of the health of risk management, the bank has implemented controls to monitor and mitigate the risk.\n\nAny of the aforementioned risks or events could potentially result in litigation, a financial loss, disruption of business activities and liability to the bank's customers, regulatory scrutiny, government intervention or damage to its reputation. At the same time, managing these and other risks requires continual adaptation of the bank's controls.\n\nAs a global bank, Deutsche Bank is often in the news. The bank conducts its media dialogue through official teams yet, Deutsche Bank internal information, including confidential matters have been subject to external news media coverage. Media leaks  can  have  severe  consequences  for  Deutsche  Bank,  particularly  when  they  involve  inaccurate  statements,  rumors, speculation or unsanctioned opinions. Similarly, clients of Deutsche Bank can approach the media to express dissatisfaction or  raise  adverse  communication  through  social  media  platforms,  potentially  causing  widespread  reputational  impact. Legitimate negative publication on Deutsche Bank is addressed with immediate action plans including concrete measures and commitments to clients with timely communication. While the bank has processes in place, its ability to protect itself against these risks is limited, resulting in exposure of financial consequences such as the loss of confidence or business with clients and potential impact to the bank's share price.\n\nIn the banking industry, divergence continues in how financial institutions define portfolio types and asset classes including around ESG-related themes. There are often no industry or universally accepted definitions, particularly with respect to assets intended  to  be  classified  as  Green  or  ESG-compliant,  and  differences  can  be  driven  by  divergence  between  a  risk management and accounting view. These variances could impact the way external stakeholders assess the underlying risk exposures to such portfolio types and asset classes. If losses would exceed market expectations in a certain portfolio type or asset class, this could impact the bank's reputation and adversely affect Deutsche Bank's planned results of operations and financial targets.\n\nSimilarly, there can be divergence in views when it comes to devising scenarios for e.g., stress testing purposes or in the context of scenarios applied when assessing potential provisioning requirements for institutional clients on an individual basis. As assessments of future developments are naturally exposed to uncertainties there is the risk that the future may turn out differently.\n\nIn order to manage financial and non-financial risk impacts from e.g., geopolitical or other fast developing events, Deutsche Bank utilizes dedicated governance structures including Global and Regional Crisis Management. Where relevant, additional controls and processes have been and would be employed. This would also entail additional reporting to ensure relevant senior stakeholders including the Management Board are up-to date.",

        "page_content": "## Third Party Vendor Management\n\nFinancial institutions rely on third-party service providers for a range of services, some of which support their critical operations. These dependencies have grown in recent years as part of the increasing trend in digitalization of the financial services sector which can bring multiple benefits including flexibility, innovation and improved operational resilience. However, if not properly managed, disruption to critical services or service providers could pose risks to financial institutions, and in some cases, financial stability.\n\nThe regulatory framework for managing third party risk continues to evolve and becomes increasingly complex as regulators seek to address various objectives. There are two main areas of focus including how financial institutions manage their thirdparty risks and how to address the systemic risks caused by concentration of services provided by critical third parties.\n\nThe recent examples of the publication of the Financial Stability Board toolkit on enhancing third party risk management and oversight, the consultation paper on Critical Third Parties issued by the UK regulators and Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) introduced by EU regulators demonstrate the regulators' strong intent to protect the financial stability by addressing the potential systemic risks caused by the third parties.\n\nDeutsche Bank has a well-established approach to Third Party Risk Management; from a clear policy and procedure through to centralized risk process for businesses to use when engaging with third parties. To respond to the increasing regulatory demand, Deutsche Bank is continuously  enhancing  the  bank's  current  control  environment.  In  2023,  the  bank  achieved improved efficiency, a more proportionate approach, real time monitoring and better culture of awareness to protect the bank from third party risk.\n\nWhen using third-party  service  providers,  the  bank  remains  fully  responsible  and  accountable  for  complying  with  all  the regulatory obligations, including the ability to oversee the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The bank may face risks of material losses or reputational damage if third parties fail to provide services as agreed with the bank and/or in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nSimilar to cybersecurity threats to Deutsche Bank, a successful cyberattack on a third party vendor could have a significant negative impact on the bank that may result in the disclosure or misuse of client as well as proprietary information, damage or  inability  to  access  information  technology systems,  financial losses,  additional  costs,  personal data breach  notification obligations, reputational damage, client dissatisfaction and potential regulatory penalties or litigation exposure\n\nIn situations where Deutsche Bank is the third party service provider, the bank may be exposed to financial risks, such as lost revenues, costs and expenses associated with the cancellation of the service agreement, if Deutsche Bank were no longer able to benefit from the relationship.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.\n\nOther intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. These assets are tested for impairment, or their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. This includes the testing in relation to software impairments.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques, or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change. Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets have had and may have a material adverse effect on profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Pension Obligations\n\nDeutsche Bank sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, including defined benefit plans. To the extent that the factors that drive the bank's pension liabilities move in a manner adverse to it, or that the bank's assumptions regarding key variables prove incorrect, or that Deutsche Bank's funding of the pension liabilities  does not sufficiently hedge those liabilities, the bank could be required to make additional contributions or be exposed to actuarial or accounting losses in respect of the bank's pension plans.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred Tax Assets\n\nThe bank recognizes deferred tax assets for  future tax  consequences attributable  to  temporary  differences  between  the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits. To the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or a portion of the deferred tax assets to be utilized, the bank must reduce the carrying amounts. Each quarter, the bank reevaluates  its  estimate  related  to  deferred  tax  assets,  which  can  change  from  period  to  period  and  requires  significant management judgment. Reductions in the amount of deferred tax assets from a change in estimate have had and may in the future have material adverse effects on its profitability, equity and financial condition.\n\n## Technology, Data and Innovation\n\nDigital  Innovation  offers  market  entry  opportunities  for  new  competitors  such  as  cross-industry  entrants,  global  high-tech companies or financial technology companies. Therefore, the bank expects its businesses to have an increased need for investments in digital product and process resources to mitigate the risk of a potential loss of market share.\n\nTo be able to respond to market developments, respond more quickly to client needs and to have more flexibility, and to improve IT resiliency, the bank has decided to migrate a large number of applications to the Public Cloud through a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership with Google Cloud is a major milestone in the bank's digital journey and shows a commitment to embrace new technologies. The objective is to enhance the client experience through improved products and services, system resiliency and security as well as reducing the cost inefficiencies of running legacy platforms. Such a major technology migration requires robust governance and planning, including required allocation  of funding, to manage the risk of security and stability issues. Additionally, there is significant regulatory interest in this program. Also, as with any external service providers, the bank must ensure the highest standards of data privacy and security controls to safeguard client and bank information. Failure to do so can compromise client trust, lead to financial losses and, in severe cases, regulatory penalties, litigation and the obligation to compensate individuals for damage.\n\nReliance on third parties' products and services that support critical operations can affect the bank's risk posture, because these  can  be  the  target  of  new  and  evolving  information  security  attacks.  This  risk,  along  with  expanded  regulatory requirements, has necessitated an increased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties and, where necessary, pro-actively perform outreach with them.\n\nDeutsche Bank manages third party information security risks by means of its global third-party risk management program. This program includes an information security policy specifically for third parties that sets forth the bank's control objectives and expectations. Additionally, Deutsche Bank has a third-party risk management process designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks arising from working with third parties, which includes the bank's oversight of third parties' operations related to the services provided to the bank. Deutsche Bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digitization and a continually evolving threat landscape related to information security. Cyber-attacks and other internet crime could result in material losses of client or customer information, damage the bank's reputation and lead to regulatory penalties and financial losses.\n\nThe bank closely observes relevant technological developments, the geopolitical landscape and economic impacts driving security  risks  and  assesses  their  relevance  for  potential  impact  to  Deutsche  Bank  and  the  wider  financial  ecosystem. Financially motivated and other cyber-attacks like ransomware or denial of service, can be observed as a persistent threat across industries and to become more frequent. Additional threats are posed by supply chain attacks, an increasing frequency of critical software vulnerabilities potentially exploited by threat actors (zero-day exploits), and an expanding threat surface introduced by e.g., remote ways of working or the use of cloud services. The 2023 focus areas included besides the common attack scenarios the Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.\n\nDeutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment including errors in the performance of its processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, which may disrupt the bank's business and lead to material losses. At the same time, the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage if services are not provided as agreed or in line with internal standards.\n\nDeutsche Bank and other financial institutions have experienced attacks on computer systems, including attacks aimed at obtaining unauthorized access to confidential company or client information, damaging, or interfering with company data, resources, or business activities, or otherwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure, including attacks that occurred at the bank's third-party providers. Deutsche Bank group expects to continue to be the target of such attacks in the future. Although to date the bank has not experienced any material business impact from these attacks, the group may not be able to effectively anticipate and prevent more material attacks from occurring in the future. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank continues to invest toward the protection of its systems, including data, infrastructure, devices and applications, against such breaches and toward ensuring that its vendors employ appropriate cybersecurity safeguards. These measures, however, may not be effective against the many security threats Deutsche Bank group faces.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche Bank is still maturing in its overall data management strategy against its core processes and data sets such as transactional,  client  and  reference  data.  This  includes  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  bank's  enterprise architecture principles across the core technology infrastructure. This is central to Deutsche Bank's wider technology and data strategy, enabling business growth and efficiencies, while also enhancing the control environment. Deutsche Bank's regulators are actively engaged in ensuring the bank progresses with this component of its strategy. Furthermore, the bank also faces challenges  with  respect  to  embracing  and  incorporating  new  and  disruptive  technologies  in  conjunction  with  existing technological architecture in order to ensure industry standards of information security and customer experience.\n\nMajor technology transformations in the bank's business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. The benefits of these include IT and business cost reduction, control improvements, revenue growth through provision of new client features or targeted client growth. Program execution risks, including talent and financial constraints, dependencies to other programs and key deliverables (also referred to as KDs), extended implementation timelines or impact of the change related activity on the control environment or functionality issues in the upgraded applications or underlying technology are carefully managed to partially mitigate the risk of not fully achieving expected benefits.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nThe impacts of rising global temperatures and the associated policy, technology and behavioral changes required to limit global warming to no greater than 1.5 o c above pre-industrial levels have led to emerging sources of financial and non-financial risks. These include the physical risk impacts from extreme weather events, and transition risks as carbon-intensive sectors are faced with higher costs, potentially reduced demand and restricted access to financing. More rapid than currently expected emergence of transition and / or physical climate risks and other environmental risks may lead to increased credit and market losses as well as operational disruptions due to impacts on vendors and the bank's own operations. Deutsche Bank has integrated Climate and Environmental risk considerations throughout its risk and control frameworks to ensure that risks are identified, monitored and managed.\n\nFurthermore,  financial  institutions  are  facing  increased  scrutiny  on  Climate  and  ESG-related  issues  from  governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies (including non-governmental organizations), leading to reputational risks if the bank is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to limit nature-related risks such as biodiversity and habitat loss,  and  to  protect  human  rights.  This  increased  scrutiny  includes  more  extensive  and  prescriptive  ESG  disclosure requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The emergence of significantly diverging ESG regulatory and / or disclosure standards across jurisdictions could lead to higher costs of compliance and risks of failing to meet requirements.\n\nDeutsche Bank is rated by a number of ESG rating providers, with the ratings increasingly utilized as criteria to determine eligibility for sustainable investments and to assess management of ESG risks and opportunities. The methodologies and scores used by the different providers can lead to significant divergence in results. Should the bank's ratings lag peers, or materially deteriorate, this could lead to negative reputational impacts and reduced investor demand for equity / debt. Improved ratings may have the opposite effect.\n\nData, methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks are still evolving or, in certain cases, are not yet available. This, combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry, is heavily reliant on proxy estimates and/or proprietary approaches for its own climate and environmental risk management disclosures. The high degree of uncertainty that this creates increases the risk that third parties may assert that the bank's sustainability-related disclosures constitute greenwashing. Positively, enhanced disclosure requirements for our clients will reduce reliance on proxy estimates and/or proprietary approaches going forwards.\n\nWhile Deutsche Bank remains committed to the targets and ambitions outlined in its Sustainability Deep Dive on March 2, 2023, the bank may face headwinds in achieving its aim for \u20ac 500 billion in cumulative ESG financing and investment volumes through the end of 2025. If ambitions or targets are missed, this could impact, among other things, revenues and the reputation of the bank. In addition, scarcity of ESG assets may reduce Deutsche Bank's ability to issue ESG compliant funding. Similarly, significant  deviations  from  absolute  and  intensity-based  net  zero  aligned  emissions  targets  may  open  the  bank  up  to reputational risks.\n\nCertain  jurisdictions  have  begun  to  develop  anti-ESG  measures  including  requiring  financial  institutions  that  wish  to  do business  with  them  to  certify  their  non-adherence  to  aspects  of  the  transition  agenda.  Failing  to  comply  with  these requirements  may  result  in  the  termination  of  existing  business  and  the  inability  to  conduct  new  business  with  those jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks.",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities\n\n## Macroeconomic and market conditions\n\nShould economic conditions, such as GDP growth, levels of unemployment, the interest rate environment and competitive conditions in the financial services industry improve beyond currently forecasted levels, this could result in higher revenues. These impacts may only be partially offset by additional costs, therefore improving the Group's ability to meet its financial targets.  At  the  same  time,  potentially  higher  inflation,  interest  rates  and  market  volatility  could  present  a  number  of opportunities,  such  as  increased  revenues  from  higher  trading  flows  amid  private,  corporate  and  institutional  customers repositioning their portfolios, higher net interest income as well as higher margins on lending across the Group's balance sheet.\n\nA substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group's balance sheet are of financial instruments carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. If market conditions improve or interest rates decline, this could result in an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments. As a result of such changes, the Group may realize gains in the future.\n\n## Geopolitics\n\nWhile  rising  geopolitical  risk  creates  uncertainty  which  undermines  the  global  growth  outlook  and  leads  to  increased fragmentation of the business environment, Deutsche Bank could benefit from supporting clients to de-risk their supply chains and rebalance their global footprint if the fragmentation of the international trade order accelerates. Should geopolitical risk unexpectedly subside, the outlook for global growth could improve beyond the bank's assumptions with positive implications for revenues and risk metrics.\n\n## Regulatory change\n\nRegulatory change can encourage banks to provide better products or services that can offer opportunities for differentiation in the marketplace. For example, as reporting standards continue to develop for sustainable finance, the market may evolve to embrace sustainable finance initiatives more broadly. As clients and the market adopt sustainable finance related initiatives, the Group may have the opportunity to further differentiate the bank by enhancing the services provided to its clients.\n\n## Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank's Global Hausbank strategy outlines the bank's approach to materially improve returns to shareholders over time and how best deploy the balance sheet as well as other resources, in a way that is consistent with the client franchise and  risk  appetite  of  the  bank.  As  such,  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  strategy  may  create  further  opportunities  if implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than anticipated. This includes potential benefits from better  than  planned  macroeconomic,  market  and  geopolitical  conditions  or  advantageous  changes  in  the  competitive environment, such as the retreat of traditional and emerging, non-banking competitors in selected markets.\n\nIf businesses and processes improve beyond Deutsche Bank's planned assumptions and cost efficiencies can be realized sooner or to a greater extent than forecasted, this could also positively impact the results of operations. The progress could be further stimulated if markets react favorably to Deutsche Bank's rating upgrades and sustained revenue performance. This could in turn reduce funding costs and further amplify the bank's profitability.\n\nThe bank expects to pursue the Group strategy and become the first point of call for all its clients, addressing the full range of their financial needs - as their 'Global Hausbank'. Deutsche Bank's expects its over 150-year heritage, global network, market expertise, outstanding risk management and comprehensive product range to support growth and targeted investments with focus on becoming sustainably profitable while increasing operational efficiencies and maintaining capital discipline.",

Deutsche  Bank  expects  to  grow  revenues  by  combining  risk management solutions with new treasury platform capabilities and establishing the Corporate Bank as a key partner to support its clients' energy transformation, building on its position in Europe and expanding further into APAC.\n\nThe Investment Bank continues to be a global leader in fixed income and financing products, and Deutsche Bank is focused on consolidating this position and maintaining the market share gained. To achieve this, combined with the strength of the Origination and Advisory platform, which was further enhanced with the acquisition of Numis Corporation PLC, the focus of the division is targeted on specific investment into areas of growth adjacent to current businesses to enhance and diversify the product offering. Meanwhile, the Investment Bank continues to focus on the optimization of cost and capital across the portfolio, and additional enhancements to the control environment. In addition, an increased focus upon the efficiency of the division's client coverage intends to increase the strength and depth of relationships across the global client base.\n\nFor  the  Private  Bank,  focus  remains  on  German  retail,  international  retail  and  business  clients,  and  on  seeking  growth predominantly within advisory areas. With respect to wealth management activities, the Group sees growth opportunities particularly in EMEA and APAC.\n\nFor Asset Management, comprising of DWS legal entities, DWS continues to execute the publicly stated strategy, which aims to maintain leadership in mature asset classes and selectively grow other regions and products, in order to cement its status as a leading asset manager. Growth areas include revenue opportunities from further asset shifts towards Passive investments and Alternative products.\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to focus on sustainability throughout the bank and has seen opportunities for growth in this space across all the bank's core businesses as clients' response to climate change gains further traction. Given strong client appetite, Deutsche Bank continues to see sustainable finance as a key opportunity and area of investment. As part of the broader efforts to develop a risk appetite strategy to manage climate risk, the bank sees opportunities to support clients, for example, in developing credible decarbonization strategies and support their transition.\n\nIndividuals  and  institutions,  including  clients  and  non-clients  of  the  bank,  increasingly  view  ESG-related  opportunities  as significant for long-term returns and the bank believes this could become a key differentiator. In this regard, inclusion of ESG factors  in  the  investment  processes  or  decision-making  process  for  awarding  business  mandates  across  businesses  is growing. As such, Deutsche Bank plans to develop and provide financial products or investment possibilities that can help both the bank and its clients to achieve common ESG goals and advance Deutsche Bank's holistic ESG strategy. More broadly, the bank believes that advancing ESG activities can lead to both additional revenues opportunities as well as an improved brand and stakeholder perception.\n\nAdditionally, a shared and strong firm-wide risk and control culture, enabled by technology, analytics and the bank's deep risk expertise, may, in parts provide the competitive edge needed to support the growth strategy of Deutsche Bank's businesses.\n\nOverall, there are opportunities for Deutsche Bank to gain market share and grow its client base via supporting client needs for financing, advice, and risk management.",

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative AI and Large Language Models are an area of significant potential for Deutsche Bank's operational efficiency and revenue growth. The bank is also collaborating with Google on the early adoption of new AI technologies and on 'Responsible AI' for the banking industry. The bank is experimenting with such technologies in a prudent and responsible way to ensure it understands and mitigates risks that may arise before such technologies are deployed into production. The Group's global reach allows it to scale products quickly and efficiently across geographies. At the same time, the bank's customers will benefit from products and services being developed and brought to market more quickly in the future.\n\nIn  addition,  new  forms  of  technology  create  a  new  set  of  digital  assets  and  money,  like  central  bank  digital  currencies, tokenized deposits, stablecoins or electronic securities.

Disclosures according to Pillar 3 of the Basel III Capital Framework, which are implemented in the European Union by the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and supported by EBA Implementing Technical Standards or the EBA Guideline, will be published in the Group's separate Pillar 3 report.\n\nThe following selected key risk ratios and corresponding metrics form part of the bank's holistic risk management across individual risk types. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Economic Capital Adequacy ratio, Leverage ratio, Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Stressed Net  Liquidity Position and Net Stable Funding Ratio serve as high-level metrics and are fully integrated across strategic planning, risk appetite framework, stress testing and recovery and resolution planning practices, which are reviewed and approved by the Management Board at least annually.\n\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio      |       | Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)                                        |                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 31.12.2023                             | 13.7% | 31.12.2023                                                        | \u20ac 349.7 bn                                                        |\n| 31.12.2022                             | 13.4% | 31.12.2022                                                        | \u20ac 360.0 bn                                                        |\n| Economic Capital Adequacy (ECA) Ratio  |       | Economic Capital (EC)                                             |                                                                   |\n| 31.12.2023                             | 205%  | 31.12.2023                                                        | \u20ac 23.3 bn                                                         |\n| 31.12.2022                             | 239%  | 31.12.2022                                                        | \u20ac 20.9 bn                                                         |\n| Leverage Ratio                         |       | Leverage Exposure                                                 |                                                                   |\n| 31.12.2023                             | 4.5%  | 31.12.2023                                                        | \u20ac 1,240 bn                                                        |\n| 31.12.2022                             | 4.6%  | 31.12.2022                                                        | \u20ac 1,240 bn                                                        |\n| Total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC)   |       | Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) | Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) |\n| 31.12.2023 (Risk Weighted Asset based) | 32.6% | 31.12.2023                                                        | 35.2%                                                             |\n| 31.12.2023 (Leverage Exposure based)   | 9.2%  | 31.12.2022                                                        | 34.4%                                                             |\n| 31.12.2022 (Risk Weighted Asset based) | 32.2% |                                                                   |                                                                   |\n| 31.12.2022 (Leverage Exposure based)   | 9.3%  |                                                                   |                                                                   |\n| Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)         |       | Stressed Net Liquidity Position (sNLP)                            |                                                                   |\n| 31.12.2023                             | 140%  | 31.12.2023                                                        | \u20ac 57.7 bn                                                         |\n| 31.12.2022                             | 142%  | 31.12.2022                                                        | \u20ac 48.1 bn                                                         |\n|                                        |       | Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)                                   |                                                                   |\n|                                        |       | 31.12.2023                                                        | 121%                                                              |\n|                                        |       | 31.12.2022                                                        | 120%                                                              |\n\nDeutsche Bank regularly assesses the potential impacts of risks on its balance sheet and profitability through portfolio reviews and stress tests. Stress tests are also used to test the resilience of Deutsche Bank's strategic plans. The results of these tests indicate  that  the  currently  available  capital  and  liquidity  reserves,  in  combination  with  available  mitigation  measures,  are sufficient to withstand periods of potential stress.\n\nThe Group concludes that the risks, as described above or in the following sections, to which Deutsche Bank is exposed to, including potential impacts on its business strategy, provide a true and fair picture of its risk profile.\n\nFor further details please refer to sections 'Risk profile', 'Risk appetite and capacity', 'Risk and capital plan', 'Stress testing', 'Recovery and resolution planning', 'Risk and capital management', 'Capital, leverage ratio, TLAC and MREL', 'Liquidity coverage ratio', and 'Stress testing and scenario analysis'.",

The  Group  measures  key  risks  inherent  to  the respective business models through the total economic capital metric, which captures the business division's risk profile and considers cross-risk effects at group level.\n\nCorporate Bank's risk profile mainly arises from the products and services offered in Corporate Treasury Services (including Trade Finance, Lending and Corporate Cash Management), Strategic Corporate Lending and Business Banking. Economic capital demand in these segments arises largely from credit risk.\n\nInvestment Bank's risk profile is dominated by its financing and trading activities, which give rise to all major risk types. Credit risk in the Investment Bank is broadly distributed across business units but most prominent in Fixed Income & Currencies and Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Market risk arises mainly from trading and market making activities.\n\nPrivate Bank's risk profile comprises credit risks from business with German and international retail clients, business clients and wealth management clients as well as non-trading market risks from investment risk, modelling of client deposits and credit spread risk.\n\nAsset Management, as a fiduciary asset manager, invests money on behalf of clients. As such, the main risk drivers are nonfinancial.  The  economic  capital  demand  for  market  risk  is  mainly  driven  by  non-trading  market  risks,  which  arise  from guaranteed products and co-investments in the funds.\n\nCorporate  &  Other's  risk  profile  embeds  a  range  of  different  risk  drivers  including  those  pertaining  to  Treasury,  certain corporate items, and legacy portfolios. The economic capital demand mainly comprises of non-trading market risk from interest rate risk in Treasury, structural foreign exchange risk, pension risk and equity compensation risk, credit risk from Treasury's investments, strategic risk from tax-related risks and software asset risks and operational risk from legacy portfolios.\n\nThe table below shows Deutsche Bank's overall risk position as measured by the economic capital demand calculated for credit, market, operational and strategic risk for the dates specified. Deutsche Bank's overall economic risk position also considers diversification benefits across risk types.\n\n## Risk profile of Deutsche Bank's business divisions as measured by economic capital\n\n|                                    | Dec 31, 2023    | Dec 31, 2023     | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023      | Dec 31, 2023       | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

The increase was mainly driven by the annual recalibration of the model's distribution parameters, a reduction in net short credit spread exposure arising from the Group's defined benefit pension plan assets, an increase in trading inventory to support market making and client flow in the Global Rates and Credit Trading businesses within the Investment Bank and a change in behavioral modelling assumptions of client deposits within the Private Bank.\n\nThe inter-risk diversification benefit of the economic capital demand across credit, market, operational and strategic risk totaled to \u20ac 3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, which was \u20ac 0.4 billion or 10% lower compared to year-end 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by the introduction of a compensating control for a shortcoming in the modeling of the operational risk distribution within the diversification calculation.\n\nThe operational risk economic capital usage totaled to \u20ac 4.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, which was \u20ac 0.1 billion or 2% lower than the \u20ac 4.7 billion economic capital usage as of December 31, 2022. In line with the development of the Group's RWA for operational risk, the decrease was mainly driven by a more favorable development of Deutsche Bank's internal loss profile feeding into the capital model.

Risks can be financial and non-financial and include on and off-balance sheet risks. Deutsche Bank's objective is to create sustainable value in the interests of the company taking into consideration  shareholders,  employees  and  other  company  related  stakeholders.  The  risk  management  framework contributes to this by aligning planned and actual risk taking with risk appetite as expressed by the Management Board, while being in line with available capital and liquidity.\n\nDeutsche Bank's risk management framework consists of various components, which include the established internal control mechanisms. Principles and standards are set for each component:\n\n- -Organizational structures must follow the Three Lines of Defense ('3LoD') model with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities for all risk types\n- -The 1st Line of Defense ('1st LoD') refers to those roles in the Bank whose activities generate risks, whether financial or non-financial, and who own and are accountable for these risks. The 1st LoD manages these risks within the defined risk appetite, establishes an appropriate risk governance and risk culture, and adheres to the risk type frameworks defined by the 2nd Line of Defense ('2nd LoD')\n- -The 2nd LoD refers to the roles in the Bank who define the risk management framework for a specific risk type. The 2nd LoD independently assesses and challenges the implementation of the risk type framework and adherence to the risk appetite, and acts as an advisor to the 1st LoD on how to identify, assess and manage risks.\n- -The 3rd Line of Defense ('3rd LoD') is Group Audit, which is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal control\n- -Every employee must act as a risk manager consistent with the bank's risk appetite, risk management standards and values\n- -The Management Board approved risk appetite must be cascaded and adhered to across all dimensions of the Group, with appropriate consequences in the event of a breach\n- -Risks must be identified and assessed\n- -Risks must be actively managed including appropriate risk mitigation and effective internal control systems\n- -Risks must be measured and reported using accurate, complete and timely data using approved models\n- -Regular stress tests must be performed against adverse scenarios and appropriate crisis response planning must be established\n\nThe Group promotes a strong risk culture where every employee must fully understand and take a holistic view of the risks which could result from their actions, understand the consequences and manage them appropriately against the risk appetite of the bank. The bank expects employees to exhibit behaviors that support a strong risk culture in line with the bank's Code of Conduct. To promote this, Deutsche Bank's policies require that risks taken (including against risk appetite) must be taken into  account  during  the  bank's  performance  assessment  and compensation processes. This expectation continues to be reinforced  through  communications  campaigns  and  mandatory  training  courses  for  all  DB  employees.  In  addition, Management Board members and senior management frequently communicate the importance of a strong risk culture to support a consistent tone from the top.\n\nDeutsche Bank's risk management and internal control system is described in more detail in Deutsche Bank's Pillar 3 report (specifically in the section 'Risk management objectives and policies, Enterprise Risk'). The risk management and internal control system also covers sustainability-related objectives (as outlined in the Non-Financial Report 2023, specifically in the chapters 'Sustainability strategy and implementation' and 'Climate risk').\n\nThe Management Board is of the opinion that a risk management framework and internal control system has been established which is, in its entirety, appropriate and effective for the bank's business model and risk profile.",

        "page_content": "## Risk appetite and capacity\n\nRisk appetite expresses the aggregate level and types of risk that Deutsche Bank is willing to assume to achieve strategic objectives, as defined by a set of quantitative metrics and qualitative statements. Risk capacity is defined as the maximum level of risk that can be assumed given Deutsche Bank's capital and liquidity base, risk management and control capabilities, and regulatory constraints.\n\nRisk appetite is an integral element in business planning processes via risk strategy and plan, to promote the appropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance targets, while at the same time considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and non-financial risks. Compliance of the plan with risk appetite and capacity is also tested under stressed market conditions. Top-down risk appetite serves as the limit for risk-taking for the bottom-up planning from the business functions.\n\nThe Management Board reviews and approves risk appetite and capacity on an annual basis, or more frequently in the event of unexpected changes to the risk environment, with the aim of ensuring that they are consistent with the Group's strategy, business and regulatory environment and stakeholders' requirements.\n\nIn order to determine risk appetite and capacity, different group level triggers and thresholds on a forward-looking basis are set and the escalation requirements for further action are defined. Deutsche Bank assigns risk metrics that are sensitive to the material risks to which Deutsche Bank is exposed and which function as indicators of financial health. In addition to that, the risk and recovery management framework is linked with the risk appetite framework.\n\nReports relating to risk profile as compared to Deutsche Bank's risk appetite and strategy and the monitoring thereof are presented regularly up to the Management Board. In the event that desired risk appetite is breached, a predefined escalation governance matrix is applied so these breaches are highlighted to the appropriate governance bodies.\n\n## Risk and capital plan\n\n## Strategic and capital plan\n\nDeutsche Bank conducts annually an integrated strategic planning process which lays out the development of our future strategic direction for the Group and for the business areas. The strategic plan aims to create a holistic perspective on capital, funding and risk under risk-return considerations. This process translates long-term strategic targets into measurable shortto medium-term financial targets and enables intra-year performance monitoring and management. Thereby the Group aims to identify growth options by considering the risks involved and the allocation of available capital resources to drive sustainable performance. Risk-specific portfolio strategies complement this framework and allow for an in-depth implementation of the risk strategy on portfolio level, addressing risk specifics including risk concentrations.\n\nThe strategic planning process consists of two phases: a top-down target setting and a bottom-up substantiation.\n\nIn a first phase - the top-down target setting - Deutsche Bank's key targets for profit and loss (including revenues and costs), capital supply, capital demand as well as leverage, funding and liquidity are defined and discussed for the group and the key business areas. In this process step, the targets for the next five years are based on the global macro-economic outlook and the expected regulatory framework. Subsequently, the targets are challenged and approved by the Management Board.\n\nIn a second phase, the top-down targets are substantiated bottom-up by detailed business unit plans, which consist of a month by month operative plan for year one; years two and three are planned per quarter and years four and five are annual plans. The proposed bottom-up plans are reviewed and challenged by Finance and Risk and are discussed individually with the respective business heads. Thereby, the specifics of the business are considered, and concrete targets decided in line with the bank's strategic direction. The bottom-up phase includes the preparation of plans for key legal entities to review local risk and capitalization levels. Stress tests complement the strategic plan to consider the resilience of the plan against adverse market conditions.\n\nThe resulting Strategic and Capital Plan is presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan is furthermore presented to the Supervisory Board.",

This results in ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA. As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 11.16%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 13.17%  and  a  Total  Capital  ratio  of  at  least  15.84%.  The  CET  1  requirement  comprises  the  Pillar 1  minimum  capital requirement  of  4.50%,  the  Pillar  2  requirement  (SREP  add-on)  of  1.52%,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.50%,  the countercyclical buffer of 0.45% and the systemic risk buffer of 0.19% (both subject to changes throughout the year) as well as the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.51%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.68%. Also, following the results of the 2023 SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, commonly referred to as the Pillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate from and in addition to the Pillar 2 requirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance although it is not legally binding, and failure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital distributions.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Deutsche Bank was informed by the ECB of its decision  regarding prudential minimum capital requirements for 2024 that applies from January 1, 2024, onwards, following the results of the 2023 SREP. The decision set ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.65% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2024, of which at least 1.49% must be covered by CET 1 capital and 1.99% by Tier 1 capital.",

The normative internal perspective refers to a multi-year assessment of the ability to fulfil all capital-related legal requirements and supervisory demands on an ongoing basis under a baseline and adverse scenario. The economic internal perspective refers to an internal process using internal economic capital demand models and an internal economic capital supply definition. Both perspectives focus on maintaining the continuity of Deutsche Bank on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nDeutsche Bank has implemented a stress test framework to satisfy internal as well as external stress test requirements. The internal stress tests are based on in-house developed methods and inform a variety of risk management use cases (risk type specific as well as cross risk). Internal stress tests form an integral part of Deutsche Bank's risk management framework complementing traditional  risk  measures.  The  cross-risk  stress  test  framework,  the  Group  Wide  Stress  Test  Framework (GWST), serves a variety of bank management processes, in particular the strategic planning process, the ICAAP, the risk appetite framework and capital allocation. Capital plan stress testing is performed to assess the viability of the bank's capital plan in adverse circumstances and to demonstrate a clear link between risk appetite, business strategy, capital plan and stress testing. The regulatory stress tests, e.g. the EBA stress test and the US-based CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) stress tests, are strictly following the processes and methodologies as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.\n\nDeutsche Bank's internal stress tests are performed on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of severe economic downturns as well as adverse bank-specific events on the bank's risk profile and financial position. The bank's stress testing framework comprises regular sensitivity-based and scenario-based approaches addressing different severities and regional hotspots. All material risk types are included in the stress testing activities. These activities are complemented by portfolioand country-specific downside analysis as well as further regulatory requirements, such as annual reverse stress tests and additional stress tests requested by regulators on group or legal entity level. The applied methodologies undergo regular scrutiny from Deutsche Bank's internal validation team (Model Risk Management) to ensure they correctly capture the impact of a given stress scenario.\n\nThe initial phase of Deutsche Bank's cross-risk stress test consists of defining a macroeconomic downturn scenario by ERM Risk Research in cooperation with business specialists through a formal governance forum, the Scenario Design Council. ERM Risk Research monitors the political and economic developments around the world and maintains a macro-economic heat  map  that  identifies  potentially  harmful  scenarios.  Based  on  quantitative  models  and  expert  judgments,  economic parameters such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, GDP growth or unemployment rates are set accordingly and define the narrative under which the bank's solvency position is assessed. The scenario parameters are translated into specific risk drivers by subject matter experts in the risk units. Based on the bank's internal model framework for stress testing, the following major metrics are calculated under stress: risk-weighted assets, impacts on profit and loss and economic capital by risk type. These results are aggregated at the Group level, and key metrics such as the CET 1 ratio, ECA ratio, MREL ratio and Leverage Ratio under stress are derived. Stress impacts on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other Liquidity indicators are also considered. The time-horizon of internal stress tests is between one and five years, depending on the use case and scenario assumptions.  The  Stress  Test  Council  (STC)  reviews  the  final  stress  results  followed  by  selected  presentations  to  the Enterprise Risk  Committee (ERC). After comparing these results against the bank's defined risk appetite, the ERC also discusses specific mitigation actions to remediate the stress impact in alignment with the overall strategic and capital plan if certain limits are breached. The results also feed into the recovery planning which is crucial for the recoverability of the bank in times of crisis. The outcome is presented to senior management up to the Management Board to raise awareness on the highest  level  as  it  provides  key  insights  into  specific  business  vulnerabilities  and  contributes  to  the  overall  risk  profile assessment of the bank.\n\nThe group wide stress tests performed in 2023 indicated that the bank's capitalization  together with  available  mitigation measures as defined in the Group Recovery Plan is adequate to reach the internally set stress exit levels.",

        "page_content": "The cross-risk reverse stress test leverages the GWST framework and is typically performed annually in order to challenge Deutsche Bank's business model by determining scenarios which would cause the bank to become unviable. Such a reverse stress  test  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  macroeconomic  scenario  enriched  by  idiosyncratic  events  based  on  the  top  risks monitored by each risk type. Comparing the non-viability scenario to the current economic environment, the probability of occurrence of such a hypothetical stress scenario is considered to be extremely low. Given this, it is the bank's view that its business continuity is not at risk.\n\nAs required by ECB, the bank has performed multi-year stress tests as part of the annual strategic planning process for 2023 using two adverse heatmap scenarios, namely a 'EU led hard landing scenario' and a 'Higher for longer interest rates' scenario.\n\nIn addition to the GWST that includes all material risk types and major revenue streams, Deutsche Bank has individual stress test programs in place for all relevant risk metrics in line with regulatory requirements. The relevant stress test programs are described in the sections about the individual risk management methods.\n\nDeutsche Bank also took part in two major regulatory stress tests performed in 2023 i.e. the bi-annual European EBA stress test as well as the US-based CCAR stress test, as implemented pursuant to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. The outcome of the EBA stress test is feeding into the SREP process for Deutsche Bank. In the CCAR context, the Federal Reserve (FRB) disclosed the stress capital  depletion  for  DB  USA  Corporation  and  DWS USA Corporation; this showed that each entity remains very well-capitalized even after withstanding a hypothetical severe stress environment.\n\nAlso in 2023, the bank ran an internal climate transition risk stress test across its global portfolios focusing on a near-term time horizon (three years) under severe assumption of a front-loaded disorderly transition. The results of the stress test are integrated into relevant processes, including risk appetite, business planning and ICAAP.\n\n## Risk measurement and reporting systems\n\n## Overview\n\nDeutsche  Bank's  risk  measurement  systems  support  regulatory  reporting  and  external  disclosures,  as  well  as  internal management reporting across all  risk  types.  The  risk  infrastructure  incorporates  the  relevant  legal  entities  and  business divisions and provides the basis for reporting on risk positions, capital adequacy and limit, threshold, or target utilization to the relevant functions on a regular and ad-hoc basis. Established units within the CFO and CRO function assume responsibility for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk while promoting sufficient quality and integrity of risk-related data and consider, where relevant, the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as per the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's regulation number 239 ('BCBS 239'). The Group's risk management systems are reviewed by Group Audit following a risk-based audit approach.\n\nDeutsche Bank's reporting is an integral part of Deutsche Bank's risk management framework and as such aligns with the organizational setup by delivering consistent information on Group level and for material legal entities as well as breakdowns by risk types, business division and material business units.\n\nThe following principles guide Deutsche Bank's 'risk measurement and reporting' practices:\n\n- -Deutsche Bank monitors risks taken against risk appetite and risk-reward considerations on various levels across the Group, e.g. Group, business divisions, material business units, material legal entities, risk types, material asset classes, portfolio and counterparty levels\n- -Risk reporting is required to be accurate, clear, useful and complete and must convey reconciled and validated risk data to communicate information in a concise manner to ensure, across material Financial and Non-Financial Risks, the bank's risk profile is clearly understood\n- -Senior risk committees, such as the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, as well as the Management Board who are responsible for risk and capital management receive regular reporting (as well as ad-hoc reporting as required)\n- -Dedicated teams within Deutsche Bank proactively manage material Financial and Non-Financial Risks and must ensure that required management information is in place to enable proactive identification and management of risks and avoid undue concentrations within a specific Risk Type and across risks (Cross-Risk view)\n\nIn applying the previously mentioned principles, Deutsche Bank maintains a common basis for all risk reports and aims to minimize  segregated  reporting  efforts  to  allow  Deutsche  Bank  to  provide  consistent  information,  which  only  differs  by granularity and audience focus.",

Deutsche  Bank designates a subset of those as 'Key Risk Metrics' that represent the most critical ones for which the Bank places an appetite, limit, threshold or target at Group level and / or are reported routinely to senior management for discussion or decision making. The identified Key Risk Metrics include Capital Adequacy and Liquidity metrics; further details can be found in the section 'Key risk metrics'.\n\n## Key risk reports\n\nWhile a large number of reports are used across the Bank, Deutsche Bank designates a subset of these as 'Key Risk Reports' that are critical to support Deutsche Bank's Risk Management Framework through the provision of risk information to senior management and therefore enable the relevant governing bodies to monitor, steer and control the Bank's risk taking activities effectively. To ensure that Key Risk Reports meet recipients' requirements, report producing functions regularly check whether the Key Risk Reports are clear and useful.\n\nThe main reports on risk and capital management that are used to provide Deutsche Bank's central governance bodies with information relating to the Group risk profile are the following:\n\n- -The monthly Risk and Capital Profile report is a Cross-Risk report, provides a comprehensive view of Deutsche Bank's risk profile and is used to inform the ERC, the Group Risk Committee as well as the Management Board and subsequently the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Risk and Capital Profile includes Risk Type specific and Business-Aligned overviews and Enterprise-wide risk topics; it also includes updates on Key Group Risk Appetite Metrics and other Key Portfolio Risk Type Control Metrics as well as updates on Key Risk Developments, highlighting areas of particular interest with updates on corresponding risk management strategies\n- -The Weekly Risk Report is a weekly briefing covering high-level topical issues across key risk areas and is submitted every Friday to the Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee and the Management Board and subsequently to the Members of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Weekly Risk Report is characterized by the ad-hoc nature of its commentary as well as coverage of themes and focuses on more volatile risk metrics\n- -Deutsche Bank runs several Group-wide macroeconomic stress tests. A monthly Risk Appetite scenario serves the purpose to set and regularly monitor the bank's stress loss appetite; in addition, there are topical scenarios which are reported to and discussed in the Enterprise Risk Committee and escalated to the Group Risk Committee if deemed necessary; the stressed key performance indicators are benchmarked against the Group Risk Appetite thresholds\n\nWhile the above reports are used at a Group level to monitor and review the risk profile of Deutsche Bank holistically, there are other, supplementing standard and ad-hoc management reports, including for Risk Types or Focus Portfolios, which are used to monitor and control the risk profile.",

        "page_content": "## Recovery and resolution planning\n\nIn the EU, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM Regulation) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) aim at reducing the likelihood of another financial crisis, enhance the resilience of institutions under stress, and eventually support the long-term stability of the financial systems without exposing taxpayers' money to losses.\n\nIn line with the provisions of the SRM Regulation and the BRRD (which were mainly implemented in Germany by the German Recovery  and  Resolution  Act  (Sanierungs-  und  Abwicklungsgesetz,  SAG)),  Deutsche  Bank  maintains  a  recovery  and resolution planning framework designed to identify and manage the impact of adverse events in a timely and coordinated manner.\n\nThe  bank  maintains  a  Group  recovery  plan  specifying  measures  to  restore  the  financial  position  following  a  significant deterioration of its financial situation. The Group recovery plan is updated at least annually and approved by the Management Board.\n\nThe Group resolution plan on the other hand is prepared by the resolution authorities, rather than by the bank itself. Deutsche Bank works closely with the Single Resolution Board and the Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) who establish the Group resolution plan for Deutsche Bank, which is currently based on a single point of entry bail-in as the preferred resolution strategy. Under the single point of entry bail-in strategy, the parent entity Deutsche Bank AG would be recapitalized through a write-down and/or conversion to equity of capital instruments (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2) and other eligible liabilities in order to stabilize the Group. Within one month after the application of the bail-in tool to recapitalize  an  institution,  the  BRRD  (as  implemented  in  the  SAG)  requires  such  institution  to  prepare  a  business reorganization plan, addressing the causes of failure and aiming to restore the institution's long-term viability. To  further support  and  improve  operational  continuity  of  the  bank  for  resolution  planning  purposes,  Deutsche  Bank  has  completed additional preparations, such as adding termination stay clauses into client financial agreements governed by non-EU law and including continuity provisions into key service agreements. Financial contracts and service agreements governed by EU law are already covered by statutory laws which prevent termination solely due to any resolution measure.\n\nThe BRRD requires banks in EU member states to maintain minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities to make  resolution  credible  by  establishing  sufficient  loss  absorption  and  recapitalization  capacity.  Apart  from  MRELrequirements, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, is subject to global minimum standards for Total LossAbsorbing Capacity, which set out strict requirements for the amount and eligibility of instruments to be maintained for bail-in purposes. In particular, TLAC instruments must be subordinated (including so-called senior non-preferred debt, but also in the form of regulatory capital instruments) to other senior liabilities. This ensures that a bail-in would be applied first to equity and TLAC instruments, which must be exhausted before a bail-in may affect other senior (preferred) liabilities such as senior preferred plain vanilla bonds, debt instruments that are structured, deposits and derivatives.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Deutsche  Bank  AG  is  required  under  Title  I  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and  Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), as amended, to prepare and submit to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) either a full or targeted resolution plan (the U.S. Resolution Plan) on a timeline prescribed by such agencies. The U.S. Resolution Plan must demonstrate that the Deutsche Bank AG has the ability to execute and implement a strategy for the orderly resolution of its designated U.S. material entities and operations. For foreignbased companies subject to these resolution planning requirements such as Deutsche Bank AG, the U.S. Resolution Plan relates only to subsidiaries, branches, agencies and businesses that are domiciled in or whose activities are carried out in whole or in material part in the United States. Deutsche Bank's U.S. Resolution Plan describes the single point of entry strategy for  Deutsche  Bank's  U.S.  material  entities  and  operations  and  prescribes  that  DB  USA  Corporation,  one  of  the  bank's intermediate holding companies, would provide liquidity and capital support to its U.S. material entity subsidiaries and ensure their solvent wind-down outside of applicable resolution proceedings.\n\nDeutsche Bank filed its first 'targeted' U.S. Resolution Plan on December 17, 2021, which described the core elements of Deutsche Bank's U.S. resolution strategy, such as capital, liquidity, and recapitalization strategies, as well as how Deutsche Bank has integrated lessons learned from its response to the COVID-19 pandemic into its resolution planning process. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC (Agencies) announced the results of their review of Deutsche Bank's 2021 U.S. Resolution Plan, as well as those of other banks, and did not find any shortcomings or deficiencies in Deutsche Bank's plan. In their feedback letter to Deutsche Bank, the agencies noted areas where further progress will help improve  resolvability.  Proposed  guidance  was  also  issued  in  August  2023  by  the  Agencies  which  will  amend  resolution planning requirements for certain foreign filers, including Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank's next full resolution plan submission is due to be filed by for March 31, 2025.",

Treasury implements Deutsche Bank's capital strategy, which itself is developed by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group Asset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders' equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank's sound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The bank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank's overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance.\n\nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying back Deutsche Bank's issuances below par.\n\nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank's foreign subsidiaries and branches is either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.\n\n## Resource limit setting\n\nUsage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.\n\nTarget resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank's annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank's CET 1 and Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank's quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that are based on the strategic  plan but  adjusted  for  market  conditions  and  the  short-term  outlook.  Limits  are  enforced  through  a  close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism.\n\nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined contribution of each segment to the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group's Leverage ratio and the Group's Capital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The Group's Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.\n\nMost of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank's branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank's capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank's  branches  and subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution.\n\nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank's Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank's investment objective to protect the capital base and distribution capacity of the bank.",

This assessment incorporates input from both first and second line of defense, with the identified risks assessed for materiality based on their severity and likelihood of materialization. The assessment of risks is complemented by a view on emerging risks applying a forward-looking perspective. This risk identification and assessment process results in the risk inventory which captures the material risks for the Group, and where relevant, across businesses, entities and branches.\n\nRegular updates to the Group risk inventory are reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee for review and approval. The inventory is also discussed in the Group Risk Committee and reported to the Management Board. The inventory informs key risk  management  processes,  including  the  development  of  stress  scenarios  tailored  to  Deutsche  Bank's  risk  profile  and informing risk appetite setting and monitoring. Risks in the inventory are also mapped to risks in the Group risk type taxonomy, where a corresponding materiality assessment is also provided.\n\n## Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality\n\n## Credit risk framework\n\nCredit risk arises from all transactions where actual, contingent or potential claims against any counterparty, borrower, obligor or issuer (which Deutsche Bank refers to collectively as 'counterparties') exist, including those claims that Deutsche Bank plans to distribute. It captures the risk of loss because of a deterioration of a counterparty's creditworthiness or the failure of a counterparty to meet the terms of any contract with Deutsche Bank or otherwise perform as agreed.\n\nBased  on  the  Risk  Type  Taxonomy,  credit  risk  is  grouped  into  four  material  categories,  namely  default/migration  risk, transaction/settlement risk (exposure risk), mitigation risk and credit concentration risk. This is complemented by a regular risk identification and materiality assessment.\n\n- -Default/migration risk as the main element of credit risk, is the risk that a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations or experiences material credit quality deterioration increasing the likelihood of a default\n- -Transaction/settlement risk is the risk that arises from any existing, contingent or potential future positive exposure\n- -Mitigation risk is the risk of higher losses due to risk mitigation measures not performing as anticipated\n- -Credit concentration risk is the risk of an adverse development in a specific single counterparty, country, industry or product leading to a disproportionate deterioration in the risk profile of Deutsche Bank's credit exposures to that counterparty, country, industry or product\n\nDeutsche Bank manages its credit risk using the following philosophy and principles:\n\n-\n\nCredit Risk is only accepted:\n\n- -for adopted clients\n- -after completed appropriate due diligence led by the respective origination teams as 1st LoD\n- -New products and changes to existing products have to be assessed within DB Group's new product approval (NPA) framework\n- -If a Rating has been assigned in line with agreed and approved processes\n- -If all credit relevant exposures are correctly reflected in the relevant risk systems\n- -If plans for an orderly termination of the risk positions have been considered\n- -Credit Risk is assumed within the applicable Risk Appetite limits set for divisions, countries, industries, etc.\n- -P&L responsibility for credit exposures is owned by the originating Group Division\n- -Risk taken needs to be adequately compensated\n- -Risk must be continuously monitored and managed across 1st and 2nd LoD\n- -Credit standards are applied consistently across all Group Divisions in order to maintain a favorable risk profile in line with the Risk Appetite\n- -Collateral or other risk mitigating, hedging or rating transfer instruments, which can be an alternative source of repayment do not substitute for underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of a counterparty has to be performed during the credit process; essentially rating transfer instruments are supporting documents (e.g., comfort letters or parental guarantees) helping the debtor to prevent a default; consequently, this effect can be considered in the Probability of Default\n- -Deutsche Bank strives  to  adequately  secure,  guarantee  or  hedge  outright  cash  risk  and  longer  tenor-exposures;  this approach does usually not include lower risk short-term transactions and facilities supporting specific trade finance or other lower risk products where the margin allows for adequate loss coverage",

Each counterparty must be rated, and each rating has to be reviewed at least annually supported by ongoing monitoring of counterparties. A credit rating is a prerequisite for any credit limit established/ approved. For each credit rating, the appropriate rating approach has to be applied and the derived credit rating has to be established in the relevant systems. Specific rating approaches have been established to best reflect the respective  characteristics  of  exposure  classes,  including  specific  product  types,  central  governments  and  central  banks, institutions, corporates and retail.\n\nCounterparties in the bank's non-retail portfolios are rated by Deutsche Bank's independent Credit Risk Management function partly  using  automated  Rating  systems.  Given  the  largely  homogeneous  nature  of  the  retail  portfolio,  counterparty creditworthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine. Country risk-related ratings are provided by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Risk Research.\n\nDeutsche Bank's rating analysis is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors. When rating a counterparty Deutsche Bank applies in-house assessment methodologies, scorecards and the bank's 21-grade rating scale for evaluating the creditworthiness of the bank's counterparties.\n\nChanges  to  existing  credit  models  and  introduction  of  new  models  are  approved  by  the  Regulatory  Credit  Risk  Model Committee (RCRMC) chaired by the Head of Credit Risk Management before the models are used for credit decisions and capital calculation for the first time or before they are significantly changed. Separately, for all model changes and for new models an approval by Model Risk Management is required. Proposals with high impact are recommended for approval to the Group  Risk  Committee.  Furthermore,  regulatory  approval  may  also  be  required.  The  model  validation  is  performed independently of model development by Model Risk Management. The results of the regular validation processes as stipulated by internal policies are brought to the attention of the RCRMC, even if the validation results do not lead to a change.\n\nDeutsche Bank measures risk-weighted assets to determine the regulatory capital demand for credit risk using 'advanced', 'foundation'  and  'standard'  approaches  of  which  'advanced'  and  'foundation'  approaches  are  approved  by  the  bank's regulator.\n\nThe advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) is the most sophisticated approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk and allows Deutsche Bank to make use of the bank's internal credit rating models as well as internal estimates of specific further risk parameters. These methods and parameters represent long-used key components of the internal  risk  measurement  and  management  process  supporting  the  credit  approval  process,  the  economic  capital  and expected  loss  calculation  and  the  internal  monitoring  and  reporting  of  credit  risk.  The  relevant  parameters  include  the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the maturity (M) driving the regulatory risk-weight and the credit conversion  factor  (CCF)  as  part  of  the  regulatory  exposure  at  default  (EAD)  estimation.  For  the  majority  of  derivative counterparty exposures as well as securities financing transactions (SFT), Deutsche Bank makes use of the internal model method (IMM) in accordance with CRR to calculate EAD. For most of the bank's internal rating systems more than seven years of historical information is available to assess these parameters. Deutsche Bank's internal rating methodologies aim at point-in-time rather than a through-the-cycle rating, but in line with regulatory solvency requirements, they are calibrated based on long-term averages of observed default rates.\n\nThe foundation IRBA is an approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk allowing institutions to make use of  their  internal  rating  methodologies  while  using  pre-defined  regulatory  values  for  all  other  risk  parameters.  Parameters subject to internal estimates include the PD while the LGD and the CCF are defined in the regulatory framework. Foundation IRBA remains in place for some exposures stemming from ex-Postbank.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche  Bank  applies  the  standardized  approach  to  a  subset  of  its  credit  risk  exposures.  The  standardized  approach measures credit risk either pursuant to fixed risk weights, which are predefined by the regulator, or through the application of external ratings. Deutsche Bank assigns certain credit exposures permanently to the standardized approach in accordance with Article 150 CRR. These are predominantly exposures to the Federal Republic of Germany and other German public sector  entities  as  well  as  exposures  to  central  governments  of  other  European  Member  States  that  meet  the  required conditions.  These  exposures  make  up  the  majority  of  the  exposures  carried  in  the  standardized  approach  and  receive predominantly a risk weight of zero percent. For internal purposes, however, these exposures are subject to an internal credit assessment and fully integrated in the risk management and economic capital processes.\n\nIn addition to the above-described regulatory capital demand, Deutsche Bank determines the internal capital demand for credit risk via an economic capital model.\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates economic capital for the default risk, country risk and settlement risk as elements of credit risk. In line with the bank's economic capital framework, economic capital for credit risk is set at a level to absorb with a probability of 99.9% very severe aggregate unexpected losses within one year. Deutsche Bank's economic capital for credit risk is derived from the loss distribution of a portfolio via Monte Carlo Simulation of correlated rating migrations. The loss distribution is modeled in two steps. First, individual credit exposures are specified based on parameters for the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. In a second step, the probability of joint defaults is modeled through the introduction of  economic  factors,  which  correspond  to  geographic  regions  and  industries.  The  simulation  of  portfolio  losses  is  then performed by an internally developed model, which takes rating migration and maturity effects into account. Effects due to wrong-way derivatives risk (i.e., the credit exposure of a derivative in the default case is higher than in non-default scenarios) are modeled by applying the bank's own alpha factor when deriving the exposure at default for derivatives and securities financing transactions under the CRR. Deutsche Bank allocates expected losses and economic capital derived from loss distributions down to transaction level to enable management on transaction, customer and business level.\n\nBesides the credit rating, as a key component for managing the bank's credit portfolio, including individual transaction approval and the setting of risk appetite, Deutsche Bank establishes credit limits for all credit exposures. Credit limits set forth maximum credit exposures Deutsche Bank is willing to assume over specified periods. In determining the credit limit for a counterparty, Deutsche Bank considers the counterparty's credit quality above others by reference to its internal credit rating. Credit limits and credit exposures are both measured on a gross and net basis where net is derived by deducting appropriate hedges and certain collateral from respective gross figures. For derivatives, Deutsche Bank looks at current market values and the potential future exposure over the relevant time horizon, which is based upon the bank's legal agreements with the counterparty.\n\n## IFRS 9 Impairment\n\nIn the following chapter, the Group provides an overview of the IFRS 9 impairment framework and how it is embedded into Deutsche Bank's credit risk management activities. The disclosure provides a description of the Group's IFRS 9 model and methodology, changes implemented in 2023 as well as key model assumptions. This chapter also highlights novel risks in focus in 2023 and how Deutsche Bank assessed impact of these latest developments on its ECL calculations, and in particular, how the model properly takes into account the impacts of the uncertainties noted in 2023 and at year end, along with the impact from reasonable changes in the Group's key model assumptions.\n\nThese  credit  risk  management  activities  and  assessments  are  embedded  in  the  bank's  overall  control  and  governance framework for credit risk which includes the estimation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 and the governance around the models used. These activities include, but are not limited to, regular emerging risk reviews as well as portfolio deep dives, day to day risk management on the level of individual borrowers, as well as regular model validations. Further explanations are provided regarding management overlays applied to the credit loss allowance, how reviews of relevant assumptions and inputs to the ECL calculation are performed and how as part of the model reviews, potential model imprecision and whether any overlays were necessary, are assessed. The Group also presents background on management overlays recorded at the end of 2022, throughout 2023 and at the end of 2023. To provide additional transparency on the impact of reasonable changes to the key assumptions, model sensitivities are presented in a separate section which concludes with the key drivers for the IFRS 9 model results.",

        "page_content": "## Description of IFRS 9 Model and Methodology\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or fair value through other  comprehensive  income  and  to  off  balance  sheet  lending  commitments,  such  as  loan  commitments  and  financial guarantees. For purposes of the bank's impairment approach, the Group refers to these instruments as financial assets.\n\nThe Group determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 as follows:\n\n- -Stage 1 reflects financial assets where it is assumed that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition\n- Stage 2 contains all financial assets, that are not defaulted, but have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since\n- -initial recognition\n- -Stage 3 consists of financial assets which deemed to be in default in accordance with Deutsche Bank's policies, which are based on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Article 178. The Group defines these financial assets as impaired, non-performing and defaulted\n- -Significant increase in credit risk is determined using quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group's historical experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information\n- -Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets where at the time of initial recognition, there is objective evidence of impairment and the Group purchased at a discount.\n\nThe IFRS 9 impairment approach is an integral part of the Group's credit risk management procedures. The estimation of expected credit loss (ECL) is either performed via the automated, parameter based ECL calculation using the Group's ECL model or determined by credit officers. In both cases, the calculation takes place for each financial asset individually. Similarly, the determination of the need to transfer between stages is made on an individual asset basis. The Group's ECL model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as for Stage 3 in the homogeneous portfolio (i.e., retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). For financial assets in the bank's non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses is determined individually by credit officers.\n\nThe Group uses three main components to measure ECL. These are Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). The Group leverages existing parameters used for determination of capital demand under the Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) and internal risk management practices as much as possible to calculate ECL. These parameters are adjusted where necessary to comply with IFRS 9 requirements (e.g., use of point in time ratings and removal of downturn add-ons in the regulatory parameters). Incorporating forecasts of future economic variables into the measurement of ECL influences the allowance for credit losses. In order to calculate lifetime ECL, the Group's calculation derives the corresponding lifetime PDs from migration matrices that reflect economic forecasts.\n\nIn July 2023, the Group completed the migration of Postbank clients into the IT systems of Deutsche Bank, which resulted in a Group-wide alignment of the IFRS 9 impairment model and methodologies, while specific models previously applied for Postbank were decommissioned. This change in estimate resulted in an immaterial net increase in the Group's allowance for credit losses.\n\nIn September 2023, the Group received approval from authorities to align the Probability of Default (PD) model for large corporates and leveraged lending with regulatory requirements. The model is used for the determination of capital demand under the Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach, for internal risk management practices and is leveraged for IFRS 9 ECL purposes. The related change in estimate reduced the Group's ECL as of September 30, 2023, by \u20ac 101 million.\n\n## Stage Determination and Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nAt initial recognition, financial assets are reflected in Stage 1, unless the financial assets are POCI. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the financial asset is transferred to Stage 2. A significant increase in credit risk is determined by using rating-related and process-related indicators. The transfer of financial assets to Stage 3 is based on the status of the borrower being in default. If a borrower is in default, all financial assets of the borrower are transferred to Stage 3.\n\nRating-related  Stage  2  indicators:  The  Group  compares  a  borrower's  lifetime  PD  at  the  reporting  date  with  lifetime  PD expectations at the date of initial recognition to determine if there has been a significant change in the borrower's PDs and consequently to any of the borrower's transaction in the scope of IFRS 9 impairment. Based on historically observed migration behavior and a sampling of different economic scenarios, a lifetime PD distribution is obtained. A quantile of this distribution, which is defined for each counterparty class, is chosen as the lifetime PD threshold. If the remaining lifetime PD of a transaction according to current expectations exceeds this threshold, the financial asset is deemed to have incurred a significant increase in credit risk and is transferred to Stage 2. The quantiles used to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined using expert judgment,  are  reviewed  annually  and  have  not  changed  since  implementation  of  IFRS  9.  The  thresholds  applied  vary depending  on  the  original  credit  quality  of  the  borrower,  elapsed  lifetime,  remaining  lifetime  and  counterparty  class. Management believes that the defined approach and quantiles represent a meaningful indicator that a financial asset has incurred a significant increase in credit risk.",

        "page_content": "Process-related Stage 2 indicators are derived via the use of existing risk management indicators, which in the bank's view represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include borrowers being added to  the  Group's  watchlist,  being  transferred  to  workout  status,  payments  being  30  days  or  more  past  due  or  being  in forbearance. As long as the condition for one or more of the process-related or rating-related indicators is fulfilled and the borrower of the financial asset has not met the definition of default, the asset will remain in Stage 2. If the Stage 2 indicators are no longer fulfilled and the financial asset has not defaulted, the financial asset transfers back to Stage 1. In case of performing forborne financial assets, the probation period is 2 years before the financial asset is reclassified to Stage 1, which is aligned with regulatory guidance.\n\nIf the borrower defaults, all transactions of the borrower are allocated to Stage 3. If, at a later date, the borrower is no longer in  default,  the  curing  criteria  according  to regulatory guidance is applied (including probation periods), which are at least 3 months or 1 year in case of distressed restructurings. Once the regulatory cure period or criteria has been met, the borrower will cease to be classified as defaulted and will be transferred back to Stage 2 or Stage 1.\n\nThe ECL calculation for Stage 3 distinguishes between transactions in the homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios, as well  as  POCI  financial  assets.  For  transactions  that  are  in  Stage  3  and  in  a  homogeneous  portfolio,  the  Group  uses  a parameter-based automated approach to determine the credit loss allowance per transaction. For these transactions, the LGD parameters are to a large extent modelled to be time-dependent, i.e., consider the declining recovery expectation as time elapses after default. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets in the bank's non-homogeneous portfolios in Stage 3, as well as for POCI assets are determined by credit officers and have to be approved along an established authority grid up to and including the Management Board. This allows credit officers to consider currently available information and recovery expectations specific to the borrowers and the financial assets at the reporting date.\n\n## Estimation Techniques for Key Input Factors\n\nThe first key input factor in the Group ECL calculation is the one-year PD for borrowers which is derived from the bank's internal rating systems. The Group assigns a PD to each borrower credit exposure based on a 21-grade master rating scale for all of the Group's exposure.\n\nThe borrower ratings assigned are derived based on internally developed rating models which specify consistent and distinct customer-relevant criteria and assign a rating grade based on a specific set of criteria as given for a certain customer. The set of  criteria  is  generated  from  information  sets  relevant  for  the  respective  customer  segments  including  general  customer behavior, financial and external data (e.g., credit bureau). The methods in use range from statistical scoring models to expertbased models taking into account the relevant available quantitative and qualitative information. Expert-based models are usually applied for borrowers in the exposure classes 'Central governments and central banks', 'Institutions' and 'Corporates' with the exception of those 'Corporates' for which a sufficient data basis is available for statistical scoring models. For the latter, as well as for the retail segment, statistical scoring or hybrid models combining both approaches are commonly used. Quantitative  rating  methodologies  are  developed  based  on  applicable  statistical  modelling  techniques,  such  as  logistic regression.\n\nOne-year PDs are extended to multi-year PD curves using through-the-cycle matrices and macroeconomic forecasts. Based on  economic  scenarios  centered  around  the  macroeconomic  baseline  forecast,  through-the-cycle  matrices  are  first transformed into point-in-time rating migration matrices, typically for a two-year period. The calculation of the point-in-time matrices leverages a link between macroeconomic variables and the default and rating behavior of borrowers, which is derived from historical macroeconomic variables (MEVs) and rating time series through regression techniques. In a final step, multiyear  PD  curves  are  derived  from  point-in-time  rating  migration  matrices  for  periods  where  reasonable  and  supportable forecasts are available and extrapolated based on through-the-cycle rating migration matrices beyond those periods.\n\nThe second key input factor into the ECL calculation is the LGD parameter, which is defined as the likely loss intensity in case of a borrower's default. It provides an estimation of the exposure that cannot be recovered in a default event and therefore captures the severity of a loss. Conceptually, LGD estimates are independent of a borrower's probability of default. The LGD models applied in Stages 1 and 2, which are based on regulatory LGD models, but adjusted for IFRS 9 requirements (i.e., removal of downturn-add-on and removal of indirect costs of workout), ensure that the main drivers for losses (i.e., different levels and quality of collateralization and customer or product types or seniority of facility) are reflected as risk drivers in LGD estimates. In the bank's LGD models, the Group assigns collateral type specific LGD parameters to the collateralized exposure (collateral value after application of haircuts). The LGD setting for defaulted homogeneous portfolios are partially dependent on time after default and are either calibrated based on the Group's multi-decade loss and recovery experience using statistical methods or for less significant portfolios certain LGD model input parameters (e.g., cure rates) are determined by expert judgement.",

        "page_content": "The third key input factor is the exposure at default over the lifetime of a financial asset which is modelled taking into account expected repayment profiles (e.g., linear amortization, annuities, bullet loan structures). Prepayment options are modelled for some portfolios. The bank applies specific credit conversion factors (CCFs) in order to calculate an EAD value. Conceptually, the EAD is defined as the expected amount of the credit exposure to a borrower at the time of its default. In instances where a transaction involves an unused limit, a percentage share of this unused limit is added to the outstanding amount in order to appropriately reflect the expected outstanding amount in case of a borrower's default. This reflects the assumption that for commitments, the utilization at the time of default might be higher than the current outstanding balance. In case a transaction involves an additional contingent component (i.e., guarantees) a further percentage share is applied as part of the CCF model in order to estimate the amount of guarantees drawn in case of default. The calibrations of such parameters are based on internal historical data and are either based on empirical analysis or supported by expert judgement and consider borrower and product type specifics. Where supervisory CCF values need to be applied for regulatory purposes, internal estimates are used for IFRS 9.\n\n## Expected Lifetime\n\nIFRS 9 requires the determination of lifetime ECL for which the expected lifetime of a financial asset is a key input factor. Lifetime ECL represent default events over the expected life of a financial asset. The Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower's extension options) over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nRetail overdrafts, credit card facilities and certain corporate revolving facilities typically include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component. The expected lifetime of such on-demand facilities exceeds their contractual life as they are typically cancelled only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk. The expected lifetime is estimated by taking into consideration historical information and the Group's credit risk management actions such as credit limit reductions and facility cancellation. Where such facilities are subject to an individual review by credit risk management, the lifetime for calculating ECL is 12 months. For facilities not subject to individual review by credit risk management, the bank applies a lifetime for calculating ECL of 24 months.\n\n## Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model\n\nIn the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the effective interest rate (EIR), which is usually the contractual interest rate. The contractual interest rate is deemed to be an appropriate approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the ECL and does not materially differ from the EIR.\n\n## Consideration of Collateralization in IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Calculation\n\nThe ECL model projects the level of collateralization for each point in time in the life of a financial asset. At the reporting date, the model uses the existing collateral distribution process applied in Deutsche Bank's economic capital model. In this model, the liquidation value of each eligible collateral is allocated to relevant financial assets to distinguish between collateralized and uncollateralized parts of each financial asset. In the ECL calculation, the Group subsequently applies the aforementioned LGDs for secured and unsecured exposures to derive the ECL for the secured and unsecured part of the exposure separately.\n\nFor personal collateral (e.g., guarantees), the ECL model assumes that the relative level of collateralization remains stable over time. In the case of an amortizing loan, the outstanding exposure and collateral values decrease together over time. For physical collateral (e.g., real estate property), the ECL shall assume that the absolute collateral value remains constant. In case of  an  amortizing  loan,  the  collateralized  part  of  the  exposure  increases  over  time  and  the  loan-to-value  decreases accordingly.\n\nCertain financial guarantee contracts are integral to the financial assets guaranteed. In such cases, the financial guarantee is considered as collateral for the financial asset and the benefit of the guarantee is used to mitigate the ECL of the guaranteed financial asset.",

        "page_content": "## Forward Looking Information\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the allowance for credit losses is based on reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available without undue cost or effort, which takes into consideration past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nTo incorporate forward looking information into the Group's allowance for credit losses, the bank uses two key elements:\n\n- -As its base scenario, the Group uses external survey-based macroeconomic forecasts (e.g. consensus views on GDP and unemployment rates); in addition, the scenario expansion model, which has been initially developed for stress testing, is used for forecasting macroeconomic variables that are not covered by external consensus data; all forecasts are assumed to reflect the most likely development of the respective variables; the Group regularly updates its forecasts for macroeconomic factors during the quarter and reviews aspects of potential model imprecision (e.g., MEV parameters outside the historic range used for model calibration, if not already included in the model) as part of an MEV monitoring framework to assess if an overlay is required.\n- -Statistical  techniques  are  then  applied  to  transform  the  base  scenario  projections  into  a  probability  distribution  of  the macroeconomic variables; these scenarios specify deviations from the baseline forecasts; the scenario distribution is then used for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are applied in the ECL calculation and in the identification of significant deterioration in credit quality of financial assets as described above in the ratingrelated Stage 2 indicators\n\nThe Group's Risk and Finance Credit Loss Provision Forum monitors the impact of forward-looking information, including the latest macroeconomic variables, on a quarterly basis and determines if any additional overlays are required. Although interest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs, the economic impact of these risks is reflected in GDP growth rates,  unemployment,  equities  and  credit  spreads  as  higher  rates  and  inflation  filter  through  these  forecasts.  As  of December 31, 2023, the consensus data applied in the ECL model was deemed to have reflected the latest macroeconomic developments and after considering all relevant uncertainties in the MEVs no additional overlays were required.\n\nAs described earlier, the Group's approach to reflect macroeconomic variables in the calculation of ECLs is to incorporate forecasts for the next two years, using eight discrete quarterly observations. After the period of eight quarters, the Group constructs forecasts based on macro-economic variables and its historic trends.\n\nThe tables below contain the macroeconomic variables included in the application of forward-looking information in the IFRS 9 model as of December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Focus areas in 2023\n\nDeutsche Bank's macroeconomic environment in 2023 was characterized by the persistently high inflation which drove further monetary tightening, risks of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major advanced  economies.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  evidence  of  waning  inflation  pressure  led  to  a  repricing  of  market expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial conditions.  In  addition,  there  were  episodes  of  significant  market  volatility  particularly  around  selective  failures  and/or restructurings in the U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) market, particularly in the U.S. office sector.\n\nTo ensure that Deutsche Bank's ECL model was taking into account the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment throughout 2023, the Group reviewed emerging risks to assess its potential downside and to manage the bank's credit strategy and risk appetite on an ongoing basis. Overall, Deutsche Bank believes the actions taken as a result of these reviews were designated to ensure the bank was adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate\n\nCRE markets continue to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates, decreasing market liquidity combined with tightened lending conditions, and structural changes in the office sector.\n\nThe market stress has been more pronounced in the U.S. where property price indices point to a greater decline of CRE asset values from recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Similarly, within the office segment, the market weakness is most evident in the U.S., reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe.\n\nIn the current environment, the main risk for the portfolio is refinancing risk. CRE loans often have a significant portion of their principal amount payable at maturity. Under current market conditions, borrowers may have difficulty obtaining a new loan to repay the maturing debt or fulfil conditions to extend the loan. The Group is closely monitoring its CRE portfolio for indications of elevated refinancing risk.\n\nAmidst interest rate hikes commencing in 2022 and real estate market stress increasing, the Group has proactively worked with borrowers to address upcoming maturities to establish terms for loan amendments and extensions (e.g. extensions of terms) which in many cases, are classified as forbearance triggering Stage 2 classification under IFRS, but are not always modifications according under IFRS. However, in certain cases, no agreement can be reached on loan extensions or loan amendments, and the borrower's inability to obtain refinancing leads to a default. This has resulted in higher Stage 3 ECL for 2023 compared to 2022, and there is continued uncertainty with respect to future defaults and the timing of a recovery in the CRE markets.\n\nThe CRE portfolio consists of lending arrangements originated across various parts of the Group and client segments. The Group's  CRE  portfolio  under  the  Group's  CRE  definition  includes  exposures  reported  under  the  Main  Credit  Exposure Categories by Industry Sectors for Real Estate Activities NACE but also exposures reported under other NACE classifications including Financial and Insurance Activities.\n\nWithin the CRE portfolio, the Group differentiates between recourse and non-recourse financing. Recourse CRE financings typically have a lower inherent risk profile based on recourse to creditworthy entities or individuals, in addition to mortgage collateral. Recourse CRE exposures range from secured recourse lending for business or commercial properties to property companies, Wealth Management clients, as well as other private and corporate clients.\n\nNon-recourse financings rely on sources of repayment that are typically limited to the cash flows generated by the financed property and the ability to refinance such loans may be constrained by the underlying property value and income stream generated by such property at the time of refinancing.\n\nThe entire CRE loan portfolio is subject to periodic stress testing under Deutsche Bank's Group Wide Stress Test Framework. In addition, Deutsche Bank uses bespoke portfolio stress testing for certain sub-segments of the CRE loan portfolio to obtain a more comprehensive view of potential downside risks. For the year ending December 31, 2023, the Group performed a bespoke portfolio stress test on a subset of the non-recourse financing portfolio deemed higher risk based on its heightened sensitivity  to  current  CRE  market  stress  factors,  including  higher  interest  rates,  declining  collateral  values  and  elevated refinancing risk due to loan structures with a high proportion of their outstanding principal balance payable at maturity.",

LTV calculations are based on latest externally appraised values which are additionally subject to regular interim internal adjustments.  While  the  Group  is  updating  CRE  collateral  values  where  applicable,  such  values  and  their  underlying assumptions are subject to a higher degree of fluctuation and uncertainty in the current environment of heightened market volatility and reduced market liquidity. A continuation of the current stressed market conditions could have a further adverse impact on commercial real estate property values and LTV ratios.\n\nStage classification and provisioning levels are primarily based on the Group's assessment of a borrower's ability to generate recurring cash flows, its ability to obtain refinancing at the loan's maturity, and an assessment of the financed property's collateral value. Deutsche Bank actively monitors these factors for potential signs of deterioration to ensure timely adjustment of  the  borrower's  loan  classifications.  When  a  loan  is  deemed  to  be  impaired,  the  Group  calculates  required  credit  loss provisions  using  multiple  potential  scenarios  for  loan  resolution,  weighted  by  their  expected  probabilities  and  taking  into account information available at that point. Such assessments are inherently subjective with respect to scenario weightings and subject to various assumptions, including future cash flows generated by a property and potential property liquidation proceeds. These assumptions are subject to uncertainties which are exacerbated in the current volatile market environment such  that  deviating  developments  to  initial  assumptions  could  have  a  material  future  impact  on  calculated  provisions. Additional uncertainty exists within the office sector due to the uncertain long-term impact of remote working arrangements on demand for office space.\n\nGiven the near-term outlook for interest rates, the Group expects stressed market conditions to continue into 2024 which could result in further deterioration of asset quality and higher credit loss provisions, which is reflected in the communicated guidance on credit loss provisions for 2024.",

        "page_content": "Since the onset of the CRE market deterioration, the Group aims to assess the downside risk of additional credit losses in its higher risk non-recourse portfolio through a temporary bespoke stress testing focused on stressing property values as main driver  of  loss  severity.  Stressed  values  are  derived  by  applying  an  observed  peak-to-trough  market  index  decline  (a commercial property value market index to the appraised values) plus an additional haircut, differentiated by property type and region. Implying a liquidation scenario, the stress analysis assumes a loss to occur on a loan when the stressed property value is less than the outstanding loan balance, i.e., the stress LTV beyond 100%. For the stress analysis performed as of December 31, 2023 the Group applied haircuts ranging from 3%-18% on top of the observed peak-to-trough market index decline for each property type. Driven by further deterioration of market conditions especially in the U.S. office sector, the index decline in the fourth quarter increased further compared to the prior quarter.\n\nBased on the stress test assumptions and utilizing the December 31, 2023 stress-tested CRE portfolio of \u20ac 31.2 billion as jump-off point, the stress scenario could result in approximately \u20ac 1.1 billion of credit losses over multiple years based on the respective maturity profile. The stress loss is reported gross of allowance, however, it should be noted that it covers a portfolio, where the Group has already a credit loss allowance in place. Nevertheless, the stress loss under a liquidation scenario could exceed the current ECL estimate.\n\nThe bespoke stress test has numerous limitations, including but not limited to lack of differentiation based on individual asset performance, specific  location  or  asset  desirability,  all  of  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  potential  stress  losses. Furthermore,  calculated  stress  losses  are  sensitive  to  potential  further  deterioration  of  peak-to-trough  index  values  and assumptions about incremental haircuts, incremental stress loss can therefore change going forward. Changes in underlying assumptions could lead to a wider range of stress results and hence the Group's bespoke stress approach is one of multiple scenarios.\n\nBased on currently available information, Deutsche Bank believes that the ECL estimate related to the Group's CRE portfolio is within reasonable ranges, requires no additional corrective measure and thus represents the bank's best estimate. However, the Group remains highly selective around new business, focusing on more resilient property types such as industrial or logistics.\n\n## Overall Assessment of ECL's\n\nTo ensure that Deutsche Bank's ECL model accounted for the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment throughout 2023, the Group continued to review emerging risks, assessed potential baseline and downside impacts and required actions to manage the bank's credit strategy and risk appetite. The outcome of these reviews concluded that the bank adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n\nResults from the above reviews and development of key portfolio indicators are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk Appetite and Management Forum and Group Risk Committee. Where necessary, actions and measures are taken to mitigate the risks. Client ratings are regularly reviewed to reflect the latest macroeconomic developments and where potentially significant risks are identified clients are moved to the watchlist (Stage 2), forbearance measures may be negotiated, and credit limits and collateralization are reviewed. Overall, the Group believes that based on its day-to-day risk management activities and regular reviews of emerging risks it has adequately provided for its ECL.\n\nHowever, the section below further considers whether any additional overlays were required as of year end 2023.\n\n## Management overlays applied to the IFRS 9 model output\n\nThe Group regularly reviews the IFRS 9 methodology and processes, key inputs into the ECL calculation and discusses upcoming model changes, potential model imprecisions or other estimation uncertainties, for example in the macroeconomic environment to determine if any material overlays are required.\n\nIn 2023 the \u20ac 92 million overlay related to parameter recalibrations required due to the new definition of default has been released (which at first application led to a decrease of Allowance for Credit Losses). This overlay was introduced in 2021, when the Group implemented the new definition of default which is the trigger for Stage 3. The implementation of the new definition of default mainly affected the Private Bank, where the Stage 3 population in homogeneous portfolios increased. As the change in definition does not materially impact the total loss expectation of these portfolios, this change resulted in an overstatement of Stage 3 provisions as related PD and LGD parameters were not updated in the model.\n\nThe envisaged PD and LGD recalibrations took place in the second half of 2023 after additional empirical data was available to enable the statistical recalibration and led to the expected parameter updates. The overall net recalibration effect including offsetting impact from the release of the overlay amounted to \u20ac 15 million.",

        "page_content": "For year end 2022, the Group recorded overlays amounting to in total \u20ac (92) million (which led to an decrease of Allowance for Credit Losses) versus \u20ac 84 million for year end 2023 (which led to an increase of Allowance for Credit Losses), mainly in relation to envisaged ECL model changes planned for implementation in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn assessing whether the Group requires any additional overlays, it regularly reviews for evolving or emerging risks, especially in the current geopolitical environment. Similar to the measures included above in the Focus areas in 2023, these measures include client surveys and interviews, along with analysis of portfolios across businesses, regions and sectors. In addition, the Group regularly reviews and validates key model inputs and assumptions (including those in feeder models) and ensures where expert judgement is applied, it is in line with the Group's risk management framework. As of December 31, 2023, the Group did not identify any model weaknesses that would require an additional overlay, except for the ECL model related changes, for which overlays have been recorded.\n\n## Model Sensitivity\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  three  key  model  assumptions  included  in  the  IFRS  9  model.  These  include  forward  looking macroeconomic variables, the quantitative criteria for determining if a borrower has incurred a significant increase in credit risk and transferred to Stage 2, and the LGD setting on homogenous portfolios in Stage 3. Below the bank provides sensitivity analysis on the potential impact if these key assumptions applied in the ECL model were to deviate from the bank's base case expectations.\n\n## Macroeconomic Variables\n\nThe sensitivity of the ECL model with respect to potential changes in projections for key MEVs is shown in the tables below, which provides ECL impacts for Stages 1 and 2 from one sigma downward and upward shifts applied separately to each group of  MEV as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. A sigma shift is a standard deviation used in statistics and probability calculations and is a measure of the dispersion of the values of a random variable. Each of these groups consists of MEVs from the same category:\n\n- -GDP growth rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Developing Asia, Emerging Markets\n- -Unemployment rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain\n- -Equities: S&P500, Nikkei, MSCI Asia\n- -Credit spreads: ITX Europe 125, High Yield Index, CDX IG, CDX High Yield, CDX Emerging Markets\n- -Real Estate: Commercial Real Estate Price Index\n- -Commodities: WTI oil price, Gold price\n\nAlthough interest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs above, the economic impact of these risks is reflected in other macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth rates, unemployment, equities and credit spreads as higher rates and inflation would filter through these forecasts and be included in the ECL model and sensitivity analysis below.\n\nIn addition, the sensitivity analysis only includes the impact of the aggregated MEV group (i.e., potential correlation between different MEV groups or the impact of management overlays is not taken into consideration). ECLs for Stage 3 are not affected and not reflected in the following tables as its calculation is independent of the macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nSensitivity impact is lower as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, due to portfolio changes and minor improvements of base MEV projections which the analyses were based on.",

If for all Stage 1 borrowers Deutsche Bank were to record lifetime expected credit losses, the Group's allowance for credit losses amounting to \u20ac 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \u20ac 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately 38% as of year end 2023 and as of yearend 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stage 3 LGD setting\n\nThe Group's allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 for the homogeneous portfolios amounts to \u20ac 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \u20ac 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The key driver in determining the ECL provision is the loss given default estimate, which differs by individual portfolios. Loss given default is influenced by recovery rates, proceeds from the sale of collateral, and cure rates. Some of the drivers for different portfolios include elements of expert judgment and in particular on expected cure rates. If the LGD for all homogeneous portfolios were to increase by 1%, then Stage 3 ECL would increase as of December 31, 2023 by approximately \u20ac 22 million (thereof \u20ac 14 million in Germany, \u20ac 5 million in Italy and \u20ac 2 million in Spain), and by approximately \u20ac 19 million as of December 31, 2022 (thereof \u20ac 11 million in Germany, \u20ac 5 million in Italy and \u20ac 2 million in Spain).",

        "page_content": "## IFRS 9 Model results\n\nIn 2023, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.5 billion, compared to \u20ac 1.2 billion recorded for the year ended 2022. The increase is reflecting an overall weakened macroeconomic environment with only slow recovery of the main economies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as well as increased challenges for the Commercial Real Estate sector especially in the office space which was already affected by a post-Covid driven change in demand. This sector came under further pressure by monetary  measures  imposed  by  the  central  banks  in  reply  to  increased  inflation  which  subsequently  led  to  increased refinancing risks.\n\nThe total provisions in 2023 include a \u20ac 51 million release related to clients in Russia and Ukraine as a result of successful de-risking activities compared to a \u20ac 114 million increase in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, \u20ac 33 million releases of provision for credit losses related to Stage 1 and 2 and \u20ac 1.5 billion new provision for credit losses to Stage 3, this compares to \u20ac 204 million provisions of Stage 1 and 2 provisions and \u20ac 1.0 billion in Stage 3 in 2022. The reduction of Stage 1 and 2 provisions was primarily driven by the improvement and stabilization of macroeconomic parameters after the macroeconomic outlook significantly deteriorated in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as benefits from a one-time model change. The increase of Stage 3 provisions was affecting all businesses but primarily the Private Bank and the Investment Bank.\n\nCorporate Bank recorded provision for credit losses of \u20ac 266 million in 2023 versus a \u20ac 335 million in 2022. The year on year decrease was primarily driven by Stage 1 and 2 releases in 2023 compared to charges observed in 2022 following an improved macro-economic outlook and benefits from model related changes. This was partly offset  by  moderately higher  Stage 3 provisions compared to the prior year across various portfolios. The Investment Bank recorded an increase of provision for credit losses of \u20ac 431 million in 2023 versus \u20ac 319 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by an increased number of impairments primarily in Commercial Real Estate. The Private Bank recorded an increase of provisions for credit losses of \u20ac 783 million in 2023 versus \u20ac 583 million reported in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by Stage 3 provisions in the first quarter of 2023 due to single name cases in Wealth Management and in the fourth quarter 2023 due to the reversal of the \u20ac 92 million overlay related to parameter recalibrations required due to the new definition of default introduced in 2021.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the allowance for credit losses in relation to climate-related risks are deemed to be immaterial at the end of December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFor details on the Group's accounting policy related to IFRS 9 Impairment, please refer to Note 1 - Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Exposure to Russia\n\nDeutsche Bank continues to have limited exposure to Russia. The following table provides an overview of total Russian exposures, including overnight deposits with the Central Bank of Russia in the amount of \u20ac 0.6 billion as of December 31, 2023  (\u20ac 0.8 billion  as  of  December  31,  2022)  and  other  receivables,  which  are  subject  to  IFRS  9  impairment,  and correspondent allowance for credit losses by stages as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n\n## Breakdown of total exposure and allowance for credit losses by stages\n\n|         | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023                   | Dec 31, 2023                     | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022                   | Dec 31, 2022                     |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m. | Total Exposure | Allowance for  Credit Losses 1 | Total collateral  and guarantees | Total Exposure | Allowance for  Credit Losses 1 | Total collateral  and guarantees |\n| Stage 1 | 93             | 0                              | 24                               | 209            | 0                              | 59                               |\n| Stage 2 | 797            | 4                              | 270                              | 1,182          | 10                             | 375                              |\n| Stage 3 | 325            | 16                             | 261                              | 336            | 68                             | 152                              |\n| Total   | 1,215          | 20                             | 555                              | 1,726          | 79                             | 586                              |\n\n- 1 Allowance for credit losses do not include allowance for country risk amounting to \u20ac 3 million as of December 31, 2023 and \u20ac 11 million as of December 31, 2022\n\nTotal exposure of \u20ac 1.2 billion (\u20ac 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022) consists of \u20ac 0.5 billion (\u20ac 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) loan exposure to Russia, \u20ac 26 million (\u20ac 78 million as of December 31, 2022) of undrawn commitments and \u20ac 0.6 billion (\u20ac 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) of unsecured overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia (which continues to be reflected in Stage 2 as of December 31, 2023); the residual unsecured exposure, excluding the unsecured overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia, is mainly driven by loans with large Russian companies. Not included in these exposures are Deutsche Bank's interests in its Russian consolidated entities.

primarily due to the increases in debt securities held to collect as well as loans at amortized cost in Investment Bank and Private Bank, partly offset by a reduction in central bank balances.\n\nStage 2 exposures increased by \u20ac 5 billion or 12%, largely driven by loans at amortized cost in Private Bank due to the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment.\n\nStage 3 exposures slightly decreased by \u20ac 203 million or 2% in 2022, driven by reductions in Private Bank and the POCI loan portfolio.

The immaterial amount of net outflows from stage 3 due to creditworthiness in 2023 resulted from a release of an overlay, as mentioned above.",

Renegotiation or modification may or may not lead to derecognition of the old and recognition of the new financial instrument. This section covers modified financial assets that have not been derecognized.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, when the terms of a Financial Asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). For modified financial assets the determination of whether the asset's credit risk has increased significantly reflects the comparison of:\n\n- -The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with\n- -The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and based on the original contractual terms.\n\nThe following table provides the overview of modified financial assets at amortized cost in the reporting periods broken down into IFRS 9 stages.\n\n## Modified Assets at Amortized Cost\n\n|                                                       | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                               | Stage 1        | Stage 2        | Stage 3        | Stage 3  POCI  | Total          | Stage 1        | Stage 2        | Stage 3        | Stage 3  POCI  | Total          |\n| Amortized cost carrying amount prior to  modification | 0              | 1,072          | 220            | 0              | 1,292          | 0              | 0              | 47             | 0              | 47             |\n| Net modification gain/losses recognized               | 0              | 5              | (40)           | 0              | (35)           | 0              | (0)            | (6)            | 0              | (6)            |\n\nIn  2023,  the  bank  has  observed  the  increase  of  \u20ac 1.2 billion  in  modified  assets  at  amortized  cost  due  to  client  related modifications, driven by a single large client in Private Bank and the CRE portfolio in Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. The latter were granted with no modification loss.\n\nIn 2023, the Group has not observed any amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1. The bank has not observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into stages 2 and 3.\n\nIn 2022, the Group has observed immaterial amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1.

Allowance for credit losses against these assets remained at very low levels (\u20ac 48 million as of December 31, 2023 and \u20ac 69 million as of December 31, 2022). Due to immateriality no further breakdown is provided for financial assets at FVOCI.",

        "page_content": "## Legal Claims\n\nAssets subject to enforcement activity consist of assets, which have been fully or partially written off and the Group still continues to pursue recovery of the asset. Such enforcement activity comprises for example cases where the bank continues to devote resources (e.g. our Legal Department/CRM workout unit) towards recovery, either via legal channels or third party recovery agents. Enforcement activity also applies to cases where the Bank maintains outstanding and unsettled legal claims. This is irrespective of whether amounts are expected to be recovered and the recovery timeframe. It may be common practice in certain jurisdictions for recovery cases to span several years.\n\nAmounts outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to enforcement activity  amounted  to  \u20ac 334 million  in  fiscal  year  2023,  mainly  in  Corporate  Bank.  In  2022,  legal  claims  amounted  to \u20ac 175 million, mainly in Corporate Bank and Private Bank.\n\n## Renegotiated and forborne assets at amortized costs\n\nFor economic or legal reasons the bank might enter into a forbearance agreement with a borrower who faces or will face financial difficulties in order to ease the contractual obligation for a limited period of time. A case-by-case approach is applied for corporate clients considering each transaction and client-specific facts and circumstances. For consumer loans the bank offers forbearances for a limited period of time, in which the total or partial outstanding or future instalments are deferred to a later point of time. However, the amount not paid including accrued interest during this period must be re-compensated at a later  point  of  time.  Repayment  options  include  distribution  over  residual  tenor,  a  one-off  payment  or  a  tenor  extension. Forbearances are restricted and depending on the economic situation of the client, the Group's risk management strategies and the local legislation. In case a forbearance agreement is entered into, an impairment measurement is conducted as described below, an impairment charge is taken if necessary and the loan is subsequently recorded as impaired.\n\nIn  the  Group's management and reporting of forborne assets at amortized costs, the bank follows the EBA definition for forbearances and non-performing loans (Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Supervisory reporting on forbearance and non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013). Once the conditions mentioned in the ITS are met, the Group reports the loan as being forborne; removes the asset from the bank's forbearance reporting, once the discontinuance criteria in the ITS are met (i.e., the contract is considered as performing, a minimum two year probation period has passed, regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period, and none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due at the end of the probation period).\n\n## Forborne financial assets at amortized cost\n\n|            |         |                       | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023              | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023          | Dec 31, 2022  Total   | Dec 31, 2022  Total       | Dec 31, 2022  Total   | Dec 31, 2022  Total   |\n|------------|---------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.    | Stage 1 | Performing    Stage 2 | Stage 1        | Stage 2        | Non-performing    Stage 3 | cost           | Stage 1        | Performing    Stage 2 | Stage 1               | Non-performing    Stage 2 | Stage 3               | cost                  |\n| German     | 426     | 2,356                 | 0              | 7              | 812                       | 3,600          | 729            | 1,563                 | 0                     | 21                        | 1,066                 | 3,379                 |\n| Non-German | 639     | 4,399                 | 0              | 194            | 3,632                     | 8,864          | 1,254          | 3,139                 | 60                    | 13                        | 3,299                 | 7,764                 |\n| Total      | 1,065   | 6,755                 | 0              | 201            | 4,444                     | 12,464         | 1,983          | 4,702                 | 60                    | 34                        | 4,365     11,143      |                       |\n\n## Development of forborne financial assets at amortized cost\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                            | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Balance beginning of period                                        | 11,143         | 13,741         |\n| Classified as forborne during the year                             | 4,007          | 3,196          |\n| Transferred to non-forborne during the year (including repayments) | (2,500)        | (5,899)        |\n| Charge-offs                                                        | (80)           | (142)          |\n| Exchange rate and other movements                                  | (106)          | 248            |\n| Balance end of period                                              | 12,464         | 11,143         |\n\nForborne assets at amortized cost increased by \u20ac 1.3 billion, or 12% in 2023.

In 2023 and 2022, the Group obtained \u20ac 0 million of collateral related to these trusts.\n\n## Derivatives - Credit Valuation Adjustment\n\nThe bank establishes counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) for OTC derivative transactions to cover expected credit losses. The adjustment amount is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the credit risk, based on available market information, including CDS spreads.\n\n## Treatment of default situations under derivatives\n\nUnlike standard loan assets, the bank generally has more options to manage the credit risk in its derivatives transactions when movement in the current replacement costs or the behavior of its counterparty indicate that there is the risk that upcoming payment obligations under the transactions might not be honored. In these situations, the bank is frequently able under the relevant derivatives agreements to obtain additional collateral or to terminate and close-out the derivative transactions at short notice.\n\nThe master agreements and associated collateralization agreements for OTC derivative transactions executed with its clients typically result in the majority of its credit exposure being secured by collateral. It also provides for a broad set of standard or bespoke termination rights, which allows the bank to respond swiftly to a counterparty's default or to other circumstances which indicate a high probability of failure.\n\nThe  banks  contractual  termination  rights  are  supported  by  internal  policies  and  procedures  with  defined  roles  and responsibilities  which  ensure that potential counterparty defaults are identified and addressed in a timely fashion. These procedures include necessary settlement and trading restrictions. When its decision to terminate derivative transactions results in a residual net obligation owed by the counterparty, the bank restructures the obligation into a non-derivative claim and manage it through its regular work-out process. As a consequence, for accounting purposes the bank typically does not show any nonperforming derivatives.\n\nWrong-way risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. In compliance with Article 291(2) and (4) CRR the bank has a monthly process to monitor several layers of wrong-way risk (specific wrong-way risk, general explicit wrong-way risk at country/industry/region levels and general implicit wrong-way risk, whereby relevant exposures arising from transactions subject to wrong-way risk are automatically selected and presented for comment to the responsible credit officer). A wrong-way risk report is then sent to Credit Risk senior management on a monthly basis. In addition, the bank utilized its established process for calibrating its own alpha factor (as defined in Article 284 (9) CRR) to estimate the overall wrong-way risk in its derivatives and securities financing transactions portfolio. The Private Bank Germany's derivative counterparty risk is immaterial to the Group and collateral held is typically in the form of cash.",

        "page_content": "## Managing and mitigation of credit risk\n\n## Managing credit risk on counterparty level\n\nCredit-relevant counterparties are principally allocated to credit officers within credit teams which are organized by type of counterparty (such as financial institutions, corporates or private individuals), economic area (e.g., emerging markets) or product and supported by dedicated rating analyst teams where deemed necessary. The individual credit officers have the relevant expertise and experience to manage the credit risks associated with these counterparties and their associated credit related transactions. For retail clients, credit decision making and credit monitoring is highly automated due to standardized products and processes. Credit Risk Management has full oversight of the respective processes and tools used in these highly automated retail credit processes. It is the responsibility of each credit officer to undertake ongoing credit monitoring for their allocated counterparties. Deutsche Bank also has procedures in place intended to identify at an early-stage credit exposures for which there may be an increased risk of deteriorated risk/ loss.\n\nIn instances where Deutsche Bank has identified counterparties with emerging concern about their credit quality deteriorating or likely to deteriorate to the point where they present a heightened risk of default / loss, the respective counterparty is generally placed on the 'Watchlist'. Deutsche Bank aims to identify those counterparties at an early stage to ensure that credit exposures with increased risks are effectively managed, the Bank's risk management tools are appropriately applied aiming to minimize potential losses. The objective of this early warning system is to address potential problems while adequate options for action are still available. This early risk detection is a tenet of Deutsche Bank's credit culture and is designed to raise management awareness of these positions.\n\nCredit limits for individual counterparties are established by the Credit Risk Management function applying credit authorities assigned to individual Credit Officers. This also applies to settlement risk that must fall within limits pre-approved by Credit Risk Management and in a manner that reflects expected settlement patterns for the subject counterparty. Credit approvals are documented by electronic signature under 4-eye principle by the respective credit authority holders and are retained for future reference.\n\nCredit authority is generally assigned as a personal credit authority according to the individual's professional qualification and experience. All assigned credit authorities are reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they are commensurate with the individual performance of the authority holder.\n\nWhere credit authority is insufficient to establish required credit limits, the transaction is referred to a credit authority holder with the respective credit authority or if exceeding the highest personal authority to an appropriate credit committee. Where personal and committee authorities are insufficient to establish appropriate limits, the case is referred to the Management Board for approval.\n\n## Mitigation of credit risk on counterparty level\n\nIn addition to determine counterparty credit quality by assigning internal ratings and the alignment of the exposure with the Bank's  counterparty  concentration  risk  guidelines,  Deutsche  Bank  also  uses  various  credit  risk  mitigation  &  protection techniques to optimize credit exposure and reduce potential credit losses. These techniques are applied in the following forms:\n\n- -Comprehensive and enforceable credit documentation with adequate terms and conditions\n- -Collateral  in  its  various  forms  to  reduce  losses  by  increasing  the  recovery  of  obligations;  key  principles  for  collateral management include legal effectiveness and enforceability, prudent and realistic collateral valuations, risk and regulatory capital reduction, as well as cost efficiency\n- -Risk transfers, which shift the risk of default of an obligor to a third-party including hedging executed by the bank's Strategic Corporate Lending (SCL) team or entity; other de-risking tools, such as securitizations etc., may also be employed\n- -Netting and collateral arrangements which reduce the credit exposure from derivatives and securities financing transactions (e.g. repo transactions)\n- -Hedging of derivatives counterparty risk including CVA, using primarily CDS contracts via the bank's Counterparty Portfolio Management desk",

        "page_content": "## Collateral\n\nDeutsche Bank regularly agrees on collateral to be received from customers that are subject to credit risk or to be provided by third parties agreed by legally effective and enforceable contracts as documented by a written and reasoned legal opinion. Collateral is credit protection in the form of (funded) assigned or pledged assets or (unfunded) third-party obligations that serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either substituting the counterparty default risk or improving recoveries in the event of a default. Deutsche Bank generally takes all types of eligible collateral for its respective businesses but may limit accepted collateral types for specific businesses or regions as customary in the respective market or driven by purpose of efficiency. While collateral can be an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the necessity of highquality  underwriting  standards  and  a  thorough  assessment  of  the  debt  service  ability  of  the  counterparty  in  line  with Article 194 (9) CRR.\n\nDeutsche Bank distinguishes the following two types of credit protection approaches:\n\n- -Funded Credit Protection like financial and other collateral, which enables Deutsche Bank to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral / asset provided, in cases where the counterparty is unable or unwilling to fulfill its primary obligations. Cash collateral, securities (equity, bonds), collateral pledges or assignments of other claims or inventory, movable assets (i.e., plant, machinery, ships and aircraft) and real estate typically fall into this category; all financial collateral is regularly, mostly daily, revalued and measured against the respective credit exposure; the value of other collateral, including real estate, is monitored based upon established processes that includes regular reviews or revaluations by internal and/or external experts\n- -Unfunded Credit Protection like Guarantees, which complement the counterparty's ability to fulfill its obligation under the legal contract and as such is provided by uncorrelated third parties. Letters of credit, insurance contracts, export credit insurance, guarantees, credit derivatives and (unfunded) risk participations typically fall into this category. Guarantees and strong letters of comfort provided by correlated group members of customers (generally the parent company) may also be accepted and considered in approved rating approaches; guarantee collateral with a non-investment grade rating of the guarantor is limited\n\nDeutsche Bank's processes seek to ensure that the collateral accepted for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality. This includes  processes  to  generally  ensure  legally  effective  and  enforceable  documentation  for  realizable  and  measurable collateral or assets which are evaluated within the on-boarding process by dedicated internal appraisers or teams with the respective qualification, skills and experience or adequate external valuers mandated in regulated processes. The applied valuations follow generally accepted valuation methods or models. Ongoing correctness of values is monitored by collateral type-specific, appropriately frequent, and event-driven reviews considering relevant risk parameters. Revaluations are applied in cases of identified probable material deterioration and future monitoring may be adjusted respectively. The assessment of the suitability of collateral for a specific transaction is part of the credit decision and must be undertaken in a conservative way, including collateral haircuts that are applied. Deutsche Bank has collateral type specific haircuts in place which are regularly reviewed and approved. In this regard, Deutsche Bank strives to avoid 'wrong-way' risk characteristics where the counterparty's risk is positively correlated with the risk of deterioration in the collateral value. For unfunded credit protection like guarantees, the process for the analysis of the guarantor's creditworthiness is aligned to the credit assessment process for credit-relevant counterparties.\n\nThe valuation of collateral is considered under a liquidation scenario. The liquidation value is equal to the expected proceeds of collateral monetization / realization in a base case scenario, wherein a fair price is achieved through careful preparation and orderly liquidation of the collateral. Collateral can either move in value over time (dynamic value) or not (static value). The dynamic  liquidation  value  generally  includes  a  safety  margin  or  haircut  over  realizable  value  to  address  liquidity  and marketability aspects.",

They also incorporate a forward-looking component in the form of collection and valuation forecast provided by experts within Risk Management. Considering the expected proceeds from the liquidation of the different collateral types, respective value fluctuations, market specific liquidation costs, and time applied haircuts vary between 0 to 100%. When data is not sufficiently available or inconclusive, more conservative haircuts than otherwise used must be applied. Haircut settings are reviewed at least annually.\n\n## Risk transfers\n\nRisk transfers to third parties form a key part of the bank's overall risk management process and are executed in various forms, including outright sales, single name and portfolio hedging, and securitizations. Risk transfers are conducted by the respective business units and/ or by Strategic Corporate Lending, in accordance with specifically approved mandates.\n\nStrategic Corporate Lending manages the residual credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments of the institutional and corporate credit portfolio, part of the leveraged lending portfolio and the medium-sized German companies' portfolio across the bank's Corporate Bank and Investment Bank divisions.\n\nActing as a central pricing reference, Strategic Corporate Lending provides the businesses with an observed or derived capital market rate for loan applications; however, the decision of whether or not the business can enter into the credit risk remains exclusively with Credit Risk Management.\n\nStrategic  Corporate  Lending  concentrates  on  two  primary  objectives  within  the  credit  risk  framework  to  enhance  risk management discipline, improve returns and use capital more efficiently:\n\n- -To reduce single-name credit risk concentrations within the credit portfolio and\n- -To manage credit exposures by utilizing techniques including loan sales, securitization via collateralized loan obligations, sub-participations and single-name and portfolio credit default swaps\n\n## Netting and collateral arrangements for derivatives and securities financing transactions\n\nNetting is applicable to both exchange traded derivatives and OTC derivatives. Netting is also applied to securities financing transactions (e.g. repurchase, securities lending and margin lending transactions) as far as documentation, structure and nature of the risk mitigation allow netting with the underlying credit risk in accordance with applicable law and the bank's Financial Contracts Netting and Collateral Policy and Procedures - Legal (collectively, 'Netting Policies'). While cross-product netting between derivatives and securities financing transactions may be used in certain cases, the bank does not make use of cross-product netting for regulatory purposes.\n\nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), which interpose themselves between the trading entities by becoming the counterparty to each of the entities. Where legally required or where available and to the extent agreed with the bank's counterparties, Deutsche Bank also uses CCP clearing for its OTC derivative transactions.",

        "page_content": "The Dodd-Frank Act and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules require CCP clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps, subject to limited exceptions when facing certain counterparties. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives,  Central  Counterparties  and  Trade  Repositories  (EMIR)  and  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulations  (EU) 2015/2205, (EU) 2015/592 and (EU) 2016/1178 based thereupon introduced mandatory CCP clearing in the EU for certain standardized OTC derivatives transactions. Mandatory CCP clearing in the EU began for certain interest rate derivatives on June 21, 2016 and for certain iTraxx-based credit derivatives and additional interest rate derivatives on February 9, 2017. Article  4  (2)  of  EMIR  authorizes  competent  authorities  to  exempt  intragroup  transactions  from  mandatory  CCP  clearing, provided certain requirements, such as full consolidation of the intragroup transactions and the application of an appropriate centralized  risk  evaluation,  measurement  and  control  procedure  are  met.  The  bank  successfully  applied  for  the  clearing exemption for a number of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives, including e.g., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. As of December 31, 2023, the bank is allowed to make use of intragroup exemptions from the EMIR clearing obligation for 58 bilateral intragroup relationships. The extent of the exemptions differs as not all entities enter into relevant transaction types subject to the clearing obligation. Of the 58 intragroup relationships, 14 are relationships where both entities are established in the Union (EU) for which a full exemption has been granted, and 44 are relationships where one is established in a third country ('Third Country Relationship'). Third Country Relationships required repeat applications for each new asset class being subject to the clearing obligation; the process took place in the course of 2017. Due to 'Brexit', the status of some group entities has changed from an EU entity to a third country entity, but there has been no impact for the bank in respect clearing exemptions.\n\nThe rules and regulations of CCPs typically provide for the bilateral set off of all amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency ('payment netting') thereby reducing the bank's settlement risk. Depending on the business model applied by the CCP, this payment netting applies either to all of the bank's derivatives cleared by the CCP or at least to those that form part of the same class of derivatives. Many CCPs' rules and regulations also provide for the termination, close-out and netting of  all  cleared  transactions  upon  the  CCP's  default  ('close-out  netting'),  which  reduces  the  bank's  credit  risk.  In  its  risk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche Bank believes that the relevant CCP's close-out netting provisions are legally valid and enforceable and have been approved in accordance with the bank's Netting Policies.\n\nIn order to reduce the credit risk resulting from OTC derivative transactions, where CCP clearing is not available, Deutsche Bank regularly seeks the execution of standard master agreements (such as master agreements for derivatives published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) or the German Master Agreement for Financial Derivative Transactions) with the bank's counterparties. A master agreement allows for the close-out netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative transactions that have been entered into under such a master agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty. Payment netting may be agreed from time to time with the  bank's counterparties  for  multiple  transactions  having  the  same  payment  dates  (e.g.,  foreign  exchange  transactions) pursuant to the terms of master agreements which can, reduce the bank's settlement risk. In its risk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche Bank has concluded that the master agreement is legally valid and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and the recognition of close-out netting has been approved in accordance with the bank's Netting Policies.\n\nDeutsche Bank also enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) to master agreements in order to further reduce the bank's derivatives-related credit risk. These annexes generally provide risk mitigation through periodic, usually daily, margining of the covered exposure. The CSAs also provide for the right to terminate the related derivative transactions upon the counterparty's failure to honor a margin call. As with netting, when Deutsche Bank believes the annex is enforceable, Deutsche Bank reflects this in its exposure measurement.\n\nCertain CSAs to master agreements provide for rating-dependent triggers, where additional collateral must be pledged if a party's rating is downgraded. Deutsche Bank also enters into master agreements that provide for an additional termination event upon a party's rating downgrade. These downgrade provisions in CSAs and master agreements usually apply to both parties  but  in  some  agreements  may  apply  to  Deutsche  Bank  only.  Deutsche  Bank  analyzes  and  monitors  its  potential contingent payment obligations resulting from a rating downgrade in its stress testing and liquidity coverage ratio approach for liquidity risk on an ongoing basis. For an assessment of the quantitative impact of a downgrading of the bank's credit rating please refer to table 'Stress Testing Results' in the section 'Liquidity Risk'.",

        "page_content": "The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules thereunder, including CFTC rule \u00a7 23.504, as well as EMIR and Commission Delegated Regulation based thereon, namely Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, introduced the mandatory use of master agreements and related CSAs, which must be executed prior to or contemporaneously with entering into an uncleared OTC derivative transaction. Certain documentation is also required by the U.S. margin rules adopted by U.S. prudential regulators. Under the U.S. prudential regulators' margin rules, Deutsche Bank is required to post and collect initial margin for its derivatives exposures with other derivatives dealers, as well as with the bank's counterparties that (a) are 'financial end users,' as that term is defined in the U.S. margin rules, and (b) have an average daily aggregate notional amount of uncleared swaps, uncleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps exceeding U.S.$ 8 billion in June, July and August of the previous calendar year. The U.S. margin rules additionally requires Deutsche Bank to post and collect variation margin for its derivatives with other derivatives dealers and certain financial end user counterparties. These margin requirements are subject to a U.S.$ 50 million threshold for initial margin, but no threshold for variation margin, with a combined U.S.$ 500,000 minimum transfer amount. The U.S. margin requirements have been in effect for large banks since September 2016, with additional variation margin requirements having come into effect March 1, 2017 and additional initial margin requirements having been phased in from September 2017 through September 2022.\n\nUnder Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, which implements the EMIR margin requirements, the CSA must provide for daily valuation and daily variation margining based on a zero threshold and a minimum transfer amount of not more than \u20ac 500,000. For large derivative exposures exceeding \u20ac 8 billion, initial margin has to be posted as well. The variation margin requirements under EMIR apply as of March 1, 2017; the initial margin requirements originally were subject to a staged phase-in until September 1, 2021. However, legislative changes published on February 17, 2021 extended deadlines into 2022. Under Article 31 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, an EU party may decide to not exchange margin with counterparties in certain non-netting jurisdictions provided certain requirements are met. Pursuant to Article 11 (5) to (10) of  EMIR, competent authorities are authorized to exempt intragroup transactions from the margining obligation, provided certain requirements are met. While some of those requirements are the same as for the EMIR clearing exemptions (see above), there are additional requirements such as the absence of any current or foreseen practical or legal impediment to the prompt  transfer  of  funds  or  repayment  of  liabilities  between  intragroup  counterparties.  The  bank  is  making  use  of  this exemption. The bank has successfully applied for the collateral exemption for some of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with  intragroup  derivatives,  including,  e.g.,  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  and  Deutsche  Bank  Luxembourg  S.A.  As  of December 31, 2023, the bank is allowed to use intragroup exemptions from the EMIR collateral obligation for a number of bilateral  intragroup  relationships  which  are  published  under  db.com/legal-resources/european-market-infrastructureregulation/intra-group-exemptions-margining. For some bilateral intragroup relationships, the EMIR margining exemption may be used based on Article 11 (5) of EMIR, i.e. without the need for any application or publication, because both entities are established in the same EU Member State. For third country subsidiaries, the intragroup exemption was originally limited until the earlier of June 30, 2022 and four months after the publication of an equivalence decision by the EU Commission under Article 13(2) EMIR, unless, in the case of an equivalence decision being applicable, a follow-up exemption application is made and granted. On February 13, 2023, an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 has been published in the Official Journal, which amendment relates to the extension of the exemption end date until June 30, 2025. While the application requirement may be abolished with 'EMIR 3.0' (see European Commission proposal COM (2022) 697 final), Deutsche Bank continues to have processes in place ensuring readiness for intragroup margining should the need arise.\n\n## Concentrations within credit risk mitigation\n\nConcentrations within credit risk mitigations taken may occur if a number of guarantors and credit derivative providers with similar  economic  characteristics  are  engaged  in  comparable  activities  with  changes  in  economic  or  industry  conditions affecting their ability to meet contractual obligations. Concentration risk may also occur in collateral portfolios (e.g. multiple claims and receivables against third parties) which are considered conservatively within the valuation process and / or on-site inspections where applicable. Deutsche Bank uses a range of tools and metrics to monitor its credit risk mitigating activities and potential concentrations.\n\nFor more qualitative and quantitative details in relation to the application of credit risk mitigation and potential concentration effects please refer to the section 'Maximum exposure to credit risk'.",

        "page_content": "## Managing credit risk on portfolio level\n\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) Portfolio sets the framework for the management of concentration risks at a portfolio level. This includes strategically setting, monitoring, reviewing, reporting, and controlling credit risk appetites across various dimensions such as group, division, business unit, legal entity, branch, country, and industry level that need to be considered in the context of credit approvals. In addition, ERM Portfolio provides a comprehensive and holistic view of the bank's risk profile across risk types.\n\nOn a portfolio  level,  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  could  result  from  having  material  exposures  to  a  number  of counterparties with similar economic characteristics, or who are engaged in comparable activities, where these similarities may cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be affected in the same manner by changes in economic or industry conditions.\n\nDeutsche Bank's portfolio management framework supports a comprehensive assessment of concentrations within its credit risk portfolio in order to keep concentrations within acceptable levels.\n\nRisk and portfolio developments are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk Appetite and Portfolio Management Forum which includes representation from across the Credit Risk Management function including the Head of Credit Risk Management.\n\n## Industry risk management\n\nTo  manage  industry  risk,  Deutsche  Bank  has  grouped  its  corporate  and  financial  institutions  counterparties  into  various industry sub-portfolios. Portfolios are regularly reviewed at least on an annual basis. Reviews highlight industry developments and risks to the bank's credit portfolio, review cross-risk concentration risks, analyze the risk/reward profile of the portfolio and incorporate the results of an economic downside stress test. Finally, this analysis is used to define the credit strategies for the portfolio in question.\n\nIn the bank's industry risk management framework, thresholds are established for aggregate credit limits to counterparties within each industry sub-portfolio. For risk management purposes, the aggregation of limits across industry sectors follows an internal  risk  view  that  does  not  have  to  be  congruent  with  NACE  (Nomenclature  des  Activities  Economiques  dans  la Communate Europeenne) code-based view applied elsewhere in this report. Regular industry portfolio overviews are prepared for the Enterprise Risk Committee to discuss recent developments and to agree on risk management actions where necessary.\n\nBeyond credit risk, the bank's industry risk framework comprises of thresholds for Traded Credit Positions while key industry relevant non-financial risks are closely monitored.\n\n## Country risk management\n\nAvoiding  undue  concentrations  from  a  regional  and  country  perspective  is  also  an  integral  part  of  the  bank's  credit  risk management framework. In order to achieve this, country risk thresholds are applied to countries in Non-Japan Asia, Central Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America as well as selected Developed Markets countries (based on internal country risk ratings). Country portfolios are regularly reviewed with the frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and risk profile as well as risk developments. Larger / riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. These reviews assess amongst other factors, key macroeconomic and political risk developments and outlook; portfolio composition, quality and cross-risk concentrations under normal and stress conditions; analyze the risk / reward profile of the portfolio. Based on this and taking into account the Group's Risk Appetite and strategy, country risk appetite and strategies are set by ERM.\n\nIn the bank's country risk framework, thresholds are established for counterparty credit risk exposures in each country to manage the aggregate credit risk subject to country-specific economic and political events. These thresholds cover exposures to entities incorporated locally and subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations as well as companies with significant economic or operational dependence on a specific country even though they are incorporated externally. In addition, gap risk thresholds are set to control the risk of loss due to intra-country wrong-way risk exposure. As such, for risk management purposes, the aggregation of exposures across countries follows an internal risk view that may differ from the geographical exposure view applied elsewhere in this report. Beyond credit risk, the bank's country risk framework comprises thresholds for trading positions that measure the aggregate market value of traded credit risk positions. For Emerging Markets, thresholds are also set to measure the profit and loss impact under specific country stress scenarios on trading positions across the bank's portfolio. Furthermore, thresholds are set for capital and intra-group funding exposure of Deutsche Bank entities in above countries given the transfer risk inherent in these cross-border positions. Key non-financial risks are closely monitored and factored into financial threshold setting considerations where relevant. Deutsche Bank's country risk ratings represent a key tool in its management of country risk. They include:",

Specific risk limits are set in particular if a concentration of transactions of a specific type might lead to significant losses under certain conditions. In this respect, correlated losses might result from disruptions in the functioning of financial markets, significant moves in market parameters to which the respective product or asset class is sensitive to, or other risk drivers common to the asset class.\n\nPrivate Bank and certain Corporate Bank businesses are managed via product-specific strategies setting the bank's risk appetite for portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, such as the retail portfolios of mortgages and consumer finance products as well as products for business clients. Risk analyses are performed on portfolio level including further breakdown into business units as well as countries/regions. In Wealth Management, target levels are set for global concentrations along products as well as based on type and liquidity of collateral.\n\n## Underwriting of capital markets transactions\n\nSpecific focus is placed on transactions with underwriting risks where Deutsche Bank underwrites  commitments with the intention to sell down or distribute part of the risk to third parties. These commitments include the undertaking to provide bank loans for syndication into the debt capital market and bridge loans for the issuance of notes. The inherent risks of being unsuccessful in the distribution of the facilities or the placement of the notes, comprise of a delayed distribution, funding of the underlying loans as well as a pricing risk as some underwriting commitments are additionally exposed to market risk in the form of widening credit spreads. Where applicable, Deutsche Bank dynamically hedges this credit spread risk to be within the approved market risk limit framework.\n\nA major asset class, in which Deutsche Bank is active in underwriting, is leverage lending, which Deutsche Bank mainly executes through its Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit. The business model is a fee-based, originate to distribute approach  focused  on  the  distribution  of  largely  unfunded  underwriting  commitments  into  the  capital  market.  The  aforementioned risks regarding distribution and credit spread movement apply to this business unit, however, are managed under a range of specific notional as well as market risk limits. The latter require the business to also hedge its underwriting pipeline against market dislocations. The fee-based model of the bank's Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit includes a restrictive  approach  to  single-name  risk  concentrations  retained  on  Deutsche  Bank's  balance  sheet,  which  results  in  a diversified overall portfolio without any material concentrations. The resulting longer-term on-balance sheet portfolio is also subject to a comprehensive credit limit and hedging framework.\n\nDeutsche Bank assumes underwriting risk with respect to Commercial Real Estate loans. Primarily in the Commercial Real Estate business unit in the Investment Bank loans may be originated with the intent to securitize in the capital markets or syndicate to other lenders. The afore-mentioned inherent underwriting risks such as delayed distribution and pricing risk are managed through notional caps, market risk limits and hedging against the risk of market dislocations.\n\nDeutsche  Bank  also  provides  material  underwriting  activity  through  its  Debt  Capital  Markets  desk  which  is  focused  on supporting Investment Grade and cross-over rated corporate borrowers, usually in connection with M&A transaction financing. These exposures are typically 12-24 month bridge loans, which are expected to be repaid by syndicated loans and/or capital markets issuance by the borrower. Deutsche Bank does not bear market placement or pricing risk on these exposures but faces funding risk and credit risk for the duration of the commitment, which are managed through notional underwriting limits for the Group and an industry concentration framework.",

        "page_content": "## Market Risk Management\n\n## Market Risk framework\n\nThe vast majority of Deutsche Bank's businesses are subject to market risk, defined as the potential for change in the market value of the Group's trading and invested positions. Risk can arise from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant parameters, such as market volatility and market implied default probabilities. The market risk can affect accounting, economic and regulatory views of the exposure.\n\nMarket Risk Management is part of Deutsche Bank's independent Risk function and sits within the Market and Valuations Risk Management group. One of the primary objectives of Market Risk Management is to ensure that the business units' risk exposure is within the approved risk appetite commensurate with its defined strategy. To achieve this objective, Market Risk Management works closely together with risk takers ('the business units') and other control and support groups.\n\nThe Group distinguishes between three substantially different types of market risk:\n\n- -Trading market risk arises primarily through the market-making and client facilitation activities of the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. This involves taking positions in debt, equity, foreign exchange, other securities and commodities as well as in equivalent derivatives\n- -Traded default risk arising from defaults and rating migrations relating to trading instruments\n- -Non-trading market risk arises from market movements, primarily outside the activities of the trading units, in the banking book and from off-balance sheet items; this includes interest rate risk, credit spread risk, investment risk and foreign exchange risk as well as market risk arising from pension schemes, guaranteed funds and equity compensation; nontrading market risk also includes risk from the modeling of client deposits as well as savings and loan products\n\nMarket Risk Management governance is designed and established to promote oversight of all market risks, effective decisionmaking and timely escalation to senior management.\n\nMarket Risk Management defines and implements a framework to systematically identify, assess, monitor and report the Group's market risk. Market risk managers identify market risks through active portfolio analysis and engagement with the business units.\n\n## Market Risk measurement\n\nThe Group aims to accurately measure all types of market risks by a comprehensive set of risk metrics embedding accounting, economic and regulatory considerations.\n\nThe market risks are measured by several internally developed key risk metrics and regulatory defined market risk approaches.\n\n## Trading Market Risk\n\nThe Group's primary mechanism to manage trading market risk is the application of the bank's risk appetite framework of which the limit framework is a key component. The Management Board, supported by Market Risk Management, sets groupwide  value-at-risk,  economic  capital  and  portfolio  stress  testing  limits  for  market  risk  in  the  trading  book.  Market  Risk Management allocates this overall appetite to the Corporate Divisions and their individual business units based on established and agreed business plans. Deutsche Bank also has business aligned heads within Market Risk Management who establish business unit limits, by allocating the limit down to individual portfolios, geographical regions and types of market risks.\n\nValue-at-risk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits are used for managing all types of market risk at an overall portfolio level. As an additional and important complementary tool for managing certain portfolios or risk types, Market Risk Management  performs  risk  analysis  and  business  specific  stress  testing.  Limits  are  also  set  on  sensitivity  and concentration/liquidity, exposure, business-level stress testing and event risk scenarios, taking into consideration business plans and the risk vs return assessment.\n\nBusiness units are responsible for adhering to the limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. The market risk limits set by Market Risk Management are monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, dependent on the risk management tool being used.",

        "page_content": "## Internally developed Market Risk Models\n\n## Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nVaR is a quantitative measure of the potential loss (in value) of Fair Value positions due to market movements that should not be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level.\n\nThe  Group's  value-at-risk  for  the  trading  businesses  is  based  on  historical  simulation  model  (internal  model  approach) predominantly utilizing full revaluation, although some portfolios remain on a sensitivity based approach. The approach is used for both Risk Management and capital requirements.\n\nRisk management VaR is calibrated to a 99% confidence level and a one day holding period. This means we estimate there is a 1 in 100 chance that a mark-to-market loss from our trading positions will be at least as large as the reported VaR. For regulatory capital purposes, the VaR model is calibrated to a 99% confidence interval and a ten day holding period.\n\nThe calculation employs a historical simulation technique that uses one year of historical market data as input and observed correlations between the risk factors during this one year period.\n\nThe VaR model is designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk factors across all asset classes. Key risk factors are swap/government curves, index and issuer-specific credit curves, single equity and index prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices as well as their implied volatilities. To help ensure completeness in the risk coverage, second order risk factors,  e.g.  money  market  basis,  implied  dividends,  option-adjusted  spreads  and  precious  metals  lease  rates  are  also considered in the VaR calculation. The list of risk factors included in the VaR model is reviewed regularly and enhanced as part of ongoing model performance reviews.\n\nThe model incorporates both linear and, especially for derivatives, nonlinear impacts predominantly through a full revaluation approach but it also utilizes a sensitivity-based approach for certain portfolios. The full revaluation approach uses the historical changes to risk factors as input to pricing functions. Whilst this approach is computationally expensive, it does yield a more accurate view of market risk for nonlinear positions, especially under stressed scenarios. The sensitivity based approach uses sensitivities to underlying risk factors in combination with historical changes to those risk factors.\n\nFor each business unit a separate VaR is calculated for each risk type, e.g. interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk. 'Diversification effect' reflects the fact that the total VaR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VaR relating to the individual risk types. Simply adding the VaR figures of the individual risk types to arrive at an aggregate VaR would imply the assumption that the losses in all risk types occur simultaneously.\n\nThe VaR enables the Group to apply a consistent measure across the fair value exposures. It allows a comparison of risk in different businesses, and also provides a means of aggregating and netting positions within a portfolio to reflect correlations and offsets between different asset classes. Furthermore, it facilitates comparisons of the market risk both over time and against the daily trading results.\n\nWhen using VaR results a number of considerations should be taken into account. These include:\n\n- -The use of historical market data may not be a good indicator of potential future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this 'backward-looking' limitation can cause VaR to understate future potential losses (as in financial credit crisis 2008/09), but can also cause it to be overstated immediately following a period of significant stress (as in COVID-19 pandemic)\n- -The one day holding period does not fully capture the market risk arising during periods of illiquidity, when positions cannot be closed out or hedged within one day\n- -VaR does not indicate the potential loss beyond the 99 th quantile\n- -Intra-day risk is not reflected in the end of day VaR calculation\n- -There may be risks in the trading or banking book that are not fully captured in the VaR model (either partially captured or missing entirely)\n\nThe process of systematically capturing and evaluating risks currently not captured in the bank's VaR model has been further developed and improved. An assessment is made to determine the level of materiality of these risks and material risks are prioritized for inclusion in the bank's internal model. Risks not in VaR are monitored and assessed on a regular basis through the Risk Not In VaR (RNIV) framework. This framework has also undergone a significant overhaul in 2020 which included the alignment of methodologies with the Historical Simulation approach which in turn yields a more accurate estimate of the contribution of these missing items and their potential capitalization.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to the ongoing development of the internal risk models, and substantial resources are allocated to review, validate and improve them.",

The Group calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure using a 99% confidence level. Stressed VaR is calculated with a holding period of ten days. The SVaR calculation utilizes the same systems, trade information and processes as those used for the calculation of value-at-risk. The only difference is that historical market data and observed correlations from a period of significant financial stress (i.e., characterized by high volatilities) are used as an input for the historical simulation.\n\nThe stress period selection process for the stressed value-at-risk calculation is based on the comparison of VaR calculated using historical time windows compared to the current SVaR. If a historical window produces a VaR which is higher than the current SVaR, it is further investigated and the SVaR window can subsequently be updated accordingly. This process runs on a quarterly basis.\n\nDuring 2023, the stress period selection process for the Group was conducted as outlined above. As a result, the SVaR window used at various periods in 2023 included the Financial credit crisis of 2008/09 and the European sovereign crisis of 2011/12.\n\n## Incremental Risk Charge\n\nIncremental Risk Charge captures default and credit rating migration risks for credit-sensitive positions in the trading book. The Group uses a Monte Carlo Simulation for calculating incremental risk charge as the 99.9% quantile of the portfolio loss distribution over a one-year capital horizon under a constant position approach and for allocating contributory incremental risk charge to individual positions.\n\nThe model captures the default and migration risk in an accurate and consistent quantitative approach for all portfolios. Important  parameters  for  the  incremental  risk  charge  calculation  are  exposures,  recovery  rates,  maturities,  ratings  with corresponding default and migration probabilities and parameters specifying issuer correlations.\n\n## Market Risk Standardized Approach\n\nThe Market Risk Standardized Approach ('MRSA') is used to determine the regulatory capital charge for the specific market risk  of  trading  book  securitizations,  for  certain  types  of  investment  funds  and  for  longevity  risk  as  set  out  in  CRR/CRD regulations.\n\nLongevity risk is the risk of adverse changes in life expectancies resulting in a loss in value on longevity linked policies and transactions. For risk management purposes, stress testing and economic capital allocations are also used to monitor and manage longevity risk.\n\n## Market Risk Stress Testing\n\nStress  testing  is  a  key  risk  management  technique,  which  evaluates  the  potential  effects  of  extreme  market  events  and movements in individual risk factors. It is one of the core quantitative tools used to assess the market risk of Deutsche Bank's positions and complements VaR and Economic Capital. Market Risk Management performs several types of stress testing to capture  the  variety  of  risks  (Portfolio  Stress  Testing,  individual  specific  stress  tests  and  Event  Risk  Scenarios)  and  also contributes to Group-wide stress testing. These stress tests cover a wide range of severities designed to test the earnings stability and capital adequacy of the bank.\n\n## Trading Market Risk Economic Capital\n\nDeutsche Bank's trading market risk economic capital model-scaled Stressed VaR based EC (SVaR based EC) - comprises two core components, the 'common risk' component covering risk drivers across all businesses and the 'business-specific risk'  component,  which  enriches  the  Common  Risk  via  a  suite  of  Business  Specific  Stress  Tests.  Both  components  are calibrated to historically observed severe market shocks. Common risk is calculated using a scaled version of the SVaR framework while Business Specific Stress Tests are designed to capture more product/business-related bespoke risks (e.g. complex basis risks) as well as higher order risks not captured in the common risk component. The SVaR based EC uses the Monte Carlo SVaR framework.",

        "page_content": "## Traded Default Risk Economic Capital\n\nThe Traded Default Risk Economic Capital captures the relevant credit exposures across our trading and fair value banking books. Trading book exposures are monitored by Market Risk Management via single name concentration and portfolio thresholds which are set based upon rating, size and liquidity. Single name concentration risk thresholds are set for two key metrics: Default Exposure, i.e., the P&L impact of an instantaneous default at the current recovery rate, and bond equivalent Market Value, i.e. default exposure at 0% recovery. In order to capture diversification and concentration effects we perform a joint  calculation  for  traded  default  risk  economic  capital  and  credit  risk  economic  capital.  Important  parameters  for  the calculation of traded default risk are exposures, recovery rates and default probabilities as well as maturities. The probability of joint rating downgrades and defaults is determined by the default and rating correlations of the portfolio model. These correlations are specified through systematic factors that represent countries, geographical regions and industries.\n\n## Trading Market Risk Reporting\n\nMarket Risk Management reporting creates transparency on the risk profile and facilitates the understanding of core market risk drivers to all levels of the organization. The Management Board and Senior Governance Committees receive regular reporting, as well as ad hoc reporting as required, on market risk, regulatory capital and stress testing. Senior Risk Committees receive risk information at a number of frequencies, including weekly or monthly.\n\nAdditionally, Market Risk Management produces daily and weekly Market Risk specific reports and daily limit utilization reports for each business owner.\n\n## Regulatory prudent valuation of assets carried at fair value\n\nPursuant to  Article  34  CRR,  institutions  shall  apply  the  prudent  valuation  requirements  of  Article  105  CRR  to  all  assets measured at fair value and shall deduct from CET 1 capital the amount of any additional value adjustments necessary.\n\nWe determined  the  amount  of  the  additional  value  adjustments  based  on  the  methodology  defined  in  the  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the amount of the additional value adjustments was \u20ac 1.7 billion. The December 31, 2022 amount was \u20ac 2.0 billion. The decrease was predominantly due to a combination of risk exposure changes and reductions in price dispersion.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023  the  reduction  of  the  expected  loss  from  subtracting  the  additional  value  adjustments  was \u20ac 102 million, which partly mitigated the negative impact of the additional value adjustments on our CET 1 capital.\n\n## Non-trading Market Risk\n\nNon-trading market risk arises primarily from activities outside of the trading units, in the banking book, including pension schemes and guarantees, and embedding considerations of different accounting treatments of transactions. Significant market risk factors the Group is exposed to and are overseen by risk management groups in that area are interest rate risk (including risk  from  embedded  optionality  and  changes  in  behavioral  patterns  for  certain  product  types),  credit  spread  risk,  foreign exchange  risk  (including  structural  foreign  exchange  risk),  equity  risk  (including  equity  compensation  related  risk  and investments in public and private equity as well as real estate, infrastructure and fund assets).\n\nAs for trading market risks the Group's risk appetite and limit framework is also applied to manage our exposure to non-trading market risk. On group level those are captured by the management board set limits for market risk economic capital capturing exposures to all market risks across asset classes as well as earnings and economic value based limits for interest rate risk in the banking books. Those limits are cascaded down by market risk management to the divisional or portfolio level. The limit framework for non-trading market risk exposure is further complemented by a set of business specific stress tests, value-atrisk & sensitivity limits monitored on a daily or monthly basis dependent on the risk measure being used.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk, to both the Group's capital and earnings, arising from movements in interest rates, which affect the Group's banking book exposures. This includes gap risk, which arises from the term structure of banking book instruments, basis risk, which describes the impact of relative changes in interest rates for financial instruments that are priced using different interest rate curves, as well as option risk, which arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "The Group manages its IRRBB exposures using economic value as well as earnings based measures. The Group Treasury function is mandated to manage the interest rate risk centrally, with Market Risk Management acting as 2nd Line of Defense (LoD) independently assessing and challenging the implementation of the framework and adherence to the risk appetite. Group Audit in its role as the 3rd LoD is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal control. The Group Asset & Liability Committee ('ALCo') oversees and steers the Group's structural interest risk position with particular focus on banking book risks and the management of the net interest income. The ALCo monitors the sensitivity of financial resources and associated metrics to key market parameters such as interest rate curves and oversees adherence to divisional/business financial resource limits.\n\nEconomic value based measures look at the change in economic value of banking book assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet  exposures  resulting  from  interest  rate  movements,  independent  of  the  accounting  treatment.  Thereby  the  Group measures the change in economic value of equity (\u2206EVE) as the maximum decrease of the banking book economic value under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes. For the reporting of internal stress scenarios and risk appetite the Group applies a few different modelling assumptions as used in this disclosure. When aggregating the economic value of equity \u2206EVE across different currencies, DB adds up negative and positive changes without applying weight factors for positive changes. Furthermore, the Group is using behavioral model assumptions about the interest rate duration of own equity capital as well as non-maturity deposits from financial institutions.\n\nEarnings-based measures look at the expected change in net interest income (NII) resulting from interest rate movements over a defined time horizon, compared to a defined benchmark scenario. Thereby the Group measures net interest income \u2206NII as the maximum reduction under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes, compared to a market implied curve scenario, over a period of 12 months.\n\nThe Group employs mitigation techniques to hedge the interest rate risk arising from non-trading positions within given limits. The interest rate risk arising from non-trading asset and liability positions is managed through Treasury Markets & Investments. Thereby the Group uses derivatives and applies different hedge accounting techniques such as fair value hedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. For hedges in the context of the cash flow hedge accounting, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of the variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe 'Model Risk Management' function performs independent validation of models used for IRRBB measurement, as per all market risk models, in line with Deutsche Bank's group-wide risk governance framework.\n\nThe calculation of VaR and sensitivities of interest rate risk is performed daily, whereas the measurement and reporting of economic value interest rate and earnings risk is performed on a monthly basis. The Group generally uses the same metrics in its internal management systems as it applies for the disclosure in this report.\n\nDeutsche Bank's key modelling assumptions are applied to the positions in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. Those positions are subject to risk of changes in client's behavior with regard to their deposits as well as loan products. The Group regularly  tests  the  assumptions  and  updates  them  where  appropriate  following  a  defined  governance  process.  In particular, the Group has made changes to its assumptions during the early phase of rising interest rates where a slower repricing in deposits was observed than it was anticipated.\n\nThe Group manages the interest rate risk exposure of its non-maturity deposits through a replicating portfolio approach to determine the average repricing maturity of the portfolio. For the purpose of constructing the replicating portfolio, the portfolio of non-maturity deposits is clustered by dimensions such as business unit, currency, product and geographical location. The main dimensions influencing the repricing maturity are elasticity of deposit rates to market interest rates, volatility of deposit balances and observable client behavior. For the reporting period the average repricing maturity assigned across all such replicating portfolios is 2.40 years and Deutsche Bank uses 15 years as the longest repricing maturity.\n\nIn the loan and some of the term deposit products Deutsche Bank considers early prepayment/withdrawal behavior of its customers. The parameters are based on historical observations, statistical analyses and expert assessments.\n\nFurthermore, the Group generally calculates IRRBB related metrics in contractual currencies and aggregates the resulting metrics  for  reporting  purposes.  When  calculating  economic  value  based  metrics  the  commercial  margin  is  excluded  for material parts of the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book\n\nDeutsche Bank is exposed to credit spread risk of bonds held in the banking book, mainly as part of the Treasury Liquidity Reserves portfolio. The credit spread risk in the banking book is managed by the businesses, with Market Risk Management acting as an independent oversight function ensuring that the exposure is within the approved risk appetite. This risk category is  closely  associated  with  interest  rate  risk  in  the  banking  book  as  changes  in  the  perceived  credit  quality  of  individual instruments  may  result  in  fluctuations  in  spreads  relative  to  underlying  interest  rates.  The  calculation  of  credit  spread sensitivities  and  value-at-risk  for  credit  spread  exposure is  in  general  performed  on  a  daily  basis,  the  measurement  and reporting of economic capital and stress tests are performed on a monthly basis.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from non-trading asset and liability positions that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. The majority of this foreign exchange risk is transferred through internal hedges to trading books within the Investment Bank and is therefore reflected and managed via the value-at-risk figures in the trading books.  The  remaining  foreign  exchange  risks  that  have  not  been  transferred  are  mitigated  through  match  funding  the investment in the same currency, so that only residual risk remains in the portfolios. Small exceptions to above approach follow the general Market Risk Management monitoring and reporting process, as outlined for the trading portfolio.\n\nThe bulk of non-trading open foreign exchange risk arises from the foreign exchange translation of local capital into the reporting currency of the Group and related capital hedge positions. Thereby structural open long positions are taken for a selected number of relevant currencies to immunize the sensitivity of the capital ratio of the Group against changes in the exchange rates.\n\n## Equity and investment risk\n\nNon-trading equity risk is arising predominantly from our non-consolidated investment holdings in the banking book and from our equity compensation plans.\n\nDeutsche  Bank's  non-consolidated  equity  investment  holdings  in  the  banking  book  are  categorized  into  strategic  and alternative  investment  assets.  Strategic  investments  typically  relate  to  acquisitions  made  to  support  the  bank's  business franchise and are undertaken with a medium to long-term investment horizon. Alternative assets are comprised of principal investments and other non-strategic investment assets. Principal investments are direct investments in private equity, real estate, venture capital, hedge or mutual funds whereas assets recovered in the workout of distressed positions or other legacy investment assets in private equity and real estate are of a non-strategic nature.\n\nInvestment proposals for strategic investments as well as monitoring of progress and performance against committed targets are evaluated by the Group Investment Committee. Depending on size, strategic investments may require approval from the Group Investment Committee, the Management Board or the Supervisory Board.\n\nCredit Risk Management Principal Investments is responsible for the risk-related governance and monitoring of our alternative asset activities. The review of new or increased principal investment commitments is the task of the Principal Investment Commitment Approval Group, established by the Enterprise Risk Committee as a risk management forum for alternative asset investments. The Principal Investment Commitment Approval Group approves investments under its authority or recommends decisions above its authority to the Management Board for approval. The Management Board also sets investment limits for business divisions and various portfolios of risk upon recommendation by the Enterprise Risk Committee.\n\nThe equity investment holdings are included in regular group wide stress tests and the monthly market risk economic capital calculations.",

Market risks in pension plans materialize due to a potential decline in the market value of plan assets or an increase in the present value of the  pension  liability  of  each  of  the  pension  plans.  Market  Risk  Management  is  responsible  for  a  regular  measurement, monitoring, reporting and control of market risks of the asset and liability side of the defined benefit pension plans.

        "page_content": "## Operational risk management\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nDeutsche Bank applies the European Banking Authority's Single Rulebook definition of operational risk:  'Operational risk means the risk of losses stemming from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risks but excludes business and reputational risk and is embedded in all banking products and activities.' Operational risk forms a subset of the bank's non-financial risks.\n\nDeutsche Bank's operational risk appetite sets out the amount of operational risk it is willing to accept as a consequence of doing business. The bank takes on operational risks consciously, both strategically as well as in day-to-day business. While the bank may have no appetite for certain types of operational risk events (such as violations of laws or regulations and misconduct), in other cases a certain amount of operational risk must be accepted if the bank is to achieve its business objectives. In case a residual risk is assessed to be outside risk appetite, risk reducing actions must be undertaken, including remediating the risks, insuring risks or ceasing business.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess, mitigate  and  monitor  the  bank's  operational  risks.  Its  components  have  been  designed  to  operate  together  to  provide  a comprehensive, risk-based approach to managing the bank's most material operational risks. Operational Risk Management Framework components include the Group's approach to setting and adhering to operational risk appetite, the operational risk type and control taxonomies, the policies and procedures for operational risk management processes including the respective tools, and the bank's operational risk capital model.\n\n## Organizational and governance structure\n\nWhile the day-to-day management of operational risk is the primary responsibility of business divisions and infrastructure functions, where these risks are generated, Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) oversees the Group-wide management of operational risks, identifies and reports risk concentrations, and promotes a consistent application of the Operational Risk Management Framework across the bank. NFRM is part of the Group's risk function, the Chief Risk Office, which is headed by the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer appoints the Head of NFRM, who is accountable for the design, oversight and maintenance of an effective, efficient and regulatory compliant Operational Risk Management Framework, including the operational risk capital model.  The  Head  of  NFRM  monitors  and  challenges  the  Operational  Risk  Management  Framework's  Group  wide implementation and monitors overall risk levels against the bank's operational risk appetite.\n\nThe Non-Financial Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of operational risk in the Group on behalf of the Management Board, by establishing a cross-risk and holistic perspective of the key operational risks of the Group. Its decision-making and policy related authorities include the review, advice and management of all operational risk issues that may impact the risk profile of business divisions and infrastructure functions. Several sub-fora with attendees from both the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD support the Non-Financial Risk Committee to effectively fulfil its mandate. In addition to the Group level Non-Financial Risk Committee, business divisions have established 1st LoD non-financial risk fora for the oversight and management of operational risks on various levels of the organization.\n\nThe governance of operational risks follows the bank's 3LoD approach to managing all of its financial and non-financial risks. The Operational Risk Management Framework establishes the operational risk governance standards including the core 1st and 2nd LoD roles and their responsibilities, to ensure effective risk management and appropriate independent challenge.\n\nOperational risk requirements for the 1st LoD: Risk owners as the 1st LoD have full accountability for their operational risks and manage these against a defined risk appetite.\n\nRisk owners are those roles in the bank whose activities generate - or who are exposed to - operational risks. As heads of business divisions and infrastructure functions, they must determine the appropriate organizational structure to identify their operational risk profile, actively manage these risks within their organization, take business decisions on the mitigation or acceptance of operational risks to ensure they remain within risk appetite, and establish and maintain 1st LoD controls.\n\nOperational risk requirements for the 2nd LoD: Risk Type Controllers act as the 2nd LoD control functions for all sub-risk types under the overarching risk type 'Operational Risk'.",

        "page_content": "Risk Type Controllers establish the framework and define Group level risk appetite statements for the specific operational risk type they oversee. Risk Type Controllers define the minimum risk management and control standards and independently monitor and challenge risk owners' implementation of these standards in their day-to-day processes, as well as their risktaking and risk management activities. Risk Type Controllers provide independent operational risk oversight and prepare aggregated risk type profile reporting. Risk Type Controllers monitor the risk type's profile against risk appetite and have a right to veto risk decisions leading to foreseeable risk appetite breaches. As risk type experts, Risk Type Controllers define the risk type and its taxonomy and support and facilitate the implementation of the risk type framework in the 1st LoD. To maintain their independence, Risk Type Controller roles are located only in infrastructure functions.\n\nOperational risk requirements for NFRM as the Risk Type Controller for the overarching risk type 'Operational Risk': As the Risk Type Controller / risk control function for operational risk, NFRM establishes and maintains the overarching Operational Risk Management Framework and determines the appropriate level of capital to underpin the Group's operational risk.\n\n- -As the 2nd LoD risk control function, NFRM defines the bank's approach to operational risk appetite and monitors its adherence, breaches and consequences; NFRM is the independent reviewer and challenger of the 1st LoD's risk and control assessments and risk management activities relating to the holistic operational risk profile of a unit (while Risk Type Controllers monitor and challenge activities related to their specific risk types). NFRM provides the oversight of risk and control mitigation plans to return the bank's operational risk to its risk appetite, where required; it also establishes and regularly reports the bank's operational risk profile and operational top risks, i.e. the bank's material operational risks which are outside of risk appetite\n- -As  the  subject  matter  expert  for  operational  risk,  NFRM  provides  independent  risk  views  to  facilitate  forward-looking management of operational risks, actively engages with risk owners (1st LoD) and facilitates the implementation of risk management and control standards across the bank\n- -NFRM is accountable for the design, implementation and maintenance of the approach to determine the adequate level of capital required for operational risk, for recommendation to the Management Board; This includes the calculation and allocation of operational risk capital demand and expected loss under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)\n\n## Managing operational risk\n\nTo manage the broad range of sub-risk types underlying operational risk, the Operational Risk Management Framework provides a set of tools and processes that apply to all operational risk types across the bank. These enable the bank to determine its operational risk profile in relation to risk appetite for operational risk, to systematically identify operational risk themes and concentrations, and to define risk mitigating measures and priorities.\n\nIn  2023, the bank continued to mature the management of operational risk by further integrating and simplifying the risk management process.  This  was  achieved  through  enhancement  of  the  bank's  central  controls  inventory;  upgrading  the application used to analyze operational risk loss events by integrating 'lessons learned' functionality; introduction of residual risk tolerance zones in the risk appetite framework and by extending framework adherence monitoring to also cover 2LoD activities\n\nLoss  data  collection:  Data  on  internal  and  relevant  external  operational  risk  events  (with  a  P&L  impact  \u2265  \u20ac 10,000)  is independently validated in a timely manner. Material operational risk events trigger clearly defined lessons learned and readacross analyses, which are performed in the 1st LoD in close collaboration between business partners, risk control and other infrastructure functions. Lessons learned reviews analyze the reasons for significant operational risk events, identify their root causes, and document appropriate remediation actions to reduce the likelihood of their reoccurrence. Read across reviews take  the  conclusions  of  the  lessons  learned  process  and  seek  to  analyze  whether  similar  risks  and  control  weaknesses identified in a lessons learned review exist in other areas of the bank, even if they have not yet resulted in problems or losses. This allows preventative actions to be undertaken. In 2023, lesson learned documentation functionality was integrated into the operational risk event management application (EMApp), allowing for direct technical linkage to the underlying operational risk event and enhanced lessons learned monitoring, governance and reporting.\n\nScenario  analysis:  The  operational  risk  profile  is  complemented  and  further  substantiated  by  incorporating  exploratory scenario  analysis  into  day-to-day  risk  management  activities.  Scenario  analysis  is  used  as  a  risk  identification  and management tool that enables risk owners and Risk Type Controllers to explore potential exposure to risk as the basis for identifying potential gaps in the banks existing operational risk profile. Furthermore, it is used as an input into the calculation of the operational risk capital for the bank. Scenario storylines build on internal losses, emerging risk reviews, top risks and risk concentrations, and findings, as well as the review of external peer operational risk loss events. Information from actual and potential future loss events are systematically utilized to identify thematic susceptibilities and actively seek to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents, for example through deep dive analyses or risk profile reviews. In 2023, the scenario analysis process has been strengthened by further tightening the roles and responsibilities within the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD in executing scenarios  and  scenario  analysis  continues  to  play  an  important  role  in  operational  resilience  exercises,  particularly  in assessing impacts of emerging risk themes. Additionally, work has started which will allow scenario analysis to be performed in the event management application (EMApp) in order to automate the capture, governance and reporting..",

        "page_content": "Risk & Control Assessment: The risk and control assessment process comprises of a series of bottom-up assessments of the risks generated by business divisions and infrastructure functions, the effectiveness of the controls in place to manage them, and the remediation actions required to bring the risks within the risk appetite perimeter. The Risk & Control Assessment is performed at a global business level and as such covers all jurisdictions. It is designed to assist Senior Management to determine whether operational risks are being managed and controlled adequately via a dynamic assessment approach which covers  all  applicable  Risk  Types  from  the  Group's  Non-Financial  Risk  Type  Taxonomy  (NFRTT).  The  Risk  &  Control Assessment puts a greater emphasis on assessing and mitigating risks that are outside of  appetite and risks that drive unethical and inappropriate market conduct within the bank.\n\nTop risks: The Top Risk process is a regular process to identify the risks which pose greatest concern across Group and divisions, in addition to ensuring there is commensurate remediation activity associated to mitigate the risk. The associated Top Risk reporting provides a forward-looking perspective on the impact of top risk reduction programs, comprising of planned remediation and control enhancements, indicating the expected timeframe for reduction. The reporting also contains emerging risks and themes that have the potential to influence the top risk population in the future. The top risk identification process is closely connected to both the risk and control assessment and risk appetite, consuming the risk exposure from the former and the appetite levels from the latter to help inform the top risk population.\n\nTransformation Risk Assessment: To identify and appropriately manage risks from material change initiatives within the bank, a transformation risk assessment process is in place to assess the impact of transformation on the bank's risk profile and control environment. The assessment considers impacts to financial and non-financial risk types and is mandatory for a subset of  initiatives,  categorized  as  key  deliverables  (typically  includes  regulatory  initiatives,  technology  migrations,  remediation initiatives, strategy and organizational changes). In 2023 the scope of the transformation risk assessment was expanded to cover to bank's future joint ventures and strategic investments, to implement requirements of the bank's updated Joint Venture and Strategic Investment Policy.\n\nRisk appetite: Non-financial risk appetite reflects the amount of non-financial risk the bank is willing to accept to pursue its strategy. The non-financial risk appetite framework provides a common approach to define the level of risk appetite across the firm and monitor exposure against this appetite. NFR appetite metrics are used to monitor the operational risk profile against the bank's defined risk appetite, and to alert the organization to impending problems in a timely fashion. In 2023, design amendments have been made resulting in the introduction of residual risk tolerance zones which allow for a more precise articulation of tolerance for residual risk assessed by the risk and control assessment process. This introduces defined consequences for given combinations of likelihood and severity of impact for a given risk type.\n\nFindings and issue management: The findings and issue management process facilitates the bank in mitigating the risks associated with known control weaknesses and deficiencies, and enables management to make risk-based decisions over the  need  for  further  remediation  or  risk  acceptance.  Outputs  from  the  findings  management  process  must  be  able  to demonstrate to internal and external stakeholders that the bank is actively identifying its control weaknesses and taking steps to manage associated risks within acceptable levels of risk appetite. In 2023, Group Audit's review and approval role in the lifecycle of Self-Identified Issues was enhanced. Additionally, the scope of the 'Findings to Control' linkage was expanded to cover all Risk Types and integrated in the Findings management tool.\n\nFramework Adherence: Operational Risk Framework Adherence is a key activity to oversee, monitor and test the conformity to NFR Framework component requirements by key stakeholders.

The Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess,  measure,  monitor  and  mitigate  Deutsche  Bank  Group's  operational  risks  according  to  regulatory  and  industryestablished definition of operational risk. It applies to the operational sub-risk types on a more granular level and enables the bank  to  aggregate  and  monitor  its  operational  risk  profile.  These  operational  sub-risk  types  are  controlled  by  various infrastructure functions and include the following:\n\n- -The Compliance department performs an independent 2nd level control function that protects the bank's license to operate by promoting and enforcing compliance with the law and driving a culture of compliance and ethical conduct in the bank; the Compliance department assists and challenges the business divisions and works with other infrastructure functions and regulators to establish and maintain a risk-based approach to the management of the bank's compliance risks in accordance with the bank's risk appetite and to help the bank detect, mitigate and prevent breaches of laws and regulations; the Compliance department performs the following principal activities: the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting  on  compliance  risk;  performs  second  level  controls;  the  results  of  these  assessments  and  controls  are regularly  reported  to  the  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board;  the  Compliance  department  also  assists  the Regulatory Management team with regulatory engagement\n- -Financial crime risks are managed by the Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) function via maintenance and development of a dedicated program; the AFC program is based on regulatory and supervisory requirements; AFC has defined roles and responsibilities and established dedicated functions for the identification and management of financial crime risks resulting from money laundering, terrorism financing, compliance with sanctions and embargoes, the facilitation of tax evasion as well  as  other  criminal  activities  including  fraud,  bribery  and  corruption  and  other  crimes;  AFC  updates  its  strategy  for financial  crime  prevention  via  regular  development  of  internal  policies  processes  and  controls,  institution-specific  risk assessment and staff training\n- -The Legal department is a fully independent infrastructure function, mandated to provide legal advice to the Management Board, the Supervisory Board (restricted to matters that do not give rise to conflict of interest), corporate divisions and infrastructure functions, and to support the Management Board in setting up and guarding the bank's corporate governance framework and manage the bank's legal corporate governance framework, antitrust legal and data privacy risk\n\nThe Legal Department carries out its mandate through the following responsibilities:\n\n- -Advising the Management Board and Supervisory Board on legal aspects of their activities\n- -Providing legal advice to all Deutsche Bank units to facilitate adherence to legal and regulatory requirements in relation to their activities respectively\n- -Supporting other bank units managing Deutsche Bank Group's interactions with regulatory authorities\n- -Engaging and managing external lawyers used by Deutsche Bank Group (in conjunction with the Outside Counsel Management team in Regulatory & Exam Management\n- -Managing Deutsche Bank Group's litigation and contentious regulatory matters, (including contentious HR matters), and managing Deutsche Bank Group's response to external regulatory enforcement investigations\n- -Establishing appropriate processes for the preparation, review and execution of transactional documentation\n- -Preserving documents in connection with the management of Continuous Matters by issuing Legal Holds\n- -Advising on legal aspects of internal investigations\n- -Setting the global governance framework for Deutsche Bank Group, facilitating its cross-unit application and assessing its implementation\n- -Developing and safeguarding efficient corporate governance structures suitable to support efficient decision-making, to align risk and accountability based on clear and consistent roles and responsibilities\n- -Maintaining Deutsche Bank Group's framework for policies, procedures, framework and key operating documents and serving in particular as guardian for the same\n- -Setting the framework for the establishment, composition and functioning of joint decision-making bodies, ensuring its consistent implementation and providing a framework and platforms for sustainable, and auditable documentation of decision-making events, allowing for central swift retrieval of information\n- -Setting the framework for and facilitating the legal entity approval processes\n- -Advising on internal corporate governance topics to ensure the implementation of the governance frameworks, including the analysis of corporate governance specific laws and regulations, interaction with supervisors on internal corporate governance-related topics and the ongoing development of solutions for organizational/structural topics of Deutsche Bank Group",

The AMA capital calculation is based upon the loss distribution approach. Gross losses from historical internal and external loss data (Operational Riskdata eXchange Association consortium data)  complemented  by  scenario  data  are  used  to  estimate  the  risk  profile  (i.e.,  a  loss  frequency  and  a  loss  severity distribution). The loss distribution approach model includes conservatism by recognizing losses on events that arise over multiple years as single events in the historical loss profile.\n\nWithin the loss distribution approach model, the frequency and severity distributions are combined in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate potential losses over a one-year time horizon. Finally, the risk mitigating benefits of insurance are applied to each loss generated in the Monte Carlo simulation. Correlation and diversification benefits are applied to the net losses in a manner compatible with regulatory requirements to arrive at a net loss distribution at Group level, covering expected and unexpected losses. Capital is then allocated to each of the business divisions considering qualitative adjustments after deducting expected loss.\n\nThe regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk is derived from the 99.9% percentile; see the section 'Internal Capital Adequacy' for details. Both regulatory and economic capital requirements are calculated for a time horizon of one year.\n\nThe  regulatory  and  economic  capital  demand  calculations  are  performed  on  a  quarterly  basis.  NFRM  establishes  and maintains the approach for capital demand quantification and ensures that appropriate development, validation and change governance processes are in place, whereby the validation is performed by an independent validation function and in line with the Group's model risk management process.",

        "page_content": "## Drivers for operational risk capital development\n\nBy design of the AMA capital calculation, Deutsche Bank's operational risk capital demand is predominantly driven by historical internal  loss  events.  In  view  of  the  relevance  of  legal  risks  within  the  bank's  operational  risk  profile,  specific  attention  is dedicated to the management and measurement of open civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the bank relies both on information from internal as well as external data sources to consider developments in legal matters that affect the  bank  specifically  but  also  the  banking  industry  as  a  whole.  Reflecting  the  multi-year  nature  of  legal  proceedings  the measurement of these risks furthermore takes into account changing levels of certainty by capturing the risks at various stages throughout the lifecycle of a legal matter.\n\nConceptually, the bank measures operational risk including legal risk by determining the annual operational risk loss that will not be exceeded with a given probability. This loss amount is driven by a component that due to the IFRS criteria is reflected in the bank's financial statements and a component beyond the amount reflected as provisions within the bank's financial statements.\n\nThe legal losses which the bank expects with a likelihood of more than 50% are already reflected in the IFRS group financial statements. These losses include net changes in provisions for existing and new cases in a specific period where the loss is deemed probable and is reliably measurable in accordance with IAS 37.\n\nUncertain legal losses which are not reflected in the bank's financial statements as provisions because they do not meet the recognition criteria under IAS 37 are considered within regulatory or economic capital demand.\n\nTo quantify the litigation losses in the AMA model, the bank takes into account historical losses, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal forecasts. Legal forecasts generally comprise ranges of potential losses covering risks of outflows greater than the provision and topside adjustments which are deemed remote or relate to yet unknown matters. Such forecasts may result from ongoing and new legal matters which are reviewed at least quarterly by the attorneys handling the legal matters.\n\nThe legal forecasts are included in the 'relevant loss data' used in the AMA model. The projection range of the legal forecasts is not restricted to the one year capital time horizon but goes beyond and conservatively assumes early settlement of the underlying losses in the reporting period - thus considering the multi-year nature of legal matters.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk arises from Deutsche Bank Group's potential inability to meet payment obligations when they come due or without incurring excessive costs. The Group's risk taxonomy differentiates between two aspects of liquidity risk: Short-term liquidity risk and Structural funding risk, both embedded in one liquidity risk management framework. Its objective is to ensure that all necessary governance and controls are established within the Group to fulfil its payment obligations at all times (including intraday) and to manage its liquidity and funding risks within the Management Board approved risk appetite, when executing the strategic plan. The framework considers relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk, whether on-balance sheet or offbalance sheet.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk framework\n\nThe Management Board defines the liquidity and funding risk strategy for the Group and sets the risk appetite, based on recommendations made by the Group Asset and Liability Committee and Group Risk Committee. The Management Board reviews and approves the risk appetite at least annually. The risk appetite is applied to the Group and to bespoke Key Liquidity Entities e.g., Deutsche Bank AG to monitor and control liquidity risk as well as the Group's long-term funding and issuance plan.\n\nThe Liquidity Risk Management Framework defines the organization of the liquidity managing functions in alignment with the three lines of defense structure, which is described in the 'Risk Management Policy'. The Corporate Divisions and Treasury comprise the first line of defense, responsible for executing the steps needed to most effectively manage the liquidity of the Group and steer business activities. Risk comprises the second line of defense, responsible for defining the liquidity risk management framework, providing independent risk oversight, challenge, and validation of activities conducted by the first line  of  defense,  including  establishing  the  risk  appetite.  Group  Audit  comprises  the  third  line  of  defense,  responsible  for overseeing the activities of both the first line of defense and second line of defense.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee is the Group's decisive governing body mandated by the Management Board to optimize the sourcing and deployment of the Group's balance sheet and financial resources in line with the Management Board's risk appetite and strategy. The Group Asset and Liability Committee has the overarching responsibility to define, approve and optimize the Group's funding strategy. Regarding the second line of defense the Group Risk Committee is mandated by the Management Board with decision-making authority regarding material risk-related topics. In addition, it reviews and recommends items for Management Board approval, including key risk management principles, the Group's risk appetite statement, recovery plan, the contingency funding plan, over-arching risk appetite parameters, and recovery and escalation indicators.\n\nThe  Group's  liquidity  risk  management  principles  are  documented  in  the  'Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy'  and  the framework is described in the 'Global Liquidity Risk Framework' and 'Global Funding Risk Framework' documents. Both the policy and framework documents adhere to and articulate how the eight key risk management practices are applied to liquidity risk, namely risk governance, risk organization (3 lines of defense), risk culture, risk appetite and -strategy, risk identification and -assessment, risk mitigation and controls, risk measurement and reporting, stress planning and -execution. The individual roles and responsibilities are laid out and documented in the Global Responsibility Matrix, which provides further clarity and transparency on the roles and responsibilities across all involved stakeholders. All additional policies and procedures (both global and local) issued by the liquidity risk management functions further define the requirements specific to liquidity risk practices. They are subordinate to the 'Liquidity Risk Management Policy' and are subject to the standards it sets forth.\n\nIn accordance with the European Central Bank's Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (and revised Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process requirement issued in November 2018), the Group has implemented an Internal Liquidity Adequacy  Assessment  Process,  which  is  assessed,  documented  and  reviewed  at  least  annually  and  approved  by  the Management Board.\n\nAs part of an annual strategic planning process, Treasury projects the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics including the U.S. Dollar currency exposure based on anticipated business activities to ensure that the strategic plan can be executed in accordance with the Group's risk appetite.",

This Risk Appetite Statement is further underpinned by the liquidity risk controls framework consisting of 'Key Limits' based on risk appetite, as well as a suite of additional limits, thresholds and early warning indicators.\n\nDeutsche Bank implemented a dedicated Risk Appetite framework covering regulatory Pillar 1as well as internal stress metrics (Pillar 2) which are defined by Liquidity Risk Management and ensure the Group's liquidity position is balanced across the Group, its Key Liquidity Entities and across currencies.\n\nTreasury  manages  liquidity  and  funding,  in  accordance  with  the  risk  appetite  across  a  range  of  relevant  metrics  and implements several tools including business level risk appetite limits further cascading aspects of risk appetite to divisional level, to ensure compliance. As such, Treasury works closely with Liquidity Risk Management under its delegated authority and the business divisions to identify, analyze and monitor underlying liquidity risk characteristics within business portfolios. These parties are engaged in regular dialogue regarding changes in the Group's liquidity position arising  from  business activities and market circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, the Group ensures at the level of each liquidity relevant entity that all local liquidity metrics are managed in compliance with the defined risk appetite. Local liquidity surpluses are pooled in Deutsche Bank AG hubs and local liquidity shortfalls can be met through support from these hubs. Transfers of liquidity capacity between entities are subject to the approval framework involving the Group's liquidity steering function as well as the local liquidity managers considering the compliance with Pillar 1 metrics like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as well as stressed Net Liquidity Position (sNLP), which is a Pillar 2 metric. Available surplus that resides in entities with restriction to transfer liquidity to other Group entities, for example due to regulatory lending requirements, is treated as trapped and as such not considered in the calculation of the consolidated Group liquidity surplus.\n\nThe Management Board is informed about the Group's performance against the key liquidity metrics, including the risk appetite and internal and market indicators, via a weekly liquidity dashboard.\n\n## Liquidity risk monitoring and management\n\nFinance - Liquidity & Treasury Reporting & Analysis (LTRA) and Finance - Global Reporting - LTRA together have overall accountability for the accurate and timely production of both external regulatory liquidity reporting (Pillar 1) as well as internal management reporting  (Pillar  2)  for  liquidity  risk  of  the  Group.  In  addition,  Liquidity  &  Treasury  Reporting  &  Analysis  is responsible for the development of management information systems and the related analysis to support the liquidity risk framework and its governance for Treasury and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nThe LCR which is also a key limit is intended to promote the short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile over a 30day stress scenario. The ratio is defined as the amount of High-Quality Liquid Assets that could be used to raise liquidity in a stressed scenario, measured against the total volume of net cash outflows, arising from both contractual and prescribed modelled exposures over a 30-day time horizon on a consolidated currency basis.\n\nBy maintaining a ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, the LCR seeks to ensure that the Group holds adequate liquidity resources to mitigate a short-term liquidity stress.\n\nKey differences between the internal liquidity stress test (sNLP) and the LCR include the time horizon (eight weeks versus 30 days), the classification and haircut differences between debt securities within the sNLP and the LCR High-Quality Liquid Assets, outflow rates for various categories of funding, as well as inflow assumption for various assets (for example, loan repayments). The Group's internal liquidity stress test also includes outflows related to intraday liquidity assumptions, which are not explicitly reflected in the LCR.",

        "page_content": "## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio is a regulatory metric for assessing a Bank's structural funding profile. The NSFR is intended to reduce medium to long-term funding risks by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities. The ratio is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding (the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be a stable source of funding), relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding (a function of the liquidity characteristics of various assets held).\n\nBased on risk appetite a NSFR key limit has been set for the Group as well as for all Key Liquidity Entities and liquidity relevant entities subject to a respective regulatory requirement to ensure compliance to it.\n\n## Liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis\n\nGlobal internal liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis is used for measuring liquidity risk and evaluating the Group's short-term liquidity position within the liquidity framework. This complements the daily operational cash management process. The long-term liquidity strategy based on contractual and behavioral modelled cash flow information is represented by a longterm metric known as the Funding Matrix (refer to Funding risk management and funding diversification below).\n\nThe global liquidity stress testing process is managed by Treasury towards a respective risk appetite. Treasury is responsible for the design of the overall methodology, the choice of liquidity risk drivers and the determination of appropriate assumptions (parameters) to translate input data into stress testing output. Liquidity Risk Management is responsible for the definition of the  stress  scenarios.  Under  the  principles  and  policy  requirements  laid  out  by  Model  Risk  Management,  Liquidity  Risk Management  and  Model  Risk  Management  perform  the  independent  validation  of  liquidity  risk  models  and  non-model estimates.  Finance  -Liquidity  &  Treasury  Reporting  &  Analysis  and  Finance  -  Global  Reporting  are  responsible  for implementing these methodologies and performing the stress test calculation in conjunction with Treasury, Liquidity Risk Management, Group Strategic Analytics and IT.\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to describe and evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on the Group's liquidity position. Deutsche Bank has selected four scenarios to calculate the Group's stressed Net Liquidity Position. These scenarios are designed to capture potential outcomes which may be experienced by the Group. The most severe scenario  assesses  the  potential  consequences  of  a  combined  market-wide  and  idiosyncratic  stress  event,  including downgrades of Deutsche Bank credit rating. Under each of the scenarios, the impact of a liquidity stress event over different time horizons and across multiple liquidity risk drivers, covering all business lines and product areas and with that all portfolios and balance sheet, is considered. The output from this scenario analysis feeds the Group Wide Stress Test, which considers the impact of scenarios across all risk stripes.\n\nIn addition, potential funding requirements from contingent liquidity risks which can arise under stress, including drawdowns on  lending  facilities,  increased  collateral  requirements  under  derivative  agreements,  and  outflows  from  deposits  with  a contractual rating linked trigger are included in the analysis. Subsequently, countermeasures, which are the actions the Group would  take  to  counterbalance  the  outflows  incurred  during  a  stress  event,  are  taken  into  consideration.  Those countermeasures  include  the  usage  of  the  Group's  liquidity  reserve  and  generating  liquidity  from  other  unencumbered, marketable assets without causing any material impact on the Group's business model.\n\nStress testing is conducted at a global level and for defined entities relevant for liquidity risk management. The stress analysis covers an eight-week stress horizon which is considered to be the most critical time span during a liquidity crisis requiring that liquidity is actively assessed and steered on a Group level. In addition to the consolidated currency stress test, further stress tests are performed for material currencies. On a global level and in the U.S. liquidity stress tests a twelve-months period is covered. Additionally, stress test results are monitored over a twelve-month period with specific risk limits, if required by local regulators. Ad-hoc analysis may be conducted to reflect the impact of potential downside events that could affect the Group such as climate / ESG-related events. Relevant stress assumptions are applied to reflect liquidity flows from risk drivers and on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet products. The suite of stress testing scenarios and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated when enhancements are made to stress testing methodologies.\n\nComplementing the daily liquidity stress testing, the Group also conducts regular group-wide stress tests run by Enterprise Risk Management, which analyze liquidity risks in conjunction with the other defined risk types and evaluate their impact and interplay to both capital and liquidity positions as described in 'Risk and Capital Framework - Stress testing'.",

        "page_content": "## Funding Risk Management and Funding Diversification\n\n## Funding Management\n\nIn line with regulatory guidelines, Deutsche Bank has developed a set of internal indicators to measure its inherent funding risks. These are considered for steering purposes in addition to the regulatory metric Net Stable Funding Ratio.\n\nThe Group relies on a vast range of funding sources such as e.g. deposits, unsecured wholesale funding, Capital Markets Issuances and secured funding. These protect its liquidity position twofold. Firstly, since stress events may impact funding markets differently, maintaining a well-diversified funding portfolio will lower the average impact of these. Secondly, when experiencing liquidity stress, having access to a wide range of funding sources significantly improves the Group's ability to tap different funding markets. The diversification across products is complemented by Risk thresholds in order to monitor tenor concentration and counterparty concentration for both secured and unsecured funding sources.\n\nIn addition, the stability of Deutsche Bank Group's funding position can be negatively impacted by various forms of industry risks. These are typically medium to long term structural trends with potentially significant long-term impact on the economy and consequently on banks' balance sheets. Deutsche Bank is performing ad-hoc analyzes on such emerging risks to assess the impact of such trends on its funding position to ensure that mitigating measures will be taken well in time when deemed necessary. In addition, Treasury evaluates current market access information in its significant funding markets on a regular basis. Market access information is compiled monthly and presented to Group Asset and Liability Committee.\n\nThe Group's primary internal tool for monitoring and managing structural funding risk is the Funding Matrix. The Funding Matrix assesses the Group's structural funding profile over a time horizon beyond one year. To produce the Funding Matrix, all  funding-relevant  assets  and  liabilities  are  mapped  into  time  buckets  corresponding  to  their  contractual  or  modelled maturities. This allows the Group to identify expected excesses and shortfalls in term liabilities over assets in each time bucket, facilitating the management of potential liquidity exposures.\n\nThe liquidity profile is based on contractual cash flow information. If the contractual maturity profile of a product does not adequately reflect the liquidity profile, it is replaced by modelling assumptions. Short-term balance sheet items (less than one year) or matched funded structures (asset and liabilities directly matched with no liquidity risk) are excluded from the term analysis.\n\nThe bottom-up assessment by individual business line is combined with a top-down reconciliation against the Group's IFRS balance sheet. From the cumulative term profile of assets and liabilities beyond 1 year, long-funded surpluses or short-funded gaps in the Group's maturity structure can be identified. The cumulative profile is thereby built up starting from the 'greater than ten-year' bucket down to the 'greater than one-year' bucket. The Funding Matrix is also undertaken for material foreign currencies i.e. USD.\n\nTo diversify our refinancing activities Deutsche Bank actively uses among others Capital Markets Issuance.\n\n## Capital Markets Issuance\n\nThe main objective of debt issuance is to raise medium term funding and securing in the most cost optimal manner. Debt issuance, encompassing senior unsecured bonds, covered bonds, and capital securities, is a key source of term funding for the  Group  and  is  managed  directly  by  Treasury.  At  least  once  a  year,  following  endorsement  by  the  Asset  and  Liability Committee, Treasury submits an annual long-term funding plan to the Group Risk Committee for recommendation and then to  Management Board for approval. This plan is driven by global and local funding and liquidity  requirements  based  on expected business development. The Group's capital markets issuance portfolio is dynamically managed through annual issuance plans to avoid excessive maturity concentrations.\n\nDeutsche Bank holds a license to issue mortgage Pfandbriefe and maintains a program to issue structured covered bonds. Additionally, the Group continues to run a program for the purpose of issuing covered bonds under Spanish law (Cedulas). In 2023, Deutsche Bank further diversified its investor base through inaugural transactions in China (so-called Panda bonds). Since 2020 the Group maintains its Green Bond framework which the bank continuously expands to offer green note issuances to both, institutional and retail investors. Furthermore, multiple green structured notes, first green deposits and first green repurchase agreements (repos) were executed. In 2023, the Group concluded on integrating the legacy bond portfolio from former Postbank activities into Deutsche Bank's infrastructure, leading to a uniform platform for all issuances.",

HQLA comprise available cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered high quality liquid securities (including government and government guaranteed bonds), representing the most readily available and most important countermeasure in a stress event.\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's HQLA are held centrally across major currencies at the central bank accounts of the parent entity and foreign branches in the key locations in which we are active and in a dedicated Treasury-owned Strategic Liquidity Reserves portfolio, set up exclusively to serve as a mitigant during periods of stress.\n\n## Asset Encumbrance\n\nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Generally, loans are encumbered to support long-term capital markets secured issuance such as covered bonds or other self-securitization structures, while financing debt and equity inventory on a secured basis is a regular activity for the Investment Bank business. Additionally, in line with the European Banking Authority technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets pledged with settlement systems (including  default  funds  and  initial  margins)  as  well  as  other  assets  pledged  which  cannot  be  freely  withdrawn  such  as mandatory minimum reserves at central banks are considered encumbered assets. Derivative margin receivable assets as encumbered under these European Banking Authority guidelines are also included.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nThe funds transfer pricing framework is key to incentivize liquidity steering activities to the business units. It applies to all Corporate Divisions and entities with balance sheet items requiring active management and funding from the Group and promotes pricing of (i) assets in accordance with their underlying liquidity risk, (ii) liabilities in accordance with their liquidity value and (iii) contingent liquidity exposures in accordance with the cost of providing for appropriate High Quality Liquid Assets.\n\nWithin this framework funding and liquidity risk costs and benefits are allocated to the Group's business units based on rates which reflect the economic costs of liquidity for Deutsche Bank. Treasury might set further financial incentives in line with the Group's liquidity risk guidelines. While the framework promotes a diligent Group-wide allocation of its funding costs to the liquidity users, it also provides an incentive-based framework for businesses generating stable long-term and stress compliant funding.\n\nThroughout 2023, the Bank continued to deliver against improvements of the changes to the internal Funds Transfer Pricing framework started in 2019 aimed at enhancing its effectiveness as a management tool, as well as better supporting funding cost optimization. Additional details are included in Note 4 'Business segments and related information' of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Contingency Funding Planning\n\nDeutsche Bank's Group Contingency Funding Plan outlines how Deutsche Bank would respond to an actual or anticipated liquidity stress event. It specifies the provisions, procedures and action plans for responding to potential disruptions to the Bank's ability to fund itself. It covers actions that can be taken to raise cash and/or recover the Bank's liquidity metrics in breach. The Contingency Funding Plan outlines governance arrangements for its activation and presents the framework of liquidity indicators enabling the Bank to identify deteriorating market circumstances in a timely manner and that determine quickly what actions need to be taken, incl. communication and coordination during a liquidity stress event. Deutsche Bank has established the Financial Resource Management Council, which is responsible for oversight of capital and liquidity across contingency, recovery, and resolution scenarios in a defined crisis situation.",

Key responsibilities include:\n\n- -Defining the overarching risk management policy, including setting of risk management standards.\n- -Setting and monitoring the Bank's overarching risk appetite and cascading to business & entity dimensions.\n- -Delivering insight through emerging risks and trends analysis, forward-looking stress tests, portfolio concentration, deepdive analyses and ad-hoc event reporting.\n- -Overseeing the Bank's internal capital adequacy process, including capital risk appetite.\n- -Coordinating and implementing the group recovery plan and maintaining credible resolution plans that could be executed in a crisis.\n- -Developing and managing the climate risk management framework.\n- -Providing risk reporting and analytics to key stakeholders, including senior management and regulators.\n- -Acting as risk controlling function for credit risk.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a shortfall in planned earnings (excluding other material risks) due to incorrect business plans, ineffective plan execution, or inability to effectively respond to material plan deviations. Strategic risk arises from the exposure of  the  bank  to  the  macroeconomic environment, changes in the competitive landscape, and regulatory and technological developments. Additionally, it  could occur due to errors in strategic positioning, the bank's failure to execute its planned strategy and/or a failure to effectively address underperformance versus plan targets.\n\nThe strategic plan is developed annually and presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan is presented to the Supervisory Board. The plan is challenged in an iterative process with respect to its assumptions, credibility and integrity. During the year, execution of business strategies is regularly monitored to assess the performance against targets. A more comprehensive description of this process is detailed in the section 'Strategic and Capital Plan'.\n\nStrategic risk is  measured through a dedicated risk model that quantifies potential losses caused by unexpected pre-tax earnings shortfalls that cannot be offset by cost reductions under extreme but plausible market conditions over a 12-month period. Strategic risk appetite is also established for the Group via dedicated metrics.\n\nThe Business Divisions and Infrastructure Functions are the 1 st LoD that own the risk and have the responsibility to manage strategic risk in accordance with the plan approved by the Management Board. Finance and Risk are the 2 nd LoD and act as facilitators via their controlling activities, and are responsible for escalation to the appropriate decision-taking authorities.\n\n## Capital risk\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that Deutsche Bank has an insufficient level or composition of capital supply to support its current and planned business activities and associated risks during normal and stressed conditions.\n\nThe bank's capital risk framework consists of several elements which aim to ensure that Deutsche Bank maintains on an ongoing basis an adequate capitalization to cover the risks to which is exposed. The framework is strongly integrated with the bank-wide strategic planning process and closely linked to Deutsche Bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process (see section 'Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process' for further details). Treasury together with the divisions is the key risk manager of the associated risks and represents the 1 st LoD. ERM acts as the 2 nd LoD for capital risk.\n\nTreasury function  manages capital  risk  at  group  level  and  locally  in  each  region,  as  applicable.  This  includes  managing issuances and repurchases of capital instruments (see section on 'Capital management' for details). Additionally, divisional limits for key capital resources are approved by the Group Asset and Liability Committee to ensure alignment with the capital risk appetite (see section on 'Resource limit setting' for details).\n\nERM sets the capital risk framework, assesses the capital risk profile and provides independent challenge. This includes setting of risk appetite thresholds for key capital ratios. Threshold breaches are subject to a dedicated governance framework triggering management actions up to the execution of Deutsche Bank's recovery plan. Thresholds also provide boundaries to the capital plan and are fully integrated into the regular assessment of capital risk under stress scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Portfolio concentration risk\n\nRisk concentrations refer to clusters of the same or similar risk drivers within specific risk types (intra-risk concentrations in credit, market, operational and strategic risks) as well as across different risk types (inter-risk concentrations). They occur within and across counterparties, businesses, regions/countries, industries and products. The management and monitoring of risk concentrations is achieved through a quantitative and qualitative approach, as follows:\n\n- -Intra-risk concentrations are assessed, monitored and mitigated by the individual risk functions (enterprise, credit, market, operational and liquidity risk management). This is supported by risk appetite including limit setting on different levels and/or management according to each risk type\n- -Inter-risk  concentrations  are  managed  through  quantitative  top-down  stress-testing  and  qualitative  bottom-up  reviews, identifying and assessing risk themes independent of any risk type and providing a holistic view across the bank. The diversification effects between credit, market, operational and strategic risk are measured through a dedicated risk model that quantifies the diversification benefit caused by non-perfect correlations between these risk types. The calculation of the risk type diversification benefit is intended to ensure that the standalone economic capital figures for the individual risk types are aggregated in an economically meaningful way\n\nThe most senior governance body for the oversight of risk concentrations is the Group Risk Committee (GRC).\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nThe impacts of rising global temperatures, the enhanced focus on climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy from society, regulators and the banking sector have led to the emergence of new and increasing sources of financial and non-financial risks. These include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events, which are growing in frequency and severity, as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher taxation, reduced demand and potentially restricted access to financing. These risks can impact Deutsche Bank across a broad range of financial and non-financial risk types.\n\nFinancial institutions are facing increased scrutiny on climate and broader ESG-related issues from governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies, leading to reputational risks if the Group is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to protect biodiversity and human rights. Deutsche Bank is reviewing and enhancing its ESG risk management frameworks  in  alignment  with  regulatory  guidance  and  to  ensure  that  we  actively  manage  ESG  risks  and  prevent greenwashing. Data, methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks are still evolving or, in certain cases, are not yet available. This, combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry, remains partially reliant on proxy estimates and qualitative approaches when assessing these risks which introduces a higher degree of uncertainty into climate-related disclosures.\n\nFinancial institutions are facing increased scrutiny as well as reporting requirements on climate and broader ESG-related issues from governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies. This can lead to reputational risks if the bank is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy or is perceived to be heavily involved in the financing of activities harmful to nature or linked to human rights abuse within supply chains.\n\nCertain  jurisdictions  have  begun  to  develop  anti-ESG  measures  including  requiring  financial  institutions  that  wish  to  do business  with  them  to  certify  their  non-adherence  to  aspects  of  the  transition  agenda.  Failing  to  comply  with  these requirements  may  result  in  the  termination  of  existing  business  and  the  inability  to  conduct  new  business  with  those jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks.\n\nDeutsche Bank is committed to managing its business activities and operations in a sustainable manner, including aligning its portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. In October, Deutsche Bank published its Initial Transition Plan (*), which documents the strategy that the bank has developed to decarbonize its operations, its upstream supply chain and its financing portfolio. In the plan the Group also disclosed net-zero aligned decarbonization pathways for three additional carbon intensive sectors compared to 2022, bringing the total number of sectors covered by portfolio targets to seven: Oil and Gas (upstream), Power Generation, Automotive (light duty vehicles), Steel, Coal mining, Cement and Shipping. Targets and metrics disclosed in the bank's Transition Plan are integrated into the Group-wide risk management framework, appetite and controls.",

        "page_content": "## Model Risk Management\n\n## Introduction\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect estimation approaches (covering models and non-model estimates) or their misused outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business or strategic decision making, or damage to its reputation. Deutsche Bank recognizes the use of estimation approaches can affect other risk-types, and that model risk is a distinct risk that can increase or decrease aggregate risk across other risk-types.\n\nDeutsche Bank uses estimation approaches for a broad range of decision-making activities, such as: underwriting credits; valuing exposures, instruments, and positions; measuring risk; managing and safeguarding client assets and determining capital and reserve adequacy. The term 'estimation approach' refers to a 'model' or 'non-model estimate' that is a quantitative or qualitative method, system, or approach that applies expert judgement, statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Estimation approaches are simplified representations of real-world relationships and are based on assumptions and judgment. Accordingly, the Bank is exposed to model risk, which must be identified, measured, and controlled appropriately.\n\nModel risk management oversight is provided by all levels of management, including the Management Board. Management of model risk is underpinned by a framework designed and monitored by a 2nd Line of Defense control function independent from developer, owner, and user of estimation approaches.\n\n## Model Risk Management Framework and Governance\n\nModel risk is one of the Bank's Level 1 risks, and is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer through the setting of a quantitative and qualitative risk appetite statement, and managed through:\n\n- -The Model Risk Policy and Procedure, and supporting documents aligned to risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and industry best practice, with clear roles and responsibilities for stakeholders\n- -Inventorization  of  all  estimation  approaches,  supporting  ongoing  model  risk  framework  components  including  risk assessments and attestations\n- -Key controls for estimation approaches from development through to decommissioning, including validation, approval, deployment and monitoring\n- -Independent  Validations,  and  subsequent  independent  approvals,  verify  that  estimation  approaches  have  been appropriately designed and implemented for their intended scope and purpose, and that respective controls are in place to assure that they continue to perform as expected during their use\n- -The  controls  identify  estimation  approaches'  limitations  and  weaknesses,  resulting  in  findings  and  compensating controls, these may be conditions for use, such as adjustments or overlays\n- -Model risk governance, including senior forums for monitoring and escalation of model risk related topics, as well as monthly updates to the Management Board on the model risk appetite metrics, and periodic model risk updates to the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Developments during the reporting period\n\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank elevated the status of model risk management with the Global Head of Model Risk Management joining the Executive Committee of the Chief Risk Officer and reporting directly into the CRO. This manifests the importance of model risk for the Bank and is reflective of model risk being a Level 1 risk for the Bank.\n\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank consolidated the Model Inventory systems further on the strategic bank-wide model risk platform replacing all historic inventories going forward. This single platform aligns model risk data across the Bank and supports compliance to the model risk framework, including key measurements, controls, and mitigation of model risks.",

        "page_content": "## Reputational Risk Management\n\nWithin the group's risk management process, reputational risk is defined as the risk of possible damage to Deutsche Bank's brand and reputation, and the associated risk to earnings, capital or liquidity arising from any association, action or inaction which could be perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate, unethical or inconsistent with the Deutsche Bank's values and beliefs.\n\nDeutsche Bank has limited appetite for transactions or relationships with material reputational risk or in areas which inherently pose a higher reputational  risk  such  as  the  defense,  gaming,  or  adult  entertainment  sectors,  or  where  there  are  certain environmental concerns. Reputational risk cannot be precluded as it can be driven by unforeseeable changes in perception of its practices by its various stakeholders (e.g. public, clients, shareholders and regulators).\n\nThe Reputational Risk Framework (the Framework) is in place to manage the process through which active decisions are taken on matters which may pose a reputational risk, before the event, and in doing so to prevent damage to Deutsche Bank's reputation  wherever  possible.  The  Framework  provides  consistent  standards  for  the  identification,  assessment  and management of reputational risk issues. Reputational impacts which may arise as a consequence of a failure from another risk type, control or process are addressed separately via the associated risk type framework and are therefore not addressed in this section.\n\nThe reputational risk could arise from multiple sources including, but not limited to, potential issues with the profile of the counterparty, the business purpose / economic substance of the transaction or product, high risk industries, environmental and social considerations, and the nature of the transaction or product or its structure and terms.\n\nThe modelling and quantitative measurement of reputational risk internal capital is implicitly covered in the bank's economic capital framework primarily within strategic risk.\n\n## Governance and Organizational Structure\n\nThe Framework is applicable to all business units and regions. Matters specific to DWS are reviewed by a DWS reputational risk committee and, if necessary, escalated to the DWS Executive Board, which can escalate matters to the management board of Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nWhilst every employee has a responsibility to protect the bank's reputation, the primary responsibility for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and, if necessary, referring or reporting of reputational risk matters lies with Deutsche Bank's Business Divisions as the primary risk owners. Each Business Division has an established process through which matters, which are deemed to be a moderate or greater reputational risk are assessed, the Unit Reputational Risk Assessment Process.\n\nThe  Unit  RRAP  is  required  to  refer  any  material  reputational  risk  matters  to  the  respective  Regional  Reputational  Risk Committee. The Framework also sets out a number of matters which are considered inherently higher risk from a reputational risk  perspective  and  are  therefore  mandatory  referrals  to  the  Regional  Reputational  Risk  Committees.  The  Regional Reputational Risk Committees, which are 2nd LoD Committees, are responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of reputational risk in the respective region of Deutsche Bank. The Regional Reputational Risk Committees meet, as a minimum, on a quarterly basis with ad hoc meetings as required. The Group Reputational Risk Committee (GRRC) is responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of reputational risk  at  Deutsche  Bank  on  behalf  of  the  Group  Risk  Committee  and  the  Management  Board.  Additionally,  the  Group Reputational Risk Committee reviews cases with a Group wide impact and in exceptional circumstances, those that could not be resolved at a regional level.",

        "page_content": "## Cybersecurity\n\n## Cybersecurity governance\n\nResponsibility for cybersecurity matters sits within the Chief Security Office, where it forms the first Line of Defense (1 st LoD) within Deutsche Bank's Three Lines of Defense ('3LoD') model. The Chief Security Officer has delegated authority from the Management Board and reports directly to the Chief Technology, Data, and Innovation Officer, who is a member of the Management Board.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Chief Security Officer has served in various roles in information security for more than 20 years. This includes the role as global Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) / Chief Security Officer (CSO) for three different large European financial institutions and a partner position in a global strategy and consulting firm, leading security work for financial service clients.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer is supported by information security role holders at various seniority levels to help ensure that security requirements are met from a regional, divisional, and technical perspective. All information security activities are overseen by two dedicated governance fora chaired by the Chief Security Officer: the Group IT Security Council (interface to the  bank's  IT  units),  and  the  Group  Information  Security  Committee  (interface  to  the  bank's  business  and  infrastructure divisions). Furthermore, both fora oversee the information security posture of Deutsche Bank against defined targets, the progress and performance of key information security deliverables, the remediation status of information security related audit findings and current information security incidents. They also endorse the information security strategy and act as the highest escalation level within the Chief Security Office.\n\nThe  Chief  Security  Office  develops  the  bank's  group-wide  security  strategy  and  oversees  its  implementation  and operationalization globally via the organizational set-up, governance, and implemented security policies. The security strategy is  reviewed  continually  to  address  changes  in  the  threat  landscape,  technology,  the  regulatory  environment,  the  bank's corporate and IT strategy, and other internal and external parameters. Deutsche Bank's security strategy framework provides comprehensive and layered security controls. This framework is strengthened by a threat-driven approach to direct and adjust the security investment, including the continual review and assessment of the maturity of the bank's security implementation.\n\nThe Chief Security Office maintains a comprehensive metrics and reporting framework, underpinned by an extensive data set allowing for global, regional, and divisional views. Security metrics and reporting provided to the bank's governance fora at all seniority  levels  support  appropriate  security  risk  awareness  and  decision  taking.  The  Management  Board  receives  a comprehensive quarterly information security risk posture report, as well as ad hoc information if required. Furthermore, the Chief Security Officer provides regular updates on material topics relating to security to the Supervisory Board's Committee responsible for Technology, Data and Innovation.\n\nInformation Security Risk is managed as an Operational Risk under the Non-Financial Risk Management Framework of the bank.  The  Chief  Security  Office,  in  its  responsibility  as  1st  LoD,  executes  against  the  Non-Financial  Risk  Management Framework and leverages its various instruments (e.g., an annual Risk & Control Assessment) whereas the Non-Financial Risk Management as second Line of Defense (2nd LoD) provides oversight, review, and challenge. Accordingly, part of the Non-Financial  Risk  Committee's  (NFRC)  remit  is  to  oversee  and  govern  Deutsche  Bank's  cybersecurity  risk  profile, remediation programs and risk tolerance. Also, 2nd LoD is represented in both 1st LoD fora described above.\n\nIn alignment with its Non-Financial Risk Management policies, Deutsche Bank's security policy framework defines the core principles of security risk management and the fundamentals for security management. The complete framework is reviewed annually, and any changes are endorsed by the Group Information Security Committee. The framework is governed centrally and applied globally across all product groups and business and infrastructure divisions. The framework includes a clear description of the risk tolerance related to information security. It also sets out the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of key personnel identified to manage information security risk; the strategy and measures to cope with information security breaches, and related communication procedure.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, the bank's Information Security Management System has been certified according to ISO 27001 for all information security  domains  defined  in  that  standard  since  2012.  To  maintain  the  ISO  27001  certification,  the  bank  performs  a  full recertification process every three years, with the latest taking place in 2021. In the years a full certification process does not take place, the bank performs a certification-follow-up, designed to ensure compliance between certification intervals. The latest certification follow-up was in 2023. The next full recertification will take place in September 2024.\n\nDeutsche Bank employs a variety of mechanisms to self-identify areas for improvements and control enhancements. These include  security  testing,  security  problem  management  and  lessons  learned.  The  effectiveness  of  the  bank's  overall information security program is evaluated on a regular basis by third-party organizations that compare the bank's approach with industry benchmarks. Deutsche Bank's independent Group Audit function frequently includes the assessment of security controls in its audit plan.\n\n## Identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threats\n\nDeutsche Bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digitization and a continually evolving landscape related to cybersecurity threats. Due to the dynamics and complexity of the current environment, the bank is continuously monitoring the  security  threat  landscape.  The  bank  vigilantly  observes  technological  developments,  the  geopolitical  landscape  and economic impacts driving security risks and assesses their relevance for potential impacts to Deutsche Bank and the wider financial ecosystem.\n\nDeutsche Bank has a variety of prevention methods and controls in place, such as threat intelligence, data leakage prevention, cyber hygiene, and encryption solutions. These also include placing a strong emphasis on detection, backed by a robust incident-response process. The bank actively shares best practices and threat information with national and international security organizations, government authorities, and peer organizations. These relationships help to ensure that the bank's security technology and procedures reflect current industry best practices and keep pace with the threat environment.\n\nDeutsche Bank's security incident management covers cybersecurity events that may affect the bank, its clients, business partners, or employees. The related management and reporting processes performed with the involvement of Compliance, Legal and Group Data Privacy are designed to enable a quick and effective response to cyberattacks and information security threats. The objective is to minimize loss, leakage, or disruption and to use insights gained from the handling of incidents to continuously improve the bank's processes. The worldwide distributed Cyber Intelligence and Response Centers in AsiaPacific, Europe and America allow detection of threats and response to incidents worldwide by 24/7 operations.\n\nTo address evolving security threats, the bank continually reviews and enhances its information security controls into every layer  of  technology,  including  identity  and  access  management,  data,  infrastructure,  devices,  and  applications.  This  is complemented by organizational controls and security training and awareness. The purpose of this layered approach is to provide end-to-end protection, as well as multiple opportunities to detect, prevent, respond to, and recover from cyberthreats.\n\nSecurity risks are assessed on a regular basis, at least annually, taking internal as well as external risk drivers and events dynamically into account. A thorough analysis of the external threat landscape, which leverages industry standard threat assessment frameworks, provides a foundation for the assessment of financial industry relevant risk scenarios. These are evaluated against the bank's capabilities to cope with these risks. In case of emerging developments, additional risk reviews are conducted. As part of the annual risk and control assessment process, subject matter experts provide a risk description, and are supported by other areas such as Legal, Compliance or Group Data Privacy, as necessary. Senior information security experts from all divisions and functions assess the exposure of the Group, based on their divisional or functional background. The process considers contextual data such as major events, threat assessments, findings, scenario analysis, control metrics, lessons learned, read across, regulatory expectations and remediation activities when assessing control suites and residual risk positions. Measures for the further reduction of material residual risks may include policy changes or policy amendments at divisional or group level as well as prioritized investment and accelerated implementation of risk mitigating activities.\n\nReliance on third parties' products and services that support critical operations can affect the bank's risk posture, because these can be the target of new and evolving cybersecurity attacks. This risk, along with expanded regulatory requirements, has necessitated an increased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties and where necessary, pro-actively perform outreach with them. Deutsche Bank manages third party information security risks by means of its global third-party risk management program. This program includes an information security policy specifically for third parties  that  sets  forth  the  bank's  control  objectives  and  expectations.  Additionally,  Deutsche  Bank  has  a  third-party  risk management process designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks arising from working with third parties, which includes the bank's oversight of third parties' operations related to the services provided to the bank.",

        "page_content": "## Material and potentially material impacts from cybersecurity threats\n\nDeutsche Bank's cybersecurity threats are mainly related to the risk of breaches in confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the banks or clients' information, which includes breaches of the security of third-party computer systems. Breaches can occur due to unauthorized access to networks or resources, the introduction of computer viruses or malware, or other forms of cybersecurity attacks or incidents, including regulatory, geopolitical, operational, and third-party risk.\n\nDeutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment, including errors in the performance of processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, which may disrupt business and lead to material losses. At the same time, the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage, if services are not provided as agreed, or in line with internal standards, which could result in regulatory penalties and financial losses. Cyberattacks could impact Deutsche Bank both directly and indirectly including impacts from third parties.\n\nThe  increasing  frequency  and  sophistication  of  recent  cyberattacks  has  resulted  in  an  elevated  risk  profile  for  many organizations around the world including Deutsche Bank. Significant attention by the bank's management has been paid to the overall level of preparedness against such attacks. Cybersecurity continues as a focus area due to factors such as the continued and increasing reliance on the bank's technology environment, as well as potential risks arising from the need for digital innovation, such as the usage of public cloud services, artificial intelligence, or quantum computing.\n\nThe technological advancements also pose demands on data privacy, security, and other information security risks. As the use of artificial intelligence becomes widespread, there are also increased risks to cybersecurity: denial of service, the criminal use of deepfakes, and more sophisticated social engineering attacks. Cybercrime groups may have the capability to use machine learning techniques to automate the deployment and operation of malware campaigns.\n\nFinancially motivated and other sophisticated cyberattacks, including ransomware, can be observed as persistent threats across  industries  and  are  expected  to  become  more  frequent.  Additional  threats  are  posed  by  supply  chain  attacks,  an increasing  frequency  of  critical  software  vulnerabilities  potentially  exploited  by  threat  actors  (zero-day  exploits),  and  an expanding threat surface introduced by, for example, remote ways of working or the usage of cloud services.\n\nDeutsche  Bank  experienced  attacks  on  computer  systems,  including  attacks  aimed  at  obtaining  unauthorized  access  to confidential company or client information, damaging, or interfering with company data, resources, or business activities, or otherwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure, including attacks that occurred at the  bank's third-party providers. In 2023, the bank did not experience any material effect on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition as a result of an information security incident, including an attempted cyberattack. Deutsche Bank expects to continue to be the target of such attacks in the future and may not be able to effectively anticipate or prevent more material attacks from occurring in the future.\n\nAs a result, cyberattacks could lead to technology failures, security breaches, unauthorized access, unavailability of services, data loss, data destruction, and the inaccessibility of data and/or systems. This includes internal and third-parties information technology systems. A successful cyberattack could have a significant negative impact on the bank that may result in the disclosure or misuse of client as well as proprietary information, damage to or inability to access information technology systems, financial losses, remediation costs (such as for investigation and reestablishing services), increased cybersecurity costs (such as for additional personnel, technology, or third-party vendors), personal data breach notification obligations, reputational damage, client dissatisfaction and potential regulatory penalties or litigation exposure.",

The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as well as in the section 'Development of risk-weighted assets' is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation.\n\nThis section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to the CRR and the German Banking Act ('Kreditwesengesetz' or 'KWG'), which does not include insurance companies and companies outside the finance sector.\n\nThe total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2023 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\nCET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to regulatory  adjustments  (i.e.,  prudential  filters  and  deductions),  as  well  as  minority  interests  qualifying  for  inclusion  in consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains on  sale,  cash  flow  hedges  and  changes  in  the  value  of  own  liabilities,  and  additional  value  adjustments.  CET 1  capital deductions for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, (reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of financial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.\n\nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a trigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem, institution must have full dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc.\n\nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature.\n\n## Capital instruments\n\nThe Management Board was authorized by the 2022 Annual General Meeting to buy, on or before April 30, 2027, shares of up to 10% of the share capital at the time this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time the authorization was exercised. As at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to a volume of up to 206.6 million shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, including derivatives with a volume of up to 2% of the total share capital with a maturity exceeding 18 months. During the period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until the 2023 Annual General Meeting, 36.3 million shares were purchased for equity compensation purposes in the same period or upcoming periods. Thereof, 22.7 million shares were purchased by exercising  call  options.  In  addition,  30.2 million  new  call  options  were  purchased  for  equity  compensation  purposes  in upcoming periods. The number of shares held in Treasury amounted to 5.0 million as of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. These shares were held for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.",

        "page_content": "The Annual General Meeting on May 17 , 2023 granted the Management Board the approval to buy, on or before April 30, 2028, shares of up to 10% of the share capital at the time of this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time the authorization was exercised. As at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to 204 million shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 102 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, including  derivatives  with  a  volume  of  up  to  2%  of  the  total  share  capital  with  a  maturity  exceeding  18  months.  These authorizations replaced the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2023 Annual General Meeting until December 31,  2023,  45.5 million  shares  were  purchased  for  cancellation  with  the  purpose  of  distributing  capital  to shareholders. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 48.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Thereof 45.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.7 million shares relates to shares to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.\n\nSince the 2017 Annual General Meeting, renewed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting, and as of December 31, 2023, authorized capital available to the Management Board is \u20ac 2,560 million (1,000 million shares).\n\nSince the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Management Board is authorized to issue participatory notes and other hybrid debt  securities  that  fulfill  the  regulatory  requirements  to  qualify  as  Additional  Tier 1  capital  with  an  equivalent  value  of \u20ac 9.0 billion  on  or  before  April  30,  2027.  Deutsche  Bank  issued  \u20ac 1.25 billion  new  AT1  notes  under  this  authorization  in November 2022.\n\nThe current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until December 31, 2021. In 2023, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2023, which resulted in no material difference between the 'fully loaded' and 'transitional' amounts.\n\nBased on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of \u20ac 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2023. In 2023, the bank did not issue or redeem AT1 notes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to \u20ac 8.6 billion (nominal value of \u20ac 11.5 billion). In 2023, the bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value U.S. $ 1.5 billion (equivalent amount of \u20ac 1.4 billion) and a notional of \u20ac 132.5 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers\n\nThe Pillar 1 CET 1 minimum capital requirement applicable to the Group is 4.50% of RWA. The Pillar 1 total capital requirement of 8.00% demands further resources that may be met with up to 1.50% Additional Tier 1 capital and up to 2.00% Tier 2 capital.\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy requirements in 2023.\n\nIn addition to these minimum capital requirements, the following combined capital buffer requirements were fully effective beginning 2023 onwards. These buffer requirements must be met in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements but can be drawn down in times of economic stress.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer is implemented in Section 10c German Banking Act, based on Article 129 CRD and equals a requirement of 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2023 and onwards.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer is deployed in a jurisdiction when excess credit growth is associated with an increase in system-wide risk. It may vary between 0% and 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA. In exceptional cases, it could also be higher than  2.50%.  The  institution-specific  countercyclical  buffer  that  applies  to  Deutsche  Bank  is  the  weighted  average  of  the countercyclical capital buffers that apply in the jurisdictions where our relevant credit exposures are located. As per December 31, 2023, the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer was at 0.45%.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned buffers, national authorities, such as the BaFin, may require a systemic risk buffer to prevent and mitigate long-term non-cyclical systemic or macro-prudential risks that are not covered by the CRR. They can require an additional buffer of up to 5.00% CET 1 capital of RWA. As of the year end 2023, a systemic risk buffer applied to Deutsche Bank is 0.19%.",

        "page_content": "Deutsche Bank continues to be designated as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) by the BaFin in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, resulting in a G-SII buffer requirement of 1.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2023 based on the indicators as published in 2020. This assessment has been confirmed by the FSB in 2023. Further, BaFin has announced that the G-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche Bank will remain unchanged for the years 2024 and 2025\n\nAdditionally,  Deutsche  Bank  has  been  classified  by  BaFin  in  agreement  with  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank  as  an  'other systemically important institution' (O-SII) with an additional capital buffer requirement of 2.00% in 2023 that has to be met on a consolidated level. Hence, for Deutsche Bank, the O-SII buffer amounts to 2.00% in 2023. BaFin has announced O-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche bank remain unchanged for the year 2024.The higher of the buffers for systemically important institutions (G-SII buffer or O-SII buffer) must be applied.\n\nPursuant to the Pillar 2 SREP, the ECB may impose capital requirements on individual banks which are more stringent than statutory requirements (so-called Pillar 2 requirement).\n\nIn  December  2022,  the  ECB  informed  Deutsche  Bank  of  its  decision  effective  January  1,  2023,  that  the  bank's  Pillar 2 requirement changed compared to 2022. This results in ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA. As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 11.16%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 13.17%  and  a  Total  Capital  ratio  of  at  least  15.84%.  The  CET  1  requirement  comprises  the  Pillar  1  minimum  capital requirement  of  4.50%,  the  Pillar  2  requirement  (SREP  add-on)  of  1.52%,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.50%,  the countercyclical buffer of 0.45% and the systemic risk buffer of 0.19% (both subject to changes throughout the year) as well as the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.51%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.68%. Also, following the results of the 2023 SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, commonly referred to as the Pillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate from and in addition to the Pillar 2 requirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance although it is not legally binding, and failure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital distributions.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Deutsche Bank was informed by the ECB of its decision regarding prudential minimum capital requirements for 2024 that applies from January 1, 2024, onwards, following the results of the 2023 SREP. The decision set ECB's Pillar 2 requirement to 2.65% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2024, of which at least 1.49% must be covered by CET 1 capital and 1.99% by Tier 1 capital.\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the different Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 minimum capital buffer requirements (but excluding the Pillar 2 guidance) as applicable to Deutsche Bank for the years 2023 and 2024.\n\n## Overview total capital requirements and capital buffers\n\n|                                                                           | 2023   | 2024   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Pillar 1                                                                  |        |        |\n| Minimum CET 1 requirement                                                 | 4.50%  | 4.50%  |\n| Combined buffer requirement                                               | 5.14%  | 5.19%  |\n| Capital Conservation Buffer                                               | 2.50%  | 2.50%  |\n| Countercyclical Buffer\u00b9                                                   | 0.45%  | 0.50%  |\n| Systemic Risk Buffer\u00b2                                                     | 0.19%  | 0.19%  |\n| Maximum of:                                                               | 2.00%  | 2.00%  |\n| G-SII Buffer                                                              | 1.50%  | 1.50%  |\n| O-SII Buffer                                                              | 2.00%  | 2.00%  |\n| Pillar 2                                                                  |        |        |\n| Pillar 2 SREP Add-on of CET 1 capital (excluding the \"Pillar 2\" guidance) | 2.70%  | 2.65%  |\n| of which covered by CET 1 capital                                         | 1.52%  | 1.49%  |\n| of which covered by Tier 1 capital                                        | 2.03%  | 1.99%  |\n| of which covered by Tier 2 capital                                        | 0.68%  | 0.66%  |\n| Total CET 1 requirement from Pillar 1 and 2\u00b3                              | 11.16% | 11.18% |\n| Total Tier 1 requirement from Pillar 1 and 2                              | 13.17% | 13.18% |\n| Total capital requirement from Pillar 1 and 2                             | 15.84% | 15.84% |",

Tier 2 capital was \u20ac 0.9 billion lower as of December 31, 2023, amounted to \u20ac 8.6 billion compared to \u20ac 9.5 billion at the end of 2022. Total capital was \u20ac 1.1 billion lower as of December 31, 2023, amounted to \u20ac 65.0 billion compared to \u20ac 66.1 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nCET 1 capital was materially flat over the year with positive net profit of \u20ac 4.8 billion for the year 2023 offset by regulatory deductions for future common share dividend and AT1 coupon payments of \u20ac 1.3 billion which is in line with the ECB Decision (EU) (2015/656) on the recognition of interim or year-end profits in CET 1 capital in accordance with the Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (ECB/2015/4), and increased regulatory adjustments related to the expected loss shortfall of \u20ac 1.9 billion mainly due to new model implementations and deferred tax assets of \u20ac 1.0 billion partially offset by reductions in the  additional  value  adjustment  of  \u20ac 0.3 billion,  equity  compensation  of  \u20ac 0.2 billion  and  other  regulatory  adjustments  of \u20ac 0.1 billion. In addition, CET 1 capital decreased as a result of negative effects from currency translation adjustments net of capital deduction item counter-effects of \u20ac 0.8 billion and share buybacks of \u20ac 0.5 billion.\n\nThe AT1 capital decrease of \u20ac 0.2 billion was driven by increased capital deduction resulting from higher limits for market making transactions.\n\nThe Tier 2 capital decrease of \u20ac 0.9 billion was mainly due to the redemption of a Tier 2 instrument with a notional amount of \u20ac 1.3 billion, \u20ac 0.7 billion amortization, \u20ac 0.2 billion due to foreign exchange effects and \u20ac 0.2 billion higher deduction in market making limit.

        "page_content": "## Minimum loss coverage for Non Performing Exposure (NPE)\n\nIn April 2019, the EU published requirements Regulation (EU) 2019/630 amending the CRR (Regulation (EU) No 575/2013) for a prudential backstop reserve for non-performing exposure (NPE). This regulation results in a Pillar 1 deduction from CET 1 capital  when  a  minimum loss coverage requirement is not met.  It is applied to exposures originated and defaulted after April 25, 2019.\n\nIn  addition,  in  March  2018,  the  ECB  published  its  'Addendum  to  the  ECB  Guidance  to  banks  on  non-performing  loans: supervisory expectations for prudential provisioning of non-performing exposures' and in August 2019, its 'Communication on supervisory coverage expectations for NPEs'.\n\nThe ECB guidance issued is applicable to all newly defaulted loans after April 1, 2018 (ECB - new NPE's after April 1, 2018) and, similar to the EU rules, it requires banks to take measures in case a minimum impairment coverage requirement is not met. Within the annual SREP discussions ECB may impose Pillar 2 measures on banks in case ECB is not confident with measure taken by the individual bank.\n\nFor the year end 2020, the bank introduced a framework to determine the prudential provisioning of non-performing exposure as a Pillar 2 measure as requested in the before mentioned ECB's guidance and SREP recommendation.\n\nFor the minimum loss coverage expectation for NPE's arising from clients defaulted before April 1, 2018 (ECB - NPE Stock) a phase-in path to 100% coverage expectation was envisaged with an annual increase of 10%. In a first step, banks were allocated to three comparable groups on the basis of the bank's net NPL ratios as of end-2017 and in a second step an assessment of capacity regarding the potential impact was carried out for each individual bank with a horizon of end-2026. Deutsche Bank has been assigned to Group 1 which requires a full applicability of 100% minimum loss coverage by year end 2024 for secured loans respectively by year end 2023 for unsecured loans.\n\nThe shortfall between the minimum loss coverage requirements for non-performing exposure and the risk reserves recorded in line with the IFRS 9 for defaulted (Stage 3) assets amounted to \u20ac 322 million as of December 31, 2023 and was deducted from CET 1. This additional CET 1 charge can be considered as additional loss reserve and leads to a \u20ac 2.6 billion RWA relief. The reduction in the shortfall and the respective increase in the RWA relief in 2023 were driven by the benefits from data and process optimization as part of the bank's capital efficiency measures, as discussed below.\n\n## Non-performing exposure loss coverage\n\n|                                    | Dec 31, 2023    | Dec 31, 2023                         | Dec 31, 2023        | Dec 31, 2023                                  |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

Market risk RWA declined by \u20ac 4.6 billion, primarily driven by decreases in the Value-at-Risk and Stressed-Value-at-Risk components following a reduction in the qualitative and quantitative components of the capital multiplier. In addition, reductions in exposure led to a lower Value-at-Risk and Stressed-Value-at-Risk, which was partially offset by a higher Incremental Risk Charge, when compared to year end 2022. Credit risk RWA decreased by \u20ac 3.4 billion, primarily driven by benefits from data and process optimization  as  part  of  the  bank's  capital  efficiency  measures,  new  securitizations,  foreign  exchange  movements  and  a reduction in RWA for deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by an RWA increase due to regulatory changes from the introduction of new models, impacts from rating migration, exposures to central counterparties, increases from the acquisition of  Numis  and  business  growth.  Operational  risk  RWA  decreased  by  \u20ac 1.2 billion,  mainly  driven  by  a  more  favorable development of Deutsche Bank's internal loss profile feeding into the capital model. Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) RWA decreased  by  \u20ac 0.9 billion  mainly  driven  by  model  updates  and  market  data  changes,  partially  offset  by  changes  in methodology and policy as well as business activities.\n\nThe tables below provide an analysis of key drivers for risk-weighted asset movements observed for credit risk, credit valuation adjustments as well as market and operational risk in the reporting period. They also show the corresponding movements in capital requirements, derived from the RWA by an 8% minimum capital requirement.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for Credit Risk including Counterparty Credit Risk\n\n|                                            | Dec 31, 2023    | Dec 31, 2023          | Dec 31, 2022    | Dec 31, 2022          |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                    | Credit risk RWA | Capital  requirements | Credit risk RWA | Capital  requirements |\n| Credit risk RWA balance, beginning of year | 269,214         | 21,537                | 263,752         | 21,100                |\n| Book size                                  | (3,694)         | (296)                 | (6,254)         | (500)                 |\n| Book quality                               | (886)           | (71)                  | (478)           | (38)                  |\n| Model updates                              | 298             | 24                    | (179)           | (14)                  |\n| Methodology and policy                     | 5,831           | 466                   | 8,244           | 659                   |\n| Acquisition and disposals                  | 571             | 46                    | 0               | 0                     |\n| Foreign exchange movements                 | (4,174)         | (334)                 | 5,320           | 426                   |\n| Other                                      | (1,371)         | (110)                 | (1,191)         | (95)                  |\n| Credit risk RWA balance, end of year       | 265,789         | 21,263                | 269,214         | 21,537                |",

Organic changes in the Group's portfolio size and composition are considered in the category 'book size'. The category 'book quality' mainly represents the effects from portfolio rating migrations, loss given default, model parameter recalibrations as well as collateral and netting coverage activities. 'Model updates' include model refinements and advanced model roll out. RWA movements resulting from externally, regulatory-driven changes, e.g., applying new regulations, are considered in the 'methodology and policy' section. 'Acquisition and disposals' is reserved to show significant exposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new businesses or disposal-related activities. Changes that cannot be attributed to the above categories are reflected in the category 'other'.\n\nThe decrease in RWA for credit risk by \u20ac 3.4 billion, or 1.3%, since December 31, 2022, is mainly driven by the categories 'foreign exchange movements', 'book size', 'other' and 'book quality'. This was partially offset by changes shown in the categories 'methodology and policy', 'acquisition and disposals' and 'model updates'. The decrease in category 'book size' is  predominantly driven by a relief from synthetic securitizations in the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank, which was partially offset by business growth. Additionally, the decrease in category 'other' reflects a reduction in RWA for deferred tax assets and investments in financial sector entities. The reduction in 'book quality' is mainly driven by benefits from data and process optimization as part of the bank's capital efficiency measures, partially offset by counterparty rating deteriorations. The aforementioned decreases were partially offset by increases in the category 'methodology and policy' which mainly reflects impacts from the introduction of new models due to regulatory changes and exposures to central counterparties. The category 'acquisition and disposals' reflects the acquisition of Numis. Furthermore, credit risk RWA increased in the category 'model updates' compared to 2022, driven by refinements on Deutsche Bank's IRBA model.\n\nRWA for counterparty credit risk decreased by \u20ac 3.7 billion, or 15.8%, since December 31, 2022, mainly driven by the decrease in category 'book size' reflecting lower exposures for derivatives along with lower risk weights for new positions as well as a reduction in the category 'foreign exchange movements'. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in category 'book quality', particularly stemming from counterparty rating deteriorations. Additionally, RWA for counterparty credit risk increased in the category 'methodology and policy', driven by impacts from the introduction of new models due to regulatory changes and exposures to central counterparties.\n\nBased on the CRR/CRD regulatory framework, Deutsche Bank is required to calculate RWA using the CVA which takes into account the credit quality of our counterparties. RWA for CVA covers the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk in connection with OTC derivative exposures and securities financing transactions. Deutsche Bank calculates the majority of the CVA based on our own internal model as approved by the BaFin.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for Credit Valuation Adjustment\n\n|                                        | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023          | Dec 31, 2022   | Dec 31, 2022          |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                | CVA RWA        | Capital  requirements | CVA RWA        | Capital  requirements |\n| CVA RWA balance, beginning of year     | 6,184          | 495                   | 6,327          | 506                   |\n| Movement in risk levels                | 170            | 14                    | 1,217          | 97                    |\n| Market data changes and recalibrations | (656)          | (52)                  | (200)          | (16)                  |\n| Model updates                          | (683)          | (55)                  | (1,160)        | (93)                  |\n| Methodology and policy                 | 261            | 21                    | 0              | 0                     |\n| Acquisitions and disposals             | 0              | 0                     | 0              | 0                     |\n| Foreign exchange movements             | 0              | 0                     | 0              | 0                     |\n| CVA RWA balance, end of year           | 5,276          | 422                   | 6,184          | 495                   |\n\nThe development of CVA RWA is broken down into a number of categories: 'Movement in risk levels', which includes changes to the portfolio size and composition; 'Market data changes and calibrations', which includes changes in market data levels and volatilities as well as recalibrations; 'Model updates', which refers to changes to either the IMM credit exposure models or the value-at-risk models that are used for CVA RWA; 'Methodology and policy', which relates to changes to the regulation.

MRSA  is  used  to  determine  the  regulatory  capital  charge  for  the  specific  market  risk  of  trading  book securitizations, for certain types of investment funds and for longevity risk as set out in CRR/CRD regulations.\n\nMarket risk RWA movements due to changes in market data levels, volatilities, correlations, liquidity and ratings are included under  the  'Market  data  changes  and  recalibrations'  category.  Changes  to  market  risk  RWA  internal  models,  such  as methodology enhancements or risk scope extensions, are included in the category 'Model updates'. In the 'Methodology and policy'  category  regulatory  driven  changes  to  market  risk  RWA  models  and  calculations  are  reported.  Significant  new businesses and disposals would be assigned to the line item 'Acquisition and disposals'. The impacts of 'Foreign exchange movements' are only calculated for the CRM and Standardized approach methods.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the RWA for market risk was \u20ac 21.5 billion, a decrease of \u20ac 4.6 billion, or -18% since December 31, 2022. The decrease is driven by the 'Methodology and policy' category due to a reduction in quantitative component of capital multiplier by 0.85 on the back of backtesting outliers moving out of the 250 day window and reduction in qualitative component of multiplier by 0.5. The Incremental Risk Charge increased by \u20ac 3.5 billion driven by changes in sovereign bond inventory for facilitating market making in Global Rates and Global Emerging Markets business which is offset by lower value at risk and stressed value at risk driven by a reduction in interest rates exposure under Global Rates and reductions following the changes in Global Foreign Exchange business strategy.\n\n## Development of risk-weighted assets for operational risk\n\n|                                                 | Dec 31, 2023          | Dec 31, 2023          | Dec 31, 2022          | Dec 31, 2022          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                         | Operational risk  RWA | Capital  requirements | Operational risk  RWA | Capital  requirements |\n| Operational risk RWA balance, beginning of year | 58,349                | 4,668                 | 61,718                | 4,937                 |\n| Loss profile changes (internal and external)    | (1,577)               | (126)                 | (3,405)               | (272)                 |\n| Expected loss development                       | 150                   | 12                    | (166)                 | (13)                  |\n| Forward looking risk component                  | 130                   | 10                    | 794                   | 63                    |\n| Model updates                                   | 0                     | 0                     | (669)                 | (54)                  |\n| Methodology and policy                          | 100                   | 8                     | 78                    | 6                     |\n| Acquisitions and disposals                      | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     | 0                     |\n| Operational risk RWA balance, end of year       | 57,153                | 4,572                 | 58,349                | 4,668                 |",

The decline was due to an increase in economic capital demand, which is explained in the section 'Risk Profile', and a decrease in economic capital supply.\n\nThe decrease in economic capital supply by \u20ac 2.4 billion compared to year-end 2022 was mainly driven by higher capital deduction from expected loss shortfall of \u20ac 1.9 billion, introduction of a new deduction of \u20ac 1.5 billion for valuation differences between carrying and fair values for debt securities held to collect, deductions for future common share dividend and AT1 coupon payments of \u20ac 1.3 billion, currency translation adjustments of \u20ac 1.1 billion, higher capital deductions for IFRS deferred tax assets excluding temporary differences of \u20ac 0.8 billion and cash flow hedges of \u20ac 0.8 billion. These decreases were partly offset by a positive net income of \u20ac 4.8 billion and reduced deduction for additional valuation adjustments of \u20ac 0.3 billion.",

        "page_content": "## Leverage Ratio\n\n## Leverage Ratio according to CRR/CRD framework\n\nThe non-risk-based leverage ratio is intended to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements. Its objectives are to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilizing deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy, and to reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk based 'backstop' measure.\n\nA minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3% was introduced effective starting with June 28, 2021. Starting January 1, 2023, an additional leverage ratio buffer requirement of 50% of the applicable G-SII buffer rate applies. This additional requirement equals 0.75% for Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has set a Pillar 2 requirement for the leverage ratio for the first time; effective January 1, 2024, this requirement will be 0.10%.\n\nDeutsche Bank calculates its leverage ratio exposure in accordance with Articles 429 to 429g of the CRR.\n\nThe Group's total leverage ratio exposure includes derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), off-balance sheet exposure and other on-balance sheet exposure (excluding derivatives and SFTs).\n\nThe leverage exposure for derivatives is calculated by using a modified version of the standardized approach for counterparty credit  risk  (SA-CCR),  comprising  the  current  replacement  cost  plus  a  regulatory  defined  add-on  for  the  potential  future exposure. The effective notional amount of written credit derivatives, i.e., the notional reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital is included  in  the  leverage  ratio  exposure  measure;  the  resulting exposure measure is further reduced by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivative protection on the same reference name provided certain conditions are met.\n\nThe SFT component includes the gross receivables for SFTs, which are netted with SFT payables if specific conditions are met. In addition to the gross exposure a regulatory add-on for the counterparty credit risk is included.\n\nThe off-balance sheet exposure component follows the standardized approach for credit risk with credit risk conversion factors (CCF) depending on the risk category (0% for low risk, 20% for medium/low risk, 50% for medium risk, or 100% for full risk). For the determination of the leverage exposure a floor of 10% is applied leading to a 10% CCF for the low risk category.\n\nThe on-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs) component reflects the accounting values of the assets (excluding derivatives, SFTs and regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement). The exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement is determined as offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where the related regular-way sales and purchases are both settled on a delivery-versus payment basis.\n\nAssets can be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure if they have been deducted in the determination of Tier 1 capital. The corresponding regulatory adjustments are reflected in the asset amounts deducted in determining Tier 1 capital component.\n\nThe following tables show the leverage ratio exposure and the leverage ratio. For further details on Tier 1 capital please also refer to the section 'Development of Own Funds'.\n\n## Summary reconciliation of accounting assets and leverage ratio exposures\n\n| in \u20ac bn.                                                                                                                      | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Total assets as per published financial statements                                                                            | 1,312          | 1,337          |\n| Adjustment for entities which are consolidated for accounting purposes but are outside the scope of  regulatory consolidation | 2              | 2              |\n| Adjustments for derivative financial instruments                                                                              | (122)          | (171)          |\n| Adjustment for securities financing transactions (SFTs)                                                                       | 4              | 1              |\n| Adjustment for off-balance sheet items (i.e. conversion to credit equivalent amounts of off-balance  sheet exposures)         | 127            | 128            |\n| Other adjustments                                                                                                             | (83)           | (57)           |\n| Leverage ratio total exposure measure                                                                                         | 1,240          | 1,240          |",

This takes into account a  Tier 1  capital  of  \u20ac 56.4 billion  over  an  applicable  exposure  measure  of  \u20ac 1,240.3 billion  as  of  December 31,  2023 (\u20ac 56.6 billion over an applicable exposure measure of \u20ac 1,240.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively).\n\nOver  the  year  2023  the  leverage  exposure  was  materially  unchanged  at  \u20ac 1,240.3 billion.  Asset  amounts  deducted  in determining Tier 1 capital declined by \u20ac 2.8 billion mainly reflecting higher capital deductions for negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts and deferred tax assets. In addition, off-balance sheet leverage exposure decreased by \u20ac 0.6 billion. The leverage exposure for assets not related to derivatives and secured financing transactions decreased by \u20ac 0.5 billion which largely reflects the development of the balance sheet (for additional information please refer to  section  'Movements  in  assets  and  liabilities'  in  this  report).  SFT-related  items  (securities  purchased  under  resale agreements and securities borrowed) increased by \u20ac 3.0 billion, largely in line with the development on the balance sheet. Furthermore, the leverage exposure related to derivatives increased by \u20ac 0.8 billion.\n\nThe development of the leverage exposure in 2023 includes a negative foreign exchange impact of \u20ac 17.7 billion mainly due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro. The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are embedded in the movement of the leverage exposure items discussed in this section.\n\nFor main drivers of the Tier 1 capital development please refer to section 'Development of Own Funds'.\n\n## Minimum Requirement of Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity\n\n## MREL Requirements\n\nThe minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) was introduced by the European Union's Regulation establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions (Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation or SRMR) and the European Union's Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD) as implemented into German law by the German Recovery and Resolution Act.\n\nThe  currently  required  level  of  MREL  is  determined  by  the  competent  resolution  authorities  for  each  supervised  bank individually, depending on the respective preferred resolution strategy. In the case of Deutsche Bank AG, MREL is determined by the Single Resolution Board. While there is no statutory minimum level of MREL, the SRMR, BRRD and a delegated regulation set out criteria which the resolution authority must consider when determining the relevant required level of MREL. Guidance is provided through an MREL policy published annually by the SRB. Any binding MREL ratio determined by the SRB is communicated to Deutsche Bank via the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nAs a result of its regular annual review the SRB has updated Deutsche Bank AG's binding MREL ratio requirements in the second quarter of 2023 applicable immediately. The MREL ratio requirement on a consolidated basis is now 25.21% of RWA and 6.92% of LRE of which 19.54% of RWA and 6.92% of LRE must be met with own funds and subordinated instruments.\n\nThe combined buffer requirements of 5.14% as of December 31, 2023 must be met in addition to the RWA based MREL and subordinated MREL requirements.",

        "page_content": "## TLAC Requirements\n\nSince June 27, 2019, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, has also become subject to global minimum standards for its Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The TLAC requirement was implemented via amendments to the Capital  Requirements  Regulation  and  the  Capital  Requirements  Directive  provided  in  June  2019  with  the  publication  of Regulation (EU) 2019/876 and Directive (EU) 2019/878.\n\nThis TLAC requirement is based on both risk-based and non-risk-based denominators and set at the higher-of 18% of RWA plus the combined buffer requirements and 6.75% of LRE since January 1, 2022.\n\n## MREL ratio development\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, available MREL were \u20ac 123.3 billion, corresponding to a ratio of 35.24% of RWA. This means that Deutsche Bank has a comfortable MREL surplus of \u20ac 17.1 billion above Deutsche Bank's MREL requirement of \u20ac 106.2 billion (i.e. 30.35% of RWA including combined buffer requirement). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has reduced as a higher MREL requirement was not fully offset by lower RWA.\n\n\u20ac 114.1 billion of Deutsche Bank's available MREL were own funds and subordinated liabilities, corresponding to a MREL subordination  ratio  of  32.63%  of  RWA,  a  buffer  of  \u20ac 27.8 billion  over  Deutsche  Bank's  subordination  requirement  of \u20ac 86.3 billion (i.e. 24.68% of RWA including combined buffer requirements). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has increased due to a lower subordinated MREL requirement and lower RWA.\n\n## TLAC ratio development\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, TLAC was \u20ac 114.1 billion and the corresponding TLAC ratios were 32.63% of RWA and 9.20% of LRE.  This  means  that  Deutsche  Bank  has  a  comfortable  TLAC  surplus  of  \u20ac 30.4 billion  over  its  TLAC  requirement  of \u20ac 83.7 billion (6.75% of LRE). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has reduced due to a lower available TLAC.",

        "page_content": "## Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities\n\nTo meet the MREL and TLAC requirement, Deutsche Bank needs to ensure that enough eligible liabilities instruments are maintained. Instruments eligible for MREL and TLAC are regulatory capital instruments (own funds) and liabilities that meet certain criteria, which are referred to as eligible liabilities.\n\nOwn funds used for MREL and TLAC include the full amount of Tier 2 capital instruments with a remaining maturity of greater than 1 year and less than 5 years which are reflected in regulatory capital on a pro-rata basis only.\n\nEligible liabilities are liabilities issued out of the resolution entity Deutsche Bank AG that meet eligibility criteria which are supposed to ensure that they are structurally suited as loss-absorbing capital. As a result, eligible liabilities exclude deposits which are covered by an insurance deposit protection scheme or which are preferred under German insolvency law (e.g., deposits from private individuals as well as small and medium-sized enterprises). Among other things, secured liabilities and derivatives liabilities are generally excluded as well. Debt instruments with embedded derivative features can be included under certain conditions (e.g., a known and fixed or increasing principal). In addition, eligible liabilities must have a remaining time to maturity of at least one year and must either be issued under the law of a Member State of the European Union or must include a bail-in clause in their contractual terms to make write-down or conversion effective. The SRB has granted a transitional period for liabilities issued under UK law on or before November 15, 2018, which do not include an enforceable and effective bail-in clause but can still be included in eligible liabilities after Brexit until June 28, 2025.\n\nIn addition, eligible liabilities need to be subordinated to be counted against the TLAC and MREL subordination requirements. Effective January 1, 2017, the German Banking Act provided for a new class of statutorily subordinated debt securities that rank as senior non-preferred below the bank's other senior liabilities (but in priority to the bank's contractually subordinated liabilities, such as those qualifying as Tier 2 instruments). Following a harmonization effort by the European Union implemented in Germany effective July 21, 2018, banks are permitted to now decide if a specific issuance of eligible senior debt will be in the non-preferred or in the preferred category. Any such senior non-preferred debt instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG under such rules rank on parity with its outstanding debt instruments that were classified as senior non-preferred under the prior rules. All these senior non-preferred issuances meet the TLAC and MREL subordination criteria.",

Haircuts, parameter setting  for  regular  margin  calls  as  well  as  expert  judgments  for  collateral  valuation  are  employed  to  prevent  market developments from leading to a build-up of uncollateralized exposures. All categories are monitored and reviewed regularly. Overall credit enhancements received are diversified and of adequate quality being largely cash, highly rated government bonds and third-party guarantees mostly from well rated banks and insurance companies. These financial institutions are domiciled mainly in European countries and the United States. Furthermore, the Bank has collateral pools of highly liquid assets and mortgages (principally consisting of residential properties mainly in Germany) for the homogeneous retail portfolio.",

High emphasis is placed on structuring and pricing such transactions so that derisking can be achieved in a timely manner and - where Deutsche Bank takes market price risk - to mitigate such market risk.\n\nThe Group's amortized cost loan exposure within above categories is mostly to good quality borrowers. Moreover, with the focus on the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, loan exposure is subject to further risk mitigation through the bank's e.g., Strategic Corporate Lending unit.\n\nDeutsche Bank's household loan exposure is principally associated with Private Bank portfolios.",

        "page_content": "The bank's amortized cost loan exposure of \u20ac 49.3 billion to Real Estate activities as reported above is based on NACE code classification and comprises of recourse and non-recourse financing, across various parts of the group and client segment. This  includes  25.1 billion  of  loans  which  is  based  on  Deutsch  Bank's  definition  of  non-recourse  CRE  loans.  For  more information on non-recourse CRE loans, see section Focus areas in 2023 in the chapter IFRS 9 Impairment.\n\nThe  Group's  commercial  real  estate  loans,  primarily  originated  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  are  generally  secured  by  first mortgages on the underlying real estate property. Deutsche Bank originates fixed and floating rate loans and selectively acquires (generally at substantial discount) sub- /non-performing loans sold by financial institutions. The underwriting process is stringent and the exposure is managed under separate portfolio limits. Credit underwriting policy guidelines provide that LTV ratios of generally less than 75% are adhered to at loan origination. Additionally, given the significance of the underlying collateral, independent external appraisals are commissioned for all secured loans by a valuation team (part of the independent Credit Risk Management function) which is also responsible for reviewing and challenging the reported real estate values regularly. Deutsche Bank originates loans for distribution in the banking market or via securitization. In this context Deutsche Bank frequently retains a portion of the syndicated loans while securitized positions may be entirely sold (except where regulation requires retention of economic risk). Mezzanine or other junior tranches of debt are retained only in exceptional cases.  The  bank  also  participates  in  conservatively  underwritten  unsecured  lines  of  credit  to  well-capitalized  real  estate investment trusts and other real estate operating companies.\n\nCommercial real estate property valuations and rental incomes can be significantly impacted by macro-economic conditions and idiosyncratic events affecting the underlying properties. Accordingly, the portfolio is categorized as higher risk and hence subject to the aforementioned tight restrictions on concentration.\n\nThe Group's credit exposure to ten largest counterparties accounted for 12% of the bank's aggregated total credit exposure in  these  categories  as  of  December 31,  2023,  compared  with  11%  as  of  December 31,  2022.  The  top  ten  counterparty exposures were well-rated counterparties or otherwise related to structured trades which show high levels of risk mitigation.\n\nDeutsche Bank's exposure to Financial and Insurance Activities is \u20ac 381.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 which also includes exposures to Asset Backed Securities, Banks, Insurance, Financial intermediaries, Public Sector as well as to Corporates including  Holding  Companies.  Exposures  are  managed  using  bespoke  risk  management  frameworks,  trade-by-trade approvals  and  relevant  risk  appetite  metrics.  Total  loans  across  all  applicable  measurement  categories  amounted  to \u20ac 116.3 billion, total repo and repo style transactions across all applicable measurement categories amounted to \u20ac 93.3 billion and off-balance sheet activities amounted to \u20ac 118.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and were principally associated with Investment Bank and Corporate Bank portfolios, which were majorly held in North America and Europe.",

        "page_content": "The above tables show an overall increase in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank gross exposure in 2023 of \u20ac 29.1 billion or 4%. Debt Securities at fair value through profit and loss increased by \u20ac 31.8 billion mainly due to increase in long bond inventory  position  in  Government  securities  in  Core  rates  business.  Off-balance  sheet  positions  increased  by\u20ac 6.1 billion mainly driven by new commitments issued during the period. Repo and repo-style transactions increased by \u20ac 3.5 billion in Investment Bank. From a regional perspective, the increase was primarily attributable to counterparties  domiciled  in  the Cayman Island, Italy, China and Germany. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in Loans at amortized cost of \u20ac 7.2 billion primarily in Corporate Bank and decrease in OTC Derivatives of \u20ac 5.4 billion due to reduction in Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative products.\n\nThe above table also shows a material shift in internal credit ratings, primarily from Non-Investment Grade to Investment Grade.  This  is  attributable  to  a  regulatory-driven  recalibration  of  the  Global  Corporates  and  Leveraged  Finance  related scorecards to better reflect observed default histories.\n\nThe Group uses risk mitigation  techniques  as  described  above  to  optimize  Corporate  Bank  and  Investment  Bank  credit exposures and reduce potential credit losses. The tables for 'net' exposure disclose the development of the bank's Corporate Bank and Investment Bank credit exposures net of collateral, guarantees and hedges.\n\n## Risk Mitigation for Credit Exposure\n\nStrategic Corporate Lending ('SCL') unit helps to mitigate the risk of the bank's corporate credit exposures. The notional amount  of  SCL's  risk  reduction  activities  increased  from  \u20ac 33.9 billion  as  of  December 31,  2022,  to  \u20ac 37.7 billion  as  of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of year-end 2023, SCL mitigated the credit risk of \u20ac 32.0 billion of loans and lending-related commitments, through synthetic collateralized  loan  obligations  supported  predominantly  by  financial  guarantees.  This  position  totaled  \u20ac 27.5 billion  as  of December 31, 2022.\n\nSCL also held credit derivatives with an underlying notional amount of \u20ac 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The position totaled \u20ac 6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The credit derivatives used for the bank's portfolio management activities are accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe bank makes use of hedging also in other businesses to reduce single name concentration risks and utilizes private risk insurance and export credit agency cover to manage noncollateralized exposures.\n\n## Private Bank credit exposure\n\n## Private Bank credit exposure,

Consumer Finance business is uncollateralized, loan risk depends on client quality. Various lending requirements are stipulated, including (but not limited to) client rating, maximum loan amounts and maximum tenors, and are adapted to regional conditions and/or circumstances of the borrower (i.e., for consumer loans a maximum loan amount taking into account customer net income). Given the largely homogeneous nature of this portfolio, counterparty credit-worthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine.",

        "page_content": "Mortgage business is the financing of residential properties (primarily owner-occupied) sold by various business channels in Europe, primarily in Germany but also in Spain and Italy. The level of credit risk of the mortgage loan portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the client and the underlying collateral. The loan amounts are generally larger than Consumer Finance loans and they are extended for longer time horizons. Based on the bank's underwriting criteria and processes and the diversified portfolio (customers/properties) with respective collateralization, the mortgage portfolio is categorized as lower risk, while consumer finance is categorized as high risk.\n\nBusiness Finance represents credit products for small businesses, SME up to large corporates. Products range from current accounts and credit lines to investment loans or revolving facilities, factoring, leasing and derivatives. Clients are located primarily in Italy and Spain, but credit can also be extended to subsidiaries abroad, mostly in Europe.\n\nWealth Management offers customized wealth management solutions and private banking services including discretionary portfolio management and traditional and alternative investment solutions, complemented by structured risk management, wealth  planning,  lending  and  family  office  services  for  wealth,  high-net-worth  (HNW)  and  ultra-high-net-worth  (UHNW) individuals  and  family  offices.  Wealth  Management's  total  exposure  is  divided  into  Lombard  Lending  (against  readily marketable liquid collateral / securities) and Structured Lending (against less liquid collateral). While the level of credit risk for the Lombard portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the underlying collateral, the level of credit risk for the structured portfolio is determined by assessing both the quality of the client and the collateral. Products range from secured Lombard and  mortgage  loans  to  current  accounts  (Europe  only),  credit  lines  and  other  loans;  to  a  lesser  extent  derivatives  and contingencies.

These values are monitored and updated if necessary, on a regular basis. The exposure of transactions that are additionally backed by liquid collateral is reduced by the respective collateral values, whereas any prior charges increase the corresponding total exposure. The LTV calculation includes exposure which is secured by real estate collateral. Any mortgage lending exposure that is collateralized exclusively by any other type of collateral is not included in the LTV calculation.\n\nThe creditor's creditworthiness, the LTV and the quality of collateral is an integral part of the Group's risk management when originating loans and when monitoring and steering the Group's credit risks. In general, the Group is willing to accept higher LTV's, the better the creditor's creditworthiness is. Nevertheless, restrictions of LTV apply e.g. for countries with negative economic outlook or expected declines of real estate values.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, 65% of the Group's exposure related to the mortgage lending portfolio had an LTV ratio below or equal to 50% compared to 63% as on December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Exposure from Derivatives\n\nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties ('CCPs'), the rules and regulations of which provide for daily margining of all current and future credit risk positions emerging out of such transactions. To the extent possible, the bank also uses CCP services for OTC derivative transactions ('OTC clearing'); thereby the bank benefits from the credit risk mitigation achieved through the CCP's settlement system.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, platform trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives, as well as rules regarding registration, capital, margin, business conduct standards, recordkeeping and other requirements for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants. The Dodd-Frank Act and related CFTC rules require OTC clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps. Margin requirements for non-cleared derivative transactions in the U.S. started in September 2016. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories ('EMIR') introduced a number of risk mitigation techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives in 2013 and the reporting of OTC and exchange traded derivatives in 2014. Mandatory clearing of certain standardized OTC derivatives transactions in the EU began in June 2016, and margin requirements for un-cleared OTC derivative transactions in the EU started in February 2017. Deutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin in the EU from February 2017 for the first category of counterparties subject to the EMIR margin for un-cleared derivatives requirements.\n\nThe CFTC has adopted rules implementing the most significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. More recently, in September 2020, the CFTC issued a final rule on the cross-border application of U.S. swap rules, which builds on, and in some cases supersedes the CFTC's cross-border guidance from 2013 and related no-action relief letters. In October 2020, also pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC finalized regulations to impose position limits on certain commodities and economically equivalent swaps, futures and options.\n\nThe SEC has also finalized rules regarding registration, trade reporting, capital, margin, risk mitigation techniques, business conduct  standards,  trade  acknowledgement  and  verification,  recordkeeping  and  financial  reporting,  and  cross-border requirements  for  security-based  swap  dealers  and  major  security-based  swap  participants.  Compliance  with  these requirements was generally required as of November 2021.\n\nFinally, U.S. prudential regulators (the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Farm Credit Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) have adopted final rules establishing margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps that are applicable to swap dealers and security-based swap dealers that are subject to U.S. prudential regulations (such as Deutsche Bank) in lieu of the CFTC's and the SEC's margin rules. Deutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin for uncleared derivatives in the U.S. from September 2016, for the first category of counterparties subject to the U.S. prudential regulators' margin requirements. Additional initial margin requirements for smaller counterparties have been phased in from September 2017 through September 2022, with the relevant compliance dates depending in each case on the transactional volume of the parties and their affiliates.\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of notional amounts and gross market values for assets and liabilities of exchange traded and OTC derivative transactions on the basis of clearing channel.",

The change was driven by increase in sovereign bond inventory for facilitating market making under Global Rates and Global Emerging Markets business.\n\n## Results of Regulatory Backtesting of Trading Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Group observed one outlier where the Group's loss on a buy-and-hold and actual basis exceeded the value-atrisk of the Trading books. This was driven by an increase in market volatility following the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in the first quarter of 2023. The market volatility led to moves in interest rates that were larger than those within the preceding one-year period used in the value-at-risk calculation.\n\nThe following graph shows the trading units daily buy-and-hold and Actual income in comparison to the value-at-risk as of the close of the previous business day for the trading days of the reporting period. The value-at-risk is presented in negative amounts to visually compare the estimated potential loss of the trading positions with the buy and hold income given buy-andhold is the relevant portion of daily profit and loss for comparison against the previous day's value at risk which excludes new trades, reserves, and any carry profit and loss ordinarily part of actual income. Figures are shown in millions of euro. The chart shows that the trading units achieved a positive buy and hold income for 54% of the trading days in 2023 as well as displays the global outlier experienced in 2023.\n\n## EU MR4 - Comparison of VAR estimates with gains/losses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActual income of Trading units\n\nValue-at-Risk",

This was primarily driven by a gain of \u20ac 333 million related to the event type 'Internal Fraud', which reflects a release of litigation provisions. Losses under Clients, Products and Business Practices' increased year on year due to increased provisions from civil litigation.

The event type 'Clients, Products and Business Practices' forms the most significant portion of operational losses with a share of \u20ac 605 million largely made up of settled matters and changes in litigation reserves for unsettled matters. The event type 'External Fraud' saw a substantial year on year increase, driven by two material litigation cases. The event type 'Execution, Delivery and Process Management' also significantly increased, primarily due to non-litigation losses. The reduction of losses in event type 'Internal Fraud' is driven by a release of litigation provisions.\n\nThe diagram 'Frequency of Operational Losses' summarizes the operational risk events by event type (based on a count of events where losses were first recognized in 2023), related to the average for the comparative five-year period 2018-2022 (in brackets). 'External Fraud' remains the highest frequency event type although there has been a notable reduction versus the five year average.\n\nWhilst the bank seeks to ensure the comprehensive capture of all operational risk loss events with a net operational risk loss impact of \u20ac 10,000 or greater, the totals shown in this section may be underestimated due to delayed detection and recording of loss events.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\n## Funding Markets and Capital Markets Issuance\n\nMultiple macro topics emerged during 2023 and weighed on markets, following a normalization after geopolitical events in the past  years.  Particularly  impactful  were  the  high  inflation  countered  by  unprecedented  rate  hikes,  continued  geopolitical uncertainties, the default of some regional US banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Notwithstanding this backdrop, the Bank navigated markets well and successfully concluded its issuance activity at 17.2 billion euros. After deducting the 1.5 billion USD senior-non preferred note issued in November as pre-funding, the overall volume was within the plan of 1318 billion euros which was narrowed to a guidance of 14 to 16 billion euros during Q4.\n\nLooking at the whole year, credit markets showed a constructive performance despite the multiple disruptions with broader indices trading tighter versus year end 2022. The bank's senior non-preferred cash bonds widened on account of the market turmoil in March relating to regional U.S. banks and Credit Suisse and underperformed peers until April 2023. Thereafter DB's spreads tightened and outperformed peers. The positive development of DB's spreads was supported by three rating upgrades from DBRS, Fitch and S&P throughout the year. As of year end 2023, DB's spreads are tighter than at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe total issuance volume of \u20ac 17.2 billion is split as follows: \u20ac 1.4 billion in capital issuances, \u20ac 6.7 billion of senior nonpreferred  funding,  \u20ac 6.0 billion  in  senior  preferred.  The  Group  also  issued  \u20ac 2.6 billion  Pfandbriefe  and  \u20ac 0.5 billion C\u00e9dulas. From a currency perspective, the total issuance volume is divided as follows: Euros (\u20ac 8.5 billion),  U.S.  dollars (\u20ac 6.9 billion), Pounds Sterling (\u20ac 0.8 billion) and other currencies aggregated (\u20ac 1.0 billion). The Group's investor base for 2023 issuances was as follows: asset managers and pension funds (34%), retail customers (17%), banks (16%), insurance companies (8%), Corporates (1%), Governments and agencies (4%) and other institutional investors (20%). The geographical distribution was split between Germany (41%), rest of Europe (24%), U.S. (26%), Asia/Pacific (8%) and Other (1%). The average spread of issuance over 3-months-Euribor/RFR (Risk Free Rate) was 164bp for the full year. The average tenor was 5.1 years. The Group issued the following volumes over each quarter: Q1: \u20ac 7.5 billion, Q2: \u20ac 2.0 billion, Q3: \u20ac 3.1 billion and Q4: \u20ac 4.7 billion.\n\nDeutsche Bank's issuance plan for 2024 is \u20ac 13-18 billion and similar to 2023. It comprises capital instruments, senior nonpreferred, senior preferred and covered bonds. The Group also plans to raise a portion of this funding in U.S. dollar and may enter into cross currency swaps to manage any residual requirements. The Bank has total capital markets maturities, excluding legally exercisable calls, of approximately \u20ac 11 billion. Furthermore, the Bank issued structured notes with a volume of EUR 5.3bn in 2013 and plans to issue \u20ac 6-7 billion in 2024. This activity is conducted by the FIC division and not part of the Treasury issuance plan.\n\n## Funding Diversification\n\nIn  2023, total external funding increased by \u20ac 14.6 billion from \u20ac 955.7 billion at December 31, 2022, to \u20ac 970.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Funding from the Corporate Bank has increased by \u20ac 1.5 billion, whereas deposits in the Private Bank have  decreased  by  \u20ac 9.6 billion.  For  both  divisions,  there  has  been  a  shift  from  sight  to  term  deposits.  The  unsecured Wholesale  Funding  portfolio  increased  by  \u20ac 11.4 billion,  thereof  \u20ac 2.5 billion  from  Investment  Bank  deposits.  In  addition, Capital Markets and Equity increased by \u20ac 8.5 billion driven by an increase of \u20ac 2.5 billion in Equity and \u20ac 6.0 billion in longterm Debt Issuances. Secured funding and shorts have been overall stable compared to December 31, 2022, with reductions from the repayment of TLTRO (Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations) of \u20ac 18.7 billion as well as a decrease of \u20ac 6.6 billion in trading liabilities has been offset by an increase of \u20ac 23.9 billion in repurchase operations.",

This is primarily due to the repayment of TLTRO liabilities offset by business portfolio movements. The Group maintains additional highly liquid central bank eligible assets, not qualifying as HQLA or subject to transfer restrictions under the HQLA definition. These additional liquid assets were \u20ac 42 billion, such that the Group's total Liquidity Reserves were \u20ac 261 billion as at the end of December 31, 2023. As at the end of December 31, 2022, these additional liquid assets were \u20ac 37 billion, such that the Group's total Liquidity Reserves were \u20ac 256 billion. The 12 month average HQLA in 2023 was \u20ac 215 billion as compared with \u20ac 218 billion during 2022.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 140% at the end fourth quarter of 2023, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 62 billion as compared to 142% as at the end of fourth quarter of 2022, a surplus to regulatory requirements of \u20ac 64 billion.

        "page_content": "## Asset Encumbrance\n\nThis section refers to asset encumbrance in the group of institutions consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to the German Banking Act. Therefore, this excludes insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector. Assets pledged by our insurance subsidiaries are included in Note 20 'Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral' of the consolidated financial statements, and restricted assets held to satisfy obligations to insurance companies' policy holders are included within Note 37 'Information on Subsidiaries' of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Additionally, in line with EBA technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets placed with settlement systems, including default funds and initial margins, as well as other assets pledged which cannot be freely withdrawn such as mandatory minimum reserves at central banks, are considered encumbered. We also include derivative margin receivable assets as encumbered under these EBA guidelines.\n\nReadily available assets are those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are not otherwise encumbered, and which are in freely transferrable form. Unencumbered financial assets at fair value, other than securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and positive market value from derivatives, and available for sale investments are all assumed to be readily available.\n\nThe readily available value represents the on- and off-balance sheet carrying amount or fair value rather than any form of stressed liquidity value (see the 'High Quality Liquid Assets' for an analysis of unencumbered liquid assets available under a liquidity stress scenario). Other unencumbered on- and off-balance sheet assets are those assets that have not been pledged as collateral against secured funding or other collateralized obligations or are otherwise not considered to be readily available. Included in this category are securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and positive market value from derivatives. Similarly, for loans and other advances to customers, these would only be viewed as readily available to the extent they are already in a pre-packaged transferrable format and have not already been used to generate funding.

Modeling of assets and liabilities is necessary in cases where the contractual maturity does not adequately reflect the liquidity risk position. The most significant example in this context would be immediately repayable deposits from retail and transaction banking customers which have consistently displayed high stability throughout even the most severe financial crises.\n\nThe modeling profiles are part of the overall liquidity risk management framework (see section 'Liquidity Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis' for short-term liquidity positions \u2264 1 year and section 'Structural Funding' for long-term liquidity positions > 1 year) which is defined and approved by the Management Board.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nSustainability, which encompasses ESG dimensions, has been a key element of Deutsche Bank's strategy since 2019 and one of the three thematic pillars that underpin Deutsche Bank's corporate strategy - along with macro-economic shifts and technology. In 2023, the bank continued to focus on four pillars of its sustainability strategy: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own Operations as well as Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement. Making progress along these  four  pillars  is  aimed  at  enabling  the  bank  to  maximize  its  contribution  to  the  achievement  of  the  Paris  Climate Agreement's  targets  and  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Deutsche  Bank  endorsed  multiple universal  sustainability  frameworks  and  initiatives.  The  bank  is  a  member  of  the  UN's  Environment  Programme  Finance Initiative (1992) and signatory to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (2000), the Principles for Responsible Investment (through DWS, 2008), the Principles for Responsible Banking (2019) and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (2021).\n\nThe bank further integrated the oversight of sustainability-related issues into governance structures on several levels, ranging from the Supervisory Board and the Group Sustainability Committee to senior business leadership, key infrastructure and control functions as well as specialist teams. The bank's sustainability governance includes two key committees and one council devoted entirely to sustainability.\n\nThe Group Sustainability Committee acts as the main governance and decision-making body for sustainability related matters across the Deutsche Bank Group. The committee is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer (Vice Chair). Its 'run the bank'-mandate has oversight of sustainability strategy implementation across divisions and ensures alignment of the sustainability strategy with the bank's corporate strategy. The Sustainability Strategy Steering Committee oversees the implementation of Deutsche Bank's sustainability strategy as one of the bank's 'Key Deliverables' ('change the bank' priorities).  The  Sustainability  Council  fosters  knowledge  exchange  between  the  bank's  sustainability  champions  to support bank-wide change and to identify new topics.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Chief Sustainability Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer. He has the mandate to develop the bank's sustainability  strategy  across  businesses,  infrastructure  functions  and  regions  and  drive  its  implementation.  The  Chief Sustainability  Office  consists  of  three  areas:  the  Strategy  &  Regional  Governance  team,  which  is  responsible  for  the development of the corporate sustainability strategy and regional governance set-up. The Regional Governance sub-team was established in 2023 with a mandate to define and implement regional sustainability governance structures globally. Furthermore, the Execution, Data & Regulatory team, which is responsible for driving the strategic transformation program and identifying and assessing relevant regulations. In 2023, the bank's Sustainability Regulation function was established as a central function focusing on interpretation of key sustainability regulations and standards globally on a group wide basis within the Execution, Data & Regulatory team. The third team, Group Sustainability, is responsible for advancing the bank's sustainability policies and commitments, human rights issues and their monitoring and the dialogue with external stakeholders, including ESG rating management. In 2023, Deutsche Bank appointed a dedicated Head of Human Rights within Group Sustainability to further strengthen its human rights management. Moreover, the bank's business divisions and infrastructure functions established ESG expert teams to foster the sustainability strategy implementation on divisional level and to enable swift response to emerging business opportunities and risks.\n\nThe transformation of the bank with regard to sustainability-related targets and goals is a component for the bank's top executives' performance-based compensation.\n\nIn DWS, the DWS Executive Board is supported by the DWS Group Sustainability Committee, which is empowered to take decisions that implement the sustainability strategy.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nDeutsche Bank set the target to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes of \u20ac 500 billion in the period from January 2020 to end of 2025 (excluding DWS); which transactions can be classified as sustainable is documented in Deutsche Bank's Sustainable Finance Framework and published on Deutsche Bank's website.",

        "page_content": "## Policies and Commitments\n\nIn March 2023, Deutsche Bank updated its thermal coal guideline by tightening the criteria when a company is deemed a thermal coal company and in scope of the guideline, as well as specifying the requirements to be applied to clients in scope of the updated guideline.\n\nAs the first banking partner of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), Deutsche Bank signed the #BackBlue ocean  finance  commitment,  which  ensures  that  ocean  protection  is  incorporated  in  finance  and  insurance  decisions,  in December 2023. Moreover, the bank engaged in the Impact Disclosure Taskforce along with other financial institutions with the aim to scale financing of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe bank further enhanced its risk management and related processes to prevent human rights violations in its supply chain in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA).\n\nAs part of its Net-Zero Banking Alliance commitment, Deutsche Bank published its initial Transition Plan in October 2023, summarizing its decarbonization strategy and actions along three dimensions: own operations (Scope 1 and 2), supply chain (disclosed Scope 3: Category 1 to 14); and the financing the bank provides to its clients (Scope 3: Category 15). Along with this publication, the bank announced three additional sectoral emission reduction targets in the corporate loan portfolio for Shipping, Cement and Coal Mining after having published pathway targets for four sectors in the previous year (i.e.,  Oil  &  Gas,  Automotive,  Power  Generation  and  Steel).  In  addition  to  that,  the  bank  set  the  ambition  that  from  2026 onwards, at least 90% of the high emitting clients in the most carbon intensive sectors that engage in new corporate lending transactions with Deutsche Bank shall have a net-zero commitment in place.\n\n## People and Own Operations\n\nFrom end of 2019 to end of September 2023, Deutsche Bank reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 71%, to 44,814 tones of CO2e. In 2023, the bank received 97% of its own global electricity consumption from renewable sources and is on its way to achieve its 100% renewable electricity target by 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank continued to engage with vendors to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions focusing on Purchased Goods and Services (Scope 3: Category 1), representing 78% of total operational Scope 3 emissions from October 2022 to September 2023 (excluding financed emissions, Scope 3: Category 15).\n\n32.3% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President positions were held by women by end of 2023.\n\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank rolled out a 'Sustainable Finance' training for client facing staff, contributed to conserve marine biodiversity as part of one of the bank's environmental CSR programs 'How We Live' and funded community conservation projects in several Asian-Pacific countries by partnering with The Nature Conservancy.\n\n## Thought Leadership and Stakeholder Engagement\n\nDeutsche Bank's Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing became a member in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero (GFANZ) Principals Group in July 2023.\n\nIn March 2023, Deutsche Bank hosted its second Sustainability Deep Dive. At the event senior leaders spoke to almost 1,700 clients, investors, analysts, and employees about the sustainability strategy and how Deutsche Bank supports its clients on their way to net-zero. At the 2023 UN climate conference in Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Deutsche Bank co-hosted a client event and panel discussions on 'Decarbonizing Industry: A German Lense' with six German industry partners as well as the Future Institute for Sustainable Transformation of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin.\n\nIn October 2023, the bank set up a Nature Advisory Panel, which aims to help the bank assess nature-related risks and identify new financial product offerings tied to the challenge of reversing biodiversity loss. In addition to that, Deutsche Bank acted as Co-Lead of Net-Zero Banking Alliance's Real Estate Working Group and played a major role in the publication of its emerging practice paper on 'Climate Target Setting for Real Estate Sector Financing'.",

Hiring focused on filling front office roles in growth areas (such as at Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management), strengthening the control- and IT-function, replacing operation-center employees who left voluntarily and onboarding talents to meet the growing demand for regulatory roles (such as Client Lifecycle Management and Anti-Financial Crime).\n\nThe bank remains committed to its strategic priority of hiring university graduates. In 2023, the bank hired 1,177 university graduates (2022: 793). The bank also insourced 1,308 external roles (2022: 1,806), particularly in IT.\n\n## Promoting internal career mobility\n\nInternal  mobility  plays  a  vital  role  in  developing  and  retaining  qualified,  talented  employees  and  ensuring  that  the  bank continues  to  benefit  from  their  expertise  and  experience.  The  bank  fosters  mobility  between  divisions,  which  enables employees  to  broaden  their  skills  and  experience.  Moreover,  internal  mobility  helps  reduce  the  bank's  redundancy  and recruitment costs.\n\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank continued to implement its internal mobility strategy and live up to its commitment to filling one-third of all vacant positions with suitable candidates from within the organization. Vacant positions are typically first advertised inside the group for at least two weeks. Prioritizing internal candidates helps employees affected by restructuring find new roles in the bank.\n\nIn 2023, 29.9% (2022: 27.3%) of all job vacancies were filled internally (2022 excluding Postbank). On average, it took 89 days to fill vacant positions (2022: 86 days).",

The bank aims to attract, develop, and retain talented employees from all cultures, countries, races,  ethnicities,  genders,  sexual  orientations,  disabilities,  beliefs,  backgrounds,  and  experiences.  To  better  reflect  the diversity of the societies in which it operates and the clients it serves, the bank has an ambition to increase the number of women and people of all ethnicities in senior, decision-making and client facing roles. The bank wants all its employees to feel a sense of belonging by creating an inclusive work environment where everyone feels welcomed, respected, listened to, treated fairly, and can contribute and grow.\n\nThroughout 2023 the bank continued to embed diversity, equity and inclusion in its culture and employee practices by including supporting the advancement of women and members of other under-represented, groups. The bank takes a multi-dimensional approach including targeted outreach to attract and hire diverse talent, enhanced career planning, leadership development, exposure opportunities and senior leader sponsorship. The bank continues to equip its people with resources to practice inclusion and understand how to make equitable people-related decisions.\n\nAt year-end 2023, eight or 40% of Supervisory Board members were women (2022: 30%). This met the statutory requirement of 30% for publicly listed and codetermined German companies pursuant to gender quota legislation that took effect in 2015.\n\nThe current German Gender Quota Law (Zweites F\u00fchrungspositionen-Gesetz, F\u00fcPoG II) requires appointing at least one woman and one man to a management board with more than three members, no additional goals must be laid down. With Rebecca Short on the Management Board the bank met this requirement as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs part of the bank's 35 by 25 commitment, the bank aims to have women to represent at least 35% of its Managing Director, Director,  and  Vice  President  population  by  2025  (Business  Divisions  (excluding  Asset  Management)  and  Infrastructure Functions).  This  goal  also  forms  part  of  the  key  performance  indicators  on  the  'Balanced  Scorecard'  assessing  the Management Board and Group Management Committee. Gender diversity for senior corporate titles increased by 1.6%-points to 32.3% in 2023 (2022: 30.7%).\n\nThe bank also plans to have at least 30% women in the positions one and two levels below the Management Board (Business Divisions  (excluding  Asset  Management)  and  Infrastructure  Functions).  Gender  diversity  in  position  one  below  the Management Board increased by 2.9%-points to 20.0% in 2023 (2022: 17.1%) and decreased in position two below the Management Board by 2.0%-points to 27.6% in 2023 (2022: 29.6%).\n\nThe bank is committed to increasing the proportion of women in senior leadership positions across the organization, but it is the bank's individual businesses that deliver on this commitment. Since cultures and social challenges vary by country and type of business, each of the bank's regions and business has its own diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The bank has put in place targeted initiatives to accelerate change. These initiatives have been implemented along the full employee life cycle, from attracting and hiring talent to developing, retaining, and promoting it. The 35 by 25 program is sponsored and actively supported by the Management Board and Group Management Committee. Since 2023, each of the bank's decisionmaking committees is required to regularly review its composition to improve diversity of thought and support the bank's commitment to increase the proportion of women in senior, decision making roles.",

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chairman of the Supervisory Board and our Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. In addition to the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements for  external  reporting  purposes  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  issued  by  the International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  (EU).  Our  Internal  control  over financial reporting includes our disclosure controls and procedures designed to prevent misstatements.\n\n## Risks in Financial Reporting\n\nThe primary risks in financial reporting are that either financial statements do not present a true and fair view due to inadvertent or intentional errors (fraud) or the publication of financial statements is not performed on a timely basis. These risks may reduce investor confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal consequences including banking regulatory interventions.  A  lack  of  fair  presentation  arises  when  one  or  more  financial  statement  amounts,  or  disclosures  contain misstatements (or omissions) that are material. Misstatements are deemed material if they could, individually or in aggregate, influence economic decisions that users make because of the financial statements.\n\nTo confine those risks of financial reporting, management of the Group has established internal control over financial reporting with the aim of providing reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements. In addition, an assessment was conducted of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting. This was based on the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO recommends the establishment of specific objectives to facilitate the design and evaluate adequacy of a control system. As a result, in establishing internal control over financial reporting, management has adopted the following financial statement objectives:\n\n- -Existence - assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred;\n- -Completeness - all transactions are recorded and account balances are included in the financial statements;\n- -Valuation - assets, liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial statements at the appropriate amounts;\n- -Rights, Obligations and Ownership - rights, obligations and ownership are appropriately recorded as assets and liabilities;\n- -Presentation and Disclosures - classification, disclosure and presentation of financial reporting is appropriate;\n- -Safeguarding of assets - unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, any internal control system, including internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. As such, disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  systems  for  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  all  errors; inadvertent or intentional errors (fraud). Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods, are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\n\n## Controls to Minimize the Risk of Financial Reporting Misstatement\n\nThe system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- -Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records,  that,  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the company's assets;\n- -Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of the company's management and;\n- -Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Measuring Effectiveness of Internal Control\n\nEach year, management of the Group undertakes a formal evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  This  evaluation  incorporates  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  control environment as well as individual controls which make up the system of internal control over financial reporting and considers:\n\n- -The  financial  misstatement  risk  of  the  financial  statement  line  items,  considering  such  factors  as  materiality  and  the susceptibility of the financial statement item to misstatement; and,\n- -The susceptibility of identified controls to failure, considering such factors as the degree of automation, complexity, and risk of management override, competence of personnel and the level of judgment required.\n\nThese factors determine in their entirety the type and scope of the evidence required by \u00a7 315 HGB, which the management needs to assess whether or not the established internal control over financial reporting is effective. The evidence itself is generated from procedures integrated within the daily responsibilities of staff or from procedures implemented specifically for purposes of the internal control over financial reporting evaluation. Information from other sources also form an important component of the evaluation since such evidence may either bring additional control issues to the attention of management or may corroborate findings. Such information sources may include:\n\n- -Reports on audits carried out by or on behalf of regulatory authorities;\n- -External Auditor reports; and,\n- -Reports commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of outsourced processes to third parties.\n\nIn  addition,  Group  Audit  evaluates  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  by performing periodic and ad-hoc risk-based audits. Reports are produced summarizing the results from each audit which are distributed to the responsible managers for the activities concerned. These reports also provide evidence to support the annual evaluation by management of the overall operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs a result of the evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is appropriately designed and operating effectively as of December 31, 2023.",

The number of Management Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to the Articles of Association, the Management Board has at least three members. The Supervisory Board may appoint one or two members of the Management Board as Chairpersons of the Management Board. Members of the Management Board may be appointed for a maximum term of up to five years. They may be reappointed or have their term extended for one or more terms of up to a maximum of five years each. The German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; Section 31) requires a majority of at least two thirds of the members of the Supervisory Board to appoint members of the Management Board. If such majority is not achieved, the Mediation Committee shall give, within one month, a recommendation for the appointment to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board will then  appoint  the  members  of  the  Management  Board  with  the  majority  of  its  members.  If  such  appointment  fails,  the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board shall have two votes in a new vote. If a required member of the Management Board has not been appointed, the Local Court (Amtsgericht) in Frankfurt am Main shall, in urgent cases, make the necessary appointments upon motion by any party concerned (Section 85 of the Stock Corporation Act).\n\nPursuant to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank (SSM Framework Regulation) evidence must be provided to the European Central Bank (ECB), the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Deutsche Bundesbank that the member of the Management Board has adequate theoretical and practical experience of the businesses of the Bank as well as managerial experience before the member is appointed (Sections 24 (1) No. 1 and 25c (1) of the Banking Act, Article 93 of the SSM Framework Regulation).\n\nThe Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Management Board or as Chairperson of the Management Board for good cause. Such cause includes in particular a gross breach of duties, the inability to manage the Bank properly or a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders' meeting (Hauptversammlung, referred to as the General Meeting), unless such vote of no-confidence was made for obviously arbitrary reasons.\n\nThe ECB or the BaFin may appoint a special representative and transfer to such special representative the responsibility and powers of individual members of the Management Board if such members are not trustworthy or do not have the required competencies or if the credit institution does not have the required number of Management Board members. In any such case, the responsibility and powers of the Management Board members concerned are suspended (Section 45c (1) through (3) of the Banking Act, Article 93 (2) of the SSM Framework Regulation).\n\n## Rules Governing the Amendment of the Articles of Association\n\nAny  amendment  of  the  Articles  of  Association  requires  a  resolution  of  the  General  Meeting  (Section  179  of  the  Stock Corporation Act). The authority to amend the Articles of Association in so far as such amendments merely relate to the wording, such as changes of the share capital as a result of the issuance out of authorized capital, has been assigned to the Supervisory Board by the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 20 (3)). Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the resolutions of the General Meeting are taken by a simple majority of votes and, in so far as a majority of capital stock is required, by a simple  majority  of  capital  stock,  except  where  law  or  the  Articles  of  Association  determine  otherwise  (Section  20  (1)). Amendments to the Articles of Association become effective upon their entry in the Commercial Register (Section 181 (3) of the Stock Corporation Act).",

In this context, the shares acquired for this purpose may not, at the end of any day, exceed 5% of the share capital of Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of May 17, 2023 authorized the Management Board pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act to buy, on or before April 30, 2028, own shares of Deutsche Bank AG in a total volume of up to 10% of the share capital at the time the resolution was taken or - if the value is lower - of the share capital at the time this authorization is exercised. Together with own shares acquired for trading purposes and/or for other reasons and which are from time to time in the company's possession or attributable to the company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq. of the Stock Corporation Act, the own shares purchased on the basis of this authorization may not at any time exceed 10% of the company's respectively applicable share capital. The own shares may be bought through the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer to  all  shareholders.  The  consideration  for  the  purchase  of  shares  (excluding  ancillary  purchase  costs)  through  the  stock exchange may not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before the obligation to purchase. In the case of a public purchase offer, it may not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before the day of publication of the offer. If the volume of shares offered in a public purchase offer exceeds the planned buyback volume, acceptance must be in proportion to the shares offered in each case. The preferred acceptance of small quantities of up to 50 of the company's shares offered for purchase per shareholder may be defined.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to dispose of the purchased shares and of any shares purchased on the basis of previous authorizations pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act on the stock exchange or by an offer  to  all  shareholders.  The  Management  Board  has  been  authorized  to  dispose  of  the  purchased  shares  against contribution-in kind and with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights for the purpose of acquiring companies or shareholdings in companies or other assets that serve the company's business operations.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to use shares purchased on the basis of authorizations pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 Stock Corporation Act to issue staff shares, with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights, to employees and retired employees of the company and its affiliated companies or to use them to service option rights on shares of the company and/or rights or duties to purchase shares of the company granted to employees or members of executive or nonexecutive management bodies of the company and of affiliated companies.\n\nFurthermore, the Management Board has been authorized, with the exclusion of shareholders' pre-emptive rights, to sell such own shares to third parties against cash payment if the purchase price is not substantially lower than the price of the shares on the stock exchange at the time of sale. Use may only be made of this authorization if it has been ensured that the number of  shares  sold  on  the  basis  of  this  authorization  does  not  exceed  10%  of  the  company's  share  capital  at  the  time  this authorization becomes effective or - if the amount is lower - at the time this authorization is exercised. Shares that are issued or sold during the validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights, in direct or analogous application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock Corporation Act, are to be included in the maximum limit of 10% of the share capital. Also to be included are shares that are to be issued to service option and/or conversion rights from convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participatory rights or participatory rights, if these bond or participatory rights are issued during the validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights in corresponding application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock Corporation Act.\n\nThe Management Board has also been authorized to cancel shares acquired on the basis of this or a preceding authorization without the execution of this cancellation process requiring a further resolution by the General Meeting.",

The company may accordingly sell to third parties put options based on physical delivery and buy call options from third parties if it is ensured by the option conditions that these options are fulfilled only with shares which themselves were acquired subject to compliance with the principle of equal treatment. All share purchases based on put or call options are limited to shares in a maximum volume of 5% of the actual share capital at the time of the resolution by the General Meeting on this authorization. The term of the options must be selected such that the share purchase upon exercising the option is carried out at the latest on April 30, 2028.\n\nThe purchase price to be paid for the shares upon exercise of the put options or upon the maturity of the forward purchase may not exceed more than 10% or fall below 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three stock exchange trading days before conclusion of the respective transaction in each case excluding ancillary purchase costs but taking into account the option premium received.

The management of Deutsche Bank Group is based on IFRS results of the bank's corporate divisions. Deutsche Bank AG is fully integrated in the initiatives and target setting of Deutsche Bank Group. The performance of the Group is ultimately driving the performance of Deutsche Bank AG. Further, the bank has utilized the option under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) with respect to regulatory capital so that regulatory capital ratios are only applicable on Group level.\n\nTherefore, information that has been provided regarding Deutsche Bank Group in this combined management report in general also is relevant and applies to Deutsche Bank AG. Additional information that facilitates an understanding of Deutsche Bank AG is contained in this section. The financial information in this section has been prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch', HGB), unless stated otherwise. Further details on financial information prepared in accordance with HGB can be found in the notes to the financial statements for Deutsche Bank AG in a separate report.\n\n## Deutsche Bank AG Performance\n\nOne parameter to evaluate the performance of the Group is the ability to make distributions to shareholders. This ability depends on the availability of distributable profits of Deutsche Bank AG determined in accordance with HGB. Beyond that the financial information of Deutsche Bank AG prepared in accordance with HGB is generally less relevant to assess or steer the Group's financial performance due to the circumstances set forth in the introduction above.\n\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of \u20ac 5.0 billion compared to net profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion in 2022.\n\nThe operating profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion was higher by \u20ac 5.7 billion compared to prior year. Improved trading results and higher current income led to an increase of total revenues by \u20ac 2.2 billion compared to prior year. In addition, lower interest rate levels at year end drove an increase in the return from pension plan assets by \u20ac 1.9 billion and higher result from securities of the liquidity reserve, up by \u20ac 1.1 billion.\n\nThe  result  outside  operating  profit  was  mainly  driven  by  net  negative  valuation  adjustments  of  investments  in  affiliated companies of  \u20ac 740 million  and  by  a  net  extraordinary  result  of  negative  \u20ac 157 million.  Partly  offsetting,  a  tax  benefit  of \u20ac 646 million contributed to the net income of \u20ac 5.0 billion.\n\nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of \u20ac 0.45 per share, appropriate \u20ac 2.0 billion to the revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.",

The net interest result from lending and securities less interest expenses deceased slightly by \u20ac 370 million, mainly driven by a higher increase of interest on liabilities compared to interest revenue from assets.\n\n## Net commission income\n\nNet commission income of \u20ac 6.2 billion increased by \u20ac 129 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher fee net income from intermediary and other services rendered.\n\n## Net trading result\n\nNet trading result in 2023 was \u20ac 4.8 billion, an increase of \u20ac 1.9 billion compared to prior year. This increase was mainly driven by reduced expenses for currency translation.",

In Europe excluding Germany the number of employees increased primarily in UK mainly driven by increases in the Investment Bank and by strengthening the control functions.\n\nOther  administrative  costs  were  \u20ac 10.1 billion  in  2023,  an  increase  of  \u20ac 322 million  from  \u20ac 9.8 billion  in  2022. Other administrative expenses (excluding scheduled depreciation and amortization on tangible and intangible assets) increased by \u20ac 290 million to \u20ac 8.9 billion. This development was mainly driven by higher costs for services rendered by group companies, up by \u20ac 328 million and higher operating and maintenance costs, up by \u20ac 127 million, partly offset by lower bank levies, down by \u20ac 219 million. Scheduled depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets were \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2023, up by \u20ac 32 million.\n\n## Net balance of operating income and expenses\n\nThe balance of other operating income/expenses amounted to positive \u20ac 929 million in 2023 after negative \u20ac 1.3 billion in 2022. This improvement of \u20ac 2.2 billion was mainly driven by lower net expenses on pension plan assets and staff related provisions, down by \u20ac 1.9 billion.\n\n## Net risk provisioning\n\nIn 2023, total net risk provisioning, consisting of changes in credit related risk provisioning and the net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve, amounted to \u20ac 514 million, a reduction by \u20ac 1.1 billion compared to 2022. This development was almost completely attributable to an improved net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve, up by \u20ac 1.1 billion, whereas provisioning in the loan business remained nearly unchanged. The improved net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve was caused by the decrease in interest rate levels at year-end 2023, leading to higher valuations.\n\n## Net balance of other ordinary income/expenses\n\nThe balance of other ordinary income and expenses was negative \u20ac 956 million (2022: positive \u20ac 3.8 billion), consisting of net valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, write-downs and non-scheduled depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and expenses from loss take-over.\n\nNet  valuation  adjustments  and  net  results  from  disposals  of  investments  in  affiliated  companies  amounted  to  negative \u20ac 740 million (2022: positive \u20ac 4.2 billion), mainly relating to various banking subsidiaries in Europe.\n\nIn addition, write-downs and non-scheduled depreciation of tangible and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac 103 million in 2023, mainly related to furniture and equipment (2022: \u20ac 92 million).\n\nExpenses from loss take-over amounted to \u20ac 113 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac 281 million).\n\n## Extraordinary result\n\nNet extraordinary income and expenses were negative \u20ac 157 million, mainly relating to restructuring activities (2022: positive \u20ac 95 million).",

The current year's tax benefit was mainly driven by changes in the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Net profit and proposed appropriation\n\nDeutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of \u20ac 5.0 billion in 2023, compared to a net profit of \u20ac 5.5 billion in 2022.\n\nAfter an addition to revenue reserves of \u20ac 2.0 billion, the 2023 distributable profit amounted to \u20ac 3.5 billion. The Bank will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of  \u20ac 0.45 per share. This will reduce the distributable profit by up to \u20ac 918 million, depending on the number of shares outstanding at the record date. It will also be proposed to appropriate additional \u20ac 2.0 billion to revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nThe table below provides an overview of Deutsche Bank AG's balance sheet, which is followed by further information on the individual line items.\n\n## Condensed balance sheet\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                                                                                          | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   | in \u20ac m.   | Change  in %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Assets                                                                                                                                           |                |                |           |                |\n| Receivables from banks and customers incl. balances with central banks and  debt instruments of public-sector entities                           | 688,265        | 694,455        | (6,190)   | (1)            |\n| Participating interests and investments in affiliated companies                                                                                  | 29,488         | 30,927         | (1,438)   | (5)            |\n| Bonds and other securities and equity shares                                                                                                     | 71,724         | 70,912         | 812       | 1              |\n| Trading Assets                                                                                                                                   | 247,596        | 234,670        | 12,926    | 6              |\n| Remaining other assets                                                                                                                           | 23,158         | 21,379         | 1,778     | 8              |\n| Total assets                                                                                                                                     | 1,060,231      | 1,052,343      | 7,888     | 1              |\n| Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity                                                                                                             |                |                |           |                |\n| Liabilities to banks and customers                                                                                                               | 662,954        | 673,859        | (10,904)  | (2)            |\n| Liabilities in certificate form                                                                                                                  | 92,132         | 87,090         | 5,042     | 6              |\n| Trading liabilities                                                                                                                              | 191,329        | 178,394        | 12,935    | 7              |\n| Provisions                                                                                                                                       | 7,100          | 7,457          | (357)     | (5)            |\n| Capital and reserves                                                                                                                             | 43,552         | 39,625         | 3,927     | 10             |\n| Subordinated liabilities, Participation rights capital, Instruments for Additional  Tier 1 Regulatory Capital and Fund for general banking risks | 24,328         | 24,747         | (419)     | (2)            |\n| Remaining other liabilities                                                                                                                      | 38,835         | 41,171         | (2,336)   | (6)            |\n| Total liabilities and shareholders' equity                                                                                                       | 1,060,231      | 1,052,343      | 7,888     | 1              |\n\nTotal assets of Deutsche Bank AG amounted to \u20ac 1,060 billion as of December 31, 2023.

This development was primarily driven by a decrease in Claims on customers by \u20ac 21.3 billion (5%) to \u20ac 412.7 billion and partly offset by an increase in Loans to banks, which are reported under total credit extended, by \u20ac 14.4 billion (30%) to \u20ac 62.2 billion.",

This was mainly driven by an increase in securities qualifying as trading, which grew by \u20ac 31.4 billion (49%) to \u20ac 95.9 billion, as well by an increase of receivables qualifying as trading, higher by \u20ac 2.9 billion (4%) to \u20ac 76.2 billion, partly offset by a decrease of \u20ac 21.8 billion (23%) to \u20ac 74.5 billion in positive market values from trading derivatives.\n\n## Deposits and securitized liabilities\n\nLiabilities to banks decreased slightly and amounted to \u20ac 145.2 billion for 2023, while liabilities to customers remained almost stable at to \u20ac 517.7 billion, lower by \u20ac 7.6 billion (1%) compared to December 31, 2022. Within this item, the composition changed. Other liabilities repayable on demand decreased by \u20ac 40.6 billion (12%) from \u20ac 345.0 billion to \u20ac 304.4 billion. This was partly offset by an increase in savings deposits by \u20ac 4.6 billion (8%) from \u20ac 59.6 billion to \u20ac 64.3 billion and by an increase in other liabilities with agreed period or notice period by \u20ac 28.4 billion from \u20ac 120.6 billion to \u20ac 149.0 billion.\n\nLiabilities in certificate from amounted to \u20ac 92.1 billion, up \u20ac 5.0 billion (6%) in comparison to December 31, 2022. The increase was partly driven by an increase of bonds and notes issued by \u20ac 1.7 billion (2%) compared to December 31, 2022, and other liabilities in certificate form by \u20ac 3.3 billion (102%) to \u20ac 6.5 billion.\n\n## Breakdown of liabilities\n\n|                                       |              |              | Change   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|\n| in \u20ac bn.                              | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 | in \u20ac bn. | in %     |\n| Liabilities to banks                  | 145          | 149          | (3)      | (2)      |\n| repayable on demand                   | 69           | 64           | 6        | 9        |\n| with agreed period or notice period   | 76           | 85           | (9)      | (11)     |\n| Liabilities to customers              | 518          | 525          | (8)      | (1)      |\n| savings deposits                      | 64           | 60           | 5        | 8        |\n| other liabilities                     |              |              |          |          |\n| repayable on demand                   | 304          | 345          | (41)     | (12)     |\n| with agreed period or notice period   | 149          | 121          | 28       | 24       |\n| Liabilities in certificate form       | 92           | 87           | 5        | 6        |\n| bonds and notes issued                | 86           | 84           | 2        | 2        |\n| other liabilities in certificate form | 7            | 3            | 3        | 102      |\n| thereof: money market instruments     | 6            | 3            | 3        | 117      |",

The increase of \u20ac 3.9 billion is mainly attributable to the distributable profit generated in 2023 as well as an increase in other revenue reserves.\n\nConsistent with prior years, the Bank has utilized the option available under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) with respect to its regulatory capital and presents capital requirements for Deutsche Bank Group only.\n\nIn summary: The bank maintained its stable funding, high liquidity base and solid regulatory capital position which is based on Group capital.

        "page_content": "## Management of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group\n\nThe content in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the respective group sections in this Annual Report, especially 'Risk Report', 'Outlook', 'Risks and Opportunities' and 'Internal control over financial reporting'.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe impact of the risks on Deutsche Bank AG cannot be isolated from the effects on Deutsche Bank's other legal entities, mainly driven by:\n\n- -The Group's management structure, including its corporate divisions follows its customers' needs. The legal structure is determined by local legislation and therefore does not necessarily follow the management structure. For example, local legislation can determine whether the Group's business in a certain country is conducted by a branch of Deutsche Bank AG or by a separate subsidiary. However, the management has to monitor the risks in the bank's business - irrespective of whether it is transacted by a branch or a subsidiary.\n- -Adequate risk monitoring and management requires knowledge of the extent to which the Group's profit situation depends on the development of certain risk factors, i.e., on the creditworthiness of individual customers or securities issuers or on movements in market prices. The respective exposures therefore need to be analyzed across legal entities. Especially for the credit risk attached to a borrower, as it is irrelevant whether the credit exposure to a company is spread over several Group companies or concentrated on Deutsche Bank AG. Separate monitoring of the risk affecting Deutsche Bank AG alone would neglect the potential exposure facing the Group and, indirectly, Deutsche Bank AG - as the parent - if the company became insolvent.\n- -Individual risk factors are sometimes correlated, and in some cases, they are independent of each other. If estimates of the nature and extent of this correlation are available, the Group's management can significantly reduce the overall risk by diversifying its businesses across customer groups, issuers and countries. The risk correlation is also independent of the Group's legal and divisional structure. Therefore, management can only optimize the risk-mitigating effects of diversification if it manages them Group-wide and across legal entities.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned, the identification, monitoring and management of all risks in Deutsche Bank AG are integrated into the Group-wide risk management process. Following Group policies, Deutsche Bank AG adheres to the respective legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Deutsche Bank AG stands at 127.5% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 130.8% as of December 31, 2022. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) amounts to 110.1% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 108.7% as of December 31, 2022. Both ratios are calculated separately to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity and stable funding at Deutsche Bank AG.\n\n## Outlook and Strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank AG as the parent company of the Group defines the strategy and planning for the individual Group Divisions. Deutsche  Bank  AG  participates  in  the  results  of  the  Group  Divisions  through  own  activities  and  profit  distribution  from subsidiaries. Therefore, the Group's outlook encompasses all Group Divisions and is not limited to the parent company.

The following items carry significant risk in this respect:\n\n- -Potential valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, driven by local political and economic environment, increased local regulatory requirements, restructuring or changes of share prices of listed investments.\n- -Increase  in  long-term  provisions,  especially  pension  obligations,  despite  rises  in  interest  rate  levels  caused  by  the discounting with average interest rates according to Section 253 (2) German Commercial Code.\n- -Negative valuation adjustments to plan assets, especially in an environment of rising interest rate levels. Due to the abovementioned valuation methodology, there might be no offsetting effect from lower pension obligations if interest rates are rising.\n- -Potential requirement to set up a provision according to German accounting pronouncement IDW RS BFA 3 in case the interest-bearing  banking  book  does  not  generate  an  interest  margin  sufficient  to  cover  expected  credit  risk  costs  and administrative expenses. A persisting low interest rate environment and the treatment of coupon payments related to the AT1 instruments as expenses under HGB increase this risk.\n\nIn addition, profits or retained earnings from affiliated companies might not allow for sufficient dividend payments to Deutsche Bank AG to facilitate dividend payments by Deutsche Bank AG as targeted.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDeutsche Bank AG as a solo entity reporting under HGB may have additional opportunities compared to the Group in that respect that certain transactions in a given year are reported in a more beneficial manner than for the Group under IFRS, such as realized gains which may be recognized in the income statement under IFRS in an earlier period.\n\nIn addition, there is the possibility that Deutsche Bank AG as parent entity shows profits in a given year that are higher than its contribution to the Group's net income, resulting from increased profit distributions from affiliated companies.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe controls that are performed for the Group's Annual Statements under IFRS apply to the bank's financial statements under HGB accordingly. In addition to these controls, specific HGB related controls are implemented which include:\n\n- -Inter-branch reconciliation and elimination are performed for HGB specific balances; and,\n- -Analytical reviews of revaluation and reclassification items between IFRS and HGB on the level of foreign branches and the German headquarters.\n\n## Non-financial Statement for Deutsche Bank AG\n\nThe details pursuant to Section 340a (1a) German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with Section 289b (3) HGB can be found as a combined separate non-financial report under https://investor-relations.db.com/reports-and-events/annual-reports/.",

Deutsche Bank together with all entities in which Deutsche Bank has a controlling financial interest (collectively the 'Group', or 'Deutsche Bank') is a global provider of a full range of corporate and investment banking, private clients and asset management products and services.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, the presentation currency of the Group. All financial information presented in million euros has been rounded to the nearest million. The consolidated financial statements have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  ('IFRS')  as  issued  by  the  International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and endorsed by the European Union (EU).\n\nPrior to publication on March 14, 2024, the Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements 2023 of the Group on March 13, 2024, which were drawn up by the Management Board on March 7, 2024.\n\n## EU carve-out\n\nThe Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The purpose of applying the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 is to align the Group's hedge accounting approach with its risk management practice and the accounting practice of its major European peers. Under the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS  39,  fair  value  macro  hedge  accounting  may  be  applied  to  core  deposits  and  hedge ineffectiveness is generally only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket. If the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designated amount then there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Under IFRS as issued by the IASB, hedge accounting for fair value macro hedges cannot be applied to core deposits. In addition, under IFRS as issued by the IASB hedge ineffectiveness arises for all fair value macro hedge accounting relationships whenever the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is either more or less than the original designated amount of that bucket. The EU carve  out  version  of  IAS  39  also  removes  the  prohibition  on  identifying  a  benchmark  risk  component  in  a  financial instrument  priced  at  sub-benchmark.  This  may  arise  when  financial  instruments  carry  a  negative  spread  such  that  the identified non-contractually specified risk component is larger than the interest carry on the contract itself.\n\nFor the financial year ended December 31, 2023, the application of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 had a negative impact of \u20ac 2.3 billion on profit before tax and of \u20ac 1.6 billion on profit after tax. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the application of the EU carve-out had a positive impact of \u20ac 147 million on profit before taxes and of \u20ac 105 million on profit post taxes.\n\nThe Group's regulatory capital and ratios thereof are also reported on the basis of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The impact on total equity also impacts the calculation of the CET1 capital ratio. For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact on the CET1 capital ratio of about 43 basis points and a positive impact of about 5 basis points for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## IFRS 7 disclosures (including war in Ukraine and climate risk related disclosures)\n\nDisclosures on risks related to the macroeconomic environment can be found in the sections in 'IFRS 9 Impairment', line item 'Focus areas in 2023' in the Risk Report, Note 35 'Derivatives', section 'Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting', Note 13 'Financial  Instruments  carried  at  Fair  Value',  sections  'Valuations  techniques'  and  'Sensitivity  analysis  of  unobservable parameters' as well as Note 14' Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value'.\n\nDisclosures about the nature and the extent of risks arising from financial instruments as required by IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' are set forth in the Risk Report section of the Combined Management Report and are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "Details on exposures and the impact on financial instrument impairment from the war in Ukraine can be found in the sections, 'IFRS 9 impairment' and 'Exposure to Russia' in the Risk Report. As of December 31, 2023, the Group discontinued its disclosure  relating  to  Market  Risk  to  Russia,  Russian  operations  and  Compliance  and  Anti  Financial  Crime  risks.  This considers the de-risking efforts the Group has undertaken. The Group continues to monitor its risks related to Russia and Ukraine as part of its regular risk management activities and enhanced governance oversight in place.\n\nDisclosures on climate related risk can be found in the sections, 'Enterprise Risk Management', line item 'Environmental, social and governance risk' in the Risk Report. The Group is exposed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk. The following are examples of how such risk may impact the financial results of the Group:\n\n- -Increases  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  climate  events  could  impact  client  ability  to  service  principal  and  interest payments under instruments subject to IFRS 9.\n- -Failure to comply with environmental and social legislation may impact client ability to generate sustainable returns to service their loans.\n- -If  in  the future clients do not hold sufficient insurance for physical assets against certain risks (e.g., flooding), this may impact the value of collateral held against certain type of loans.\n\nThe Group considers such ESG risk as part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence process before relevant clients are  granted  credit.  The  Group  also  manages  its  credit  portfolio  within  the  established  risk  appetite  and  limits.  Further accounting considerations, including risk consideration, for ESG indexed loans can be found in the section 'Financial assets' in the description of the material accounting policies below.\n\nThese audited disclosures are marked in light blue in the Risk Report.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions for certain categories of assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management's estimates. The Group's material accounting policies are described in 'Material Accounting Policies'.\n\nCertain of the Group's accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and may have a material impact on the Group's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The Group has identified the following material accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates:\n\n- -Impairment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (see 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-balance Sheet Positions' below)\n- -Determination of fair value (see 'Determination of Fair Value' below)\n- -Recognition of trade date profit (see 'Recognition of Trade Date Profit' below)\n- -Impairment of loans and provisions for off-balance sheet positions (see 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-balance Sheet Positions' below)\n- -Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles (see 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' below)\n- -Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets (see 'Income Taxes' below)\n- -Accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies and uncertain tax positions (see 'Provisions' below)\n\n## Material accounting policies\n\nThe following is a description of the matrial accounting policies of the Group. Except for the changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates described previously and noted below these policies have been consistently applied for 2021, 2022 and 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe financial information in the Consolidated Financial Statements includes the parent company, Deutsche Bank AG, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by the Group's ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity.\n\nThe Group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored by third parties for a variety of reasons, including allowing clients to hold investments in separate legal entities, allowing clients to invest jointly in alternative assets, for asset securitization transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection.\n\nWhen assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the Group evaluates a range of control factors, namely:\n\n- -Purpose and design of the entity\n- -Relevant activities and how these are determined\n- -Whether the Group's rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities\n- -Whether the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns\n- -Whether the Group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns\n\nWhere voting rights are relevant, the Group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities.\n\nPotential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.\n\nLikewise, the Group also assesses existence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise in circumstances where the size and dispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the Group the power to direct the activities of the investee.\n\n## Associates\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, over the operating and financial management policy decisions of the entity. Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the Group has significant influence. Among the other factors that are considered in determining whether the Group has  significant  influence  are  representation  on  the  board  of  directors  (supervisory  board  in  the  case  of  German  stock corporations) and material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could require the application of the equity method of accounting for a particular investment even though the Group's investment is less than 20% of the voting stock.\n\nUnder the equity  method  of  accounting,  the  Group's  investments  in  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are  initially recorded  at  cost  including  any  directly  related  transaction  costs  incurred  in  acquiring  the  associate,  and  subsequently increased (or decreased) to reflect both the Group's pro-rata share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss) of the associate or jointly controlled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or jointly controlled entity. The Group's share of the results of associates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the Group and is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Net income (loss) from equity method investments.\n\nIf  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment,  an  impairment test is performed  by comparing the investment's recoverable amount, which is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Group. Various entities in the Group use a different functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.\n\nAn entity records foreign currency revenues, expenses, gains and losses in its functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are translated at the period end closing rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit  or  loss  in  order  to  align  the  translation  amounts  with  those  recognized  from  foreign  currency  related  transactions (derivatives) which hedge these monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Translation differences on non-monetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFor purposes of translation into the presentation currency, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the period end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions, or average rates of exchange where these approximate actual rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. For foreign operations that are subsidiaries, the amount of exchange differences attributable to any noncontrolling interests is recognized in noncontrolling interests.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign subsidiary and associate (which results in loss of control or significant influence over that operation) the total cumulative exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nUpon partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary and which does not result in loss of control, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests as this is deemed a transaction with equity holders. For a partial disposal of an associate which does not result in a loss of significant influence, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.\n\n## Interest, commissions and fees\n\nNet interest income - Interest income and expense from all interest-bearing assets and liabilities is recognized as net interest income using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period using the estimated future cash flows.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows used in the EIR calculation include those determined by all of the contractual terms of the asset or liability, all fees (including commissions) that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate, direct and incremental transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. However, if the financial instrument is carried at fair value through  profit  or  loss,  any  associated  fees  are  recognized  in  trading  income  when  the  instrument  is  initially  recognized, provided there are no significant unobservable inputs used in determining its fair value.\n\nIf a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost amount. The amortized cost amount of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount of a financial asset after adjusting for any impairment allowance. For assets which are initially recognized as purchased or credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated through the use of a credit-adjusted effective interest rate which takes into consideration expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group presents negative interest paid on interest-bearing assets as interest expense, and interest revenue received from interest-bearing liabilities as interest income.",

        "page_content": "The Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Group's consolidated statement of income.\n\nCommissions and fee income -The Group applies the IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' five-step revenue recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income, under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred, hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied.\n\nAccordingly, after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step, the second step is to identify the performance obligation - or a series of distinct performance obligations - provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\n\nThe Group determines the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately, it estimates the stand-alone selling price at an amount using a suitable method, for example, in loan syndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide the  same service  on  an  unbundled  basis.  As  such  when  estimating  a  stand-alone  selling  price,  the  Group  considers  all information  (including  market  conditions)  that  is  reasonably  available  to  it.  In  doing  so,  the  Group  maximizes  the  use  of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.\n\nThe Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that  performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed.\n\nLoan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement, the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loan's effective interest rate.\n\nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time: Administration, assets under management, foreign commercial business, loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not.\n\nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transaction-type services include: other securities, underwriting and advisory fees, brokerage fees, local payments, foreign currency/ exchange business and intermediary fees.\n\nExpenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where the Group contractually owns the performance obligation (i.e. as Principal) in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and associated expense. In contrast, it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. The gross Commissions and Fee Income and Expense amounts are disclosed in 'Note 6 - Commissions and Fee Income'.",

        "page_content": "## Financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9, where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or 'SPPI'). There are three business models available:\n\n- -Hold to Collect - Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n- -Hold to Collect and Sell - Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n- -Other - Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either 'Hold to Collect' or 'Hold to Collect and Sell'. They are recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of this assessment, the Group considers quantitative factors (e.g., the expected frequency and volume of sales) and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Group's key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model, in particular, the way in which those  market  and  credit  risks  are  managed;  and  how  managers  of  the  business  are  compensated  (e.g.,  whether  the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model.\n\nIf the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model, then an assessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash flows, that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time; and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events, such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG metrics, the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in cash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. Additionally, as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending is non-recourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is dependent on the nature of the underlying, the level of subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. The Group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the Other business model because they are either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. In addition, it includes financial assets that meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business model, but the financial asset fails SPPI or where the Group designated the financial assets under the fair value option.\n\nFinancial assets classified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in Net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Interest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are presented in Interest and Similar Income.\n\nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTrading assets - Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been originated, acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term, or they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Trading assets include  debt  and  equity  securities,  derivatives  held  for  trading  purposes,  and  trading  loans.  This  also  includes  loan commitments that are allocated to the Other business model and that are presented as derivatives held for trading.",

        "page_content": "Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss The Group assigns any non-trading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models into the Other business model and  classifies  them  as  Non-Trading  Financial  Assets  mandatory  at  Fair  Value  through  Profit  and  Loss.  This  includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset that falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not SPPI is classified by the Group as Non-Trading Financial Assets Mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss.\n\nFinancial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss - Certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured subsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, may be designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA financial asset shall be classified and measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI'), if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect and Sell business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI, unless designated under the fair value option.\n\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. Realized gains and losses are reported in net gains (losses) on financial assets at FVOCI. Generally, the weighted-average cost method is used to determine the cost of FVOCI financial assets.\n\nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at FVOCI.\n\nIt is possible to designate non-trading equity instruments as FVOCI. However, this category is expected to have limited usage by the Group and has not been used to date.\n\n## Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nA financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI.\n\nUnder this measurement category, the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. Subsequently the carrying amount is reduced for principal payments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method. The financial asset is assessed for impairment under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model where provisions are recognized based on expectations of potential credit losses. The Group's impairment of financial instruments policy is described further in the section 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions (IFRS 9)'. The Group applies settlement date accounting to financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\nFinancial Assets at amortized cost include predominately Loans at amortized cost, Central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in Other Assets.\n\n## Modification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The modified financial asset will continue to accrued interest at its original EIR. When a modification results in derecognition the original instrument is derecognized and the new instrument recognized at fair value.\n\nNon-credit related or commercial renegotiations where an obligor has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination, and has a readily exercisable right to early terminate the financial asset results in derecognition of the original agreement and recognition of a new financial asset based on the newly negotiated commercial terms.\n\nFor credit related modifications (i.e. those modifications due to significant increase in credit risk since inception) or those where the obligor does not have the readily exercisable right to early terminate, the Group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. This assessment includes a quantitative assessment of the impact of the change in cash flows from the modification of contractual terms and additionally, where necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these modifications are not concluded to be significant, the financial asset is not derecognized and is accounted for as a modification as described above.",

The Group then recognizes a credit loss allowance based on 12-month expected credit losses. However, if following a modification that results in a derecognition of the original financial asset, there is evidence that the new financial asset is credit-impaired on initial recognition; then the new financial asset should be recognized as an originated credit-impaired financial asset and initially classified in Stage 3 (refer to section 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions' below).\n\nWhen the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated or modified then the Group assesses whether the modified terms result in  the  financial  liability  being  significantly  modified  and  therefore  derecognized.  This  assessment  includes  a  quantitative assessment of the impact of the change in cash flows from the modification of contractual terms and additionally, where necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these modifications are not concluded to be significant, the financial liability is not derecognized and a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where there is derecognition the original financial liability is derecognized and the new liability recognized at its fair value.\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nLoan commitments remain off-balance sheet, unless allocated to the Other business model and presented as derivatives held for trading. The Group does not recognize and measure changes in fair value of off-balance sheet loan commitments that result from changes in market interest rates or credit spreads. However, as specified in the sections 'Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions' below, these off-balance sheet loan commitments are in scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS 9 financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include Trading Liabilities, Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss and Non-Participating Investment Contracts ('Investment Contracts'). Under IFRS 9 they are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value movements attributable to the Group's own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nInterest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTrading liabilities Financial liabilities that arise from debt issued are classified as held for trading if they have been originated or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. Trading liabilities consist primarily of derivative liabilities (including certain loan commitments) and short positions. This also includes loan commitments where the resulting loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment is classified as derivatives held for trading.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss Certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition of trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair value through profit or loss, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; (2) a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (3) the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless: (a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or (b) it is clear with little or no analysis that separation is prohibited. In addition, the Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial liabilities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss, under the fair value option, include repurchase agreements, loan commitments and structured note liabilities.",

        "page_content": "Investment contracts All of the Group's investment contracts are unit-linked contracts that match specific assets held by the Group.  The  contracts  oblige  the  Group  to  use  these  assets  to  settle  investment  contract  liabilities.  They  do  not  contain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. The contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. As this amount represents fair value, the liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Deposits collected under investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract liabilities. Investment income attributable to investment contracts is included in the consolidated statement of Income. Investment contract claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released. Investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration, investment management, surrenders or other contract services.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nSome hybrid financial liability contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative component. In such cases, the derivative component is termed an embedded derivative, with the non-derivative component representing the host financial liability contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host financial liability contract and the hybrid financial liability contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded derivative  is  bifurcated  and  reported  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recognized  in  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host financial liability contract will continue to be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. The carrying amount of an embedded derivative is reported in the same Consolidated balance sheet line item as the host financial liability contract. Certain hybrid financial liability instruments have been designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost include long-term and short-term debt issued which are initially measured at fair value, which is the consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Repurchases of issued debt in the market are treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. A subsequent sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt. The Group applies settlement date accounting to financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented in the Consolidated balance sheet, only if the Group holds a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to set off the recognized amounts must be enforceable in  both  the  normal  course  of  business  and  in  the  event  of  default,  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  of  both  the  Group  and  its counterparty. In all other situations they are presented gross. When financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the Consolidated balance sheet, the associated income and expense items will also be offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income, unless specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard.\n\nThe majority of the offsetting applied by the Group relates to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. For further information please refer to Note 17 'Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities'.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm's length transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets  is  determined  using  the  quoted  prices  where  they  represent  those  at  which  regularly  and  recently  occurring transactions take place.\n\nThe Group measures certain portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of their net risk exposures when the following criteria are met:\n\n- -The group of financial assets and liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy,\n- -The fair values are provided to key management personnel, and\n- -The financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThis portfolio valuation approach is consistent with how the Group manages its net exposures to market and counterparty credit risks.",

        "page_content": "Critical accounting estimates - The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices quoted in active markets are not available. Therefore, where possible, parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are based on observable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which will depend on the price transparency for the instrument or market and the instrument's complexity.\n\nIn reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. The areas requiring significant management judgment are identified, documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control process and the standard monthly reporting cycle. The specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus attention on the areas of subjectivity and judgment.\n\nThe level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted price in an active market is usually minimal. Similarly there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets.\n\nThe level of subjectivity and degree of management judgment required is more significant for those instruments valued using specialized  and  sophisticated  models  and  where  some  or  all  of  the  parameter  inputs  are  less  liquid  or  less  observable. Management judgment is required in the selection and application of appropriate parameters, assumptions and modelling techniques. In particular, where data are obtained from infrequent market transactions then extrapolation and interpolation techniques must be applied. Where no market data are available for a particular instrument then pricing inputs are determined by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions, and making appropriate adjustment to reflect the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions. Where different valuation techniques indicate a range of possible fair values for an instrument then management has to decide what point within the range of estimates appropriately represents the fair value. Further, some valuation adjustments may require the exercise of management judgment to achieve fair value.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the valuation method that are used to determine their fair value. Specifically, segmentation is required between those valued using quoted market prices in an active market (level 1), valuation techniques based on observable parameters (level 2) and valuation techniques using significant unobservable parameters (level 3). Management judgment is required in determining the category to which certain instruments should be allocated. This specifically arises when the valuation is determined by a number of parameters, some of which are observable and others are not. Further, the classification of an instrument can change over time to reflect changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency.\n\nThe Group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level 3 financial instruments of using a reasonably possible alternative  for  the  unobservable  parameter.  The  determination  of  reasonably  possible  alternatives  requires  significant management judgment.\n\nFor financial instruments measured at amortized cost (which include loans, deposits and short and long term debt issued) the Group discloses the fair value. Generally there is limited or no trading activity in these instruments and therefore the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.\n\nFor further discussion of the valuation methods and controls and quantitative disclosures with respect to the determination of fair  value,  please  refer  to  Note 13  'Financial  Instruments  carried  at  Fair  Value'  and  Note 14  'Fair  Value  of  Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value'.",

        "page_content": "## Recognition of trade date profit\n\nTrade date profit is recognized if the fair value of the financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss is obtained from a quoted market price in an active market, or otherwise evidenced by comparison to other observable current market  transactions  or  based  on  a  valuation  technique  incorporating  observable  market  data.  If  there  are  significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique, the financial instrument is recognized at the transaction price and any profit implied from the valuation technique at trade date is deferred.\n\nUsing systematic methods, the deferred amount is recognized over the period between trade date and the date when the market is expected to become observable, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). Such methodology is used because it reflects the changing economic and risk profile of the instrument as the market develops or as the instrument itself progresses to maturity. Any remaining trade date deferred profit is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the transaction becomes observable.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates - Management judgment is required in determining whether there exist significant unobservable inputs in  the  valuation  technique  of  the  underlying  financial  instrument  (refer  to  section  'Determination  of  Fair  Value'  for management  judgment  required  in  establishing  fair  value  of  financial  instruments).  Once  deferred,  the  decision  to subsequently  recognize  the  trade  date  profit  requires  a  careful  assessment  of  the  then  current  facts  and  circumstances supporting observability of parameters and/or risk mitigation.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are used to manage exposures to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and other market price risks, including exposures  arising  from  forecast  transactions.  All  freestanding  contracts  that  are  considered  derivatives  for  accounting purposes are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or nontrading purposes.\n\nThe changes in fair value on derivatives held for trading are included in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nIFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of IFRS 9 hedge accounting and to continue with IAS 39 hedge accounting. The Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge accounting as of January 1, 2018. The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. Under the EU IAS 39 carve-out, fair value macro hedge accounting may be applied to core deposits and hedge ineffectiveness for all fair value macro hedge accounting applications is only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket and is not recognized when the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designated amount.\n\nFor accounting purposes the Group applies the following types of hedges:\n\n- -For hedges of changes in fair value, the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or unrecognized firm commitment, or a portion thereof, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income along with changes in the entire fair value of the derivative. When hedging interest rate risk, any interest accrued or paid on both the derivative and the hedged item is reported in interest income or expense and the unrealized gains and losses from the hedge accounting fair value adjustments are reported in other revenue. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in other revenue and is measured as the net effect of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item arising from changes in the market rate or price related to the risk(s) being hedged.\n- If  a  fair  value  hedge  of  a  debt  instrument  is  discontinued  prior  to  the  instrument's  maturity  because  the  derivative  is terminated or the relationship is de-designated, any remaining interest rate-related fair value adjustments made to the carrying amount of the debt instrument (basis adjustments) are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship. For other types of fair value adjustments and whenever a fair value hedged asset or liability is sold or otherwise derecognized, any basis adjustments are included in the calculation of the gain or loss on derecognition.",

        "page_content": "- -For hedges of variability in future cash flows, there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item and the derivative is carried at fair value, with changes in value reported initially in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective.  These  amounts  initially  recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  subsequently  reclassified  into  the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same periods during which the forecast transaction affects the Consolidated Statement of Income. Thus, for hedges of interest rate risk, the amounts are amortized into interest income or expense at the same time as the interest is accrued on the hedged transaction.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness is recorded in other income and is measured as changes in the excess (if any) in the absolute cumulative change in fair value of the actual hedging derivative over the absolute cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetically perfect hedge.\n\nWhen  hedges  of  variability  in  cash  flows  attributable  to  interest  rate  risk  are  discontinued,  amounts  remaining  in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining life of the original hedge relationship, unless the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur in which case the amount will be reclassified  into  other  income  immediately.  When  hedges  of  variability  in  cash  flows  attributable  to  other  risks  are discontinued,  the  related  amounts  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  into  either  the  same Consolidated Statement of Income caption and period as profit or loss from the forecast transaction, or into other income when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\n- -For hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of foreign operations (hedges of net investments in foreign operations) into the functional currency of the parent, the portion of the change in fair value of the derivative due to changes in the spot foreign exchange rates is recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective; the remainder is recorded as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nChanges in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are subsequently recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.\n\nHedging derivatives  are  reported  as  other  assets  and  other  liabilities.  In  the  event  that  a  derivative  is  subsequently  dedesignated from a hedging relationship, it is transferred to financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of loans and provision for off-balance sheet positions\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, and to off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. For purposes of the impairment policy below, these instruments are referred to as ('Financial Assets')\n\nThe determination of impairment losses under IFRS 9 uses an expected credit loss ('ECL') model, where allowances are taken upon initial recognition of the Financial Asset, based on expectations of potential credit losses at the time of initial recognition.\n\n## Staged approach to the determination of expected credit losses\n\nIFRS 9 states a three-stage approach to impairment for Financial Assets that are not credit-impaired at the date of origination or purchase. This approach is summarized as follows:\n\n- -Stage 1: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses for all Financial Assets. This represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 12 months of the reporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.\n- -Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for those Financial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. This requires  the  determination  of  the  ECL  based  on  lifetime  probability  of  default,  lifetime  loss  given  default  and  lifetime exposure at default that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the Financial Asset. Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk since origination or purchase and the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1.\n- -Stage 3:  The  Group  recognizes  a  loss  allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime  expected  credit  losses,  reflecting  a Probability of Default of 100%, via the expected recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those Financial Assets that are credit-impaired. The Group's definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default. Financial Assets that are credit-impaired upon initial recognition are categorized within Stage 3 with a carrying value already reflecting the lifetime expected credit losses. The accounting treatment for these purchased or originated credit-impaired ('POCI') assets is discussed further below.",

        "page_content": "ECL are calculated using three main parameters: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models combined with historical, current and forward-looking information, including macro-economic data. The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected pointin-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining expected lifetime of the financial instrument, respectively, based  on  conditions  existing  at  the  balance  sheet  date  and  future  economic  conditions  that  affect  credit  risk.  The  LGD represents expected loss conditional on default, incorporating the mitigating effect of collateral, its  expected value  when realized and the time value of money. The EAD represents the expected exposure at default, factoring in the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdown of a facility.\n\nForward-Looking Information is incorporated into the measurement of the Group Allowance for Credit Losses in terms of adjustments to multi-year PD curves based on macro-economic forecasts.\n\nThe Group's ECL model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as for Stage 3 in the homogeneous portfolio (i.e. retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). For financial assets in the bank's non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses is determined individually by credit officers.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk (i.e., risk of default) of a Financial Asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group's historical experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information (including macro-economic factors). The assessment of significant credit deterioration is key in determining when to move from measuring an allowance based on 12-month ECLs to one that is based on lifetime ECLs (i.e., transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2).\n\nThe Group's framework for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk aligns with the internal Credit Risk Management ('CRM') process and utilizes:\n\n- -Rating related indicators - based on a model that compares lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date with the lifetime PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and subsequently applies a quantile approach to determine a threshold to define the trigger point for a financial asset's transition into Stage 2; and\n- -Process  related  indicators  -  which  uses  existing  risk  management  indicators,  that  in  Management's  view  represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include obligors being added to a credit  watchlist,  being  mandatorily  transferred  to  workout  status,  payments  being  30  days  or  more  past  due  or  in forbearance.\n\nThese indicators are discussed further in section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3\n\nThe Group has aligned its definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 to when a Financial Asset has defaulted for regulatory purposes, according to the Capital Requirements Regulation under Art. 178.\n\nThe determination of whether a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and therefore in Stage 3 focusses exclusively on default risk,  without  taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of  credit  risk  mitigants  such  as  collateral  or  guarantees.  Specifically,  a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and in Stage 3 when:\n\n- -The Group considers the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group. Determination may include forbearance actions, where a concession has been granted to the borrower or economic or legal reasons that are qualitative indicators of credit impairment; or\n- -Contractual payments of either principal or interest by the obligor are past due by more than 90 days.\n\nFor Financial Assets considered to be credit-impaired, the ECL allowance covers the amount of loss the Group is expected to suffer. The estimation of ECLs is undertaken on a case-by-case basis for non-homogeneous portfolios, or by applying portfolio based parameters to individual Financial Assets in these portfolios via the Group's ECL model for homogeneous portfolios. This estimate includes the use of discounted cash flows that are adjusted for scenarios.\n\nForecasts of future economic conditions when calculating ECLs are considered. The lifetime expected losses are estimated based on the probability-weighted present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group under the contract; and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.",

        "page_content": "A Financial Asset can be classified as credit-impaired in Stage 3 but without an allowance for credit losses (i.e., no impairment loss is expected). This may be due to the value of collateral. The Group's engine based ECL calculation is conducted on a monthly basis, whereas the case-by-case assessment of ECL in Stage 3 for non-homogeneous portfolio has to be performed at least on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3\n\nA Financial Asset is considered purchased or originated credit-impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment at the time of initial recognition. Such credit-impaired Financial Assets are termed POCI Financial Assets. POCI Financial Assets are measured to reflect lifetime expected credit losses, and all subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses, whether positive or negative, are recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. POCI Financial Assets can only be classified in Stage 3 over the life of the Financial Asset.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nThe Group reduces the gross carrying amount of a Financial Asset when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Write-offs can relate to a Financial Asset in its entirety, or to a portion of it, and constitute a derecognition event. The Group considers all relevant information in making this determination, including but not limited to:\n\n- -Foreclosure actions taken by the Group which have not been successful or have a high probability of not being successful\n- -Collateral liquidation which has not, or will not lead to further considerable recoveries\n- -Situations where no further recoveries are reasonably expected\n\nWrite-offs can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded, and a write-off does not involve the Group forfeiting its legal right to recover the debt.\n\n## Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model\n\nIn the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the EIR, which is usually the contractual interest rate ('CIR') and which does not materially differ from the EIR. The CIR is deemed to be an appropriate approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the ECL.\n\n## Collateral for financial assets considered in the impairment analysis\n\nIFRS 9 requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancement to be reflected in the ECL calculation. The following are key aspects with respect to collateral and guarantees:\n\n- -Eligibility of collateral, i.e. which collateral should be considered in the ECL calculation;\n- -Collateral evaluation, i.e. what collateral (liquidation) value should be used; and\n- -Projection of the available collateral amount over the life of a transaction.\n\nThese concepts are outlined in more detail in section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - The accounting estimates and judgments related to the impairment of Financial Assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used can change from period to period and may significantly affect the Group's results of operations.\n\nIn assessing assets for impairments, management judgment is required, particularly in projecting forward looking information and scenarios in particular  in  circumstances  of  economic  and  financial  uncertainty,  when  developments  and  changes  to expected cash flows can occur both with greater rapidity and less predictability. The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ from the estimates used by management and consequently may cause actual losses to differ from reported allowances.\n\nFor  those  non-homogeneous  loans  in  Stage 3  the  determination  of  the  impairment  allowance  often  requires  the  use  of considerable judgment concerning such matters as local economic conditions, the financial performance of the counterparty and the value of any collateral held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.\n\nThe determination of the expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 and for homogeneous loans in Stage 3 is calculated using the Group's ECL model. The model incorporates numerous estimates and judgments. The Group performs a regular review of the model and underlying data and assumptions. The probability of defaults, loss recovery rates and judgments concerning ability of borrowers in foreign countries to transfer the foreign currency necessary to comply with debt repayments, amongst other  things,  are  incorporated  into  this  review.  Management  judgement  is  required  over  the  following  critical  accounting estimates:",

        "page_content": "- -Forward-Looking Information: The identification of key macro-economic variables (MEVs) reflects a balance of quantitative and qualitative judgements. Statistical analysis, including for example, back-testing and model sensitivities, are performed to assess the explanatory power of MEVs, while expert input from credit officers ensures management comfort in the overall model behavior. The final model parameterization is based on a review and challenge of impacts in internal governance forums  and  an  independent  validation  performed  by  the  Model  Risk  Management  function.  Furthermore,  conceptual soundness of the estimation approach is ensured by model testing analysis prepared as part of model changes and an ongoing monitoring framework in order for the ECL provision to reflect management's best estimate in the calculation of expected credit losses.\n- -Significant Increase in Credit Risk: In line with the section 'IFRS 9 Impairment Approach' in the Risk Report, the Group uses rating-related indicators to determine whether a financial asset's credit risk has significantly increased since inception. For financial assets in non-homogeneous portfolios the ratings are determined for every counterparty individually based on credit officer's expert judgement. For financial assets in the homogeneous portfolios (due to the large number of client relationships) the rating process is significantly automated with less judgement required by credit officers on individual counterparties. For both homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios the rating-related indicators to determine whether the credit risk for a financial asset has significantly increased are based on a model that compares lifetime PDs at the reporting date with the lifetime PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and subsequently applying a quantile approach  to  determine  a  threshold  which  defines  the  trigger  point  for  a  financial  asset's  transition  into  Stage 2.  The determination of the quantile to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined by subject matter experts in the Group's Risk function. This represents one of the key critical judgments in the Group's IFRS 9 framework and is reviewed on an annual basis based on detailed stage-mover analyses, benchmarking with historical behaviors and peer comparisons.\n- -Stage 3 Loss Given Default (LGD) Setting for Homogeneous Portfolios: The allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 is determined for the Group's homogeneous portfolios by an automated process based on partially time dependent LGDs reflecting the lower recovery expectation the longer the client is in default, thereby differentiating between secured and unsecured  exposures.  The  LGDs  are  calibrated  using  the  Group's  loss  history  built  up  over  preceding  decades, experienced market prices of non-performing portfolios sold and expert judgement. In the case of less material portfolios, the empirical calibration of the LGD is partially supported by expert credit officer judgements, especially for determining the client cure rates as one of the key inputs. The LGD settings are validated on an annual basis and are regularly reviewed by the Group's independent model validation process which is part of the Model Risk Management function.\n- -Model  adjustments:  The  Group  regularly  reviews  key  inputs  into  the  ECL  calculation  and  discusses  potential  model imprecision  to  assess  the  need  for  corrective  measures  in  the  form  of  overlays.  Overlays  are  an  essential  output  of management judgment which feeds into the model. On a quarterly basis, a senior management forum discusses the need for the recognition and/or the release of overlays. The discussion will be based on an overview of potential reasons which might require an overlay considering specific trigger points. The ultimate decision for creating overlays is jointly made by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO).\n\nThe quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 18 'Loans' and Note 19 'Allowance for credit losses' as well as the Risk Report, section 'IFRS 9 Impairment', sub-section 'Model Sensitivity'.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial asset derecognition\n\nA financial asset is considered for derecognition when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or the Group has either transferred the contractual right to receive the cash flows from that asset, or has assumed an obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more recipients, subject to certain criteria.\n\nThe Group derecognizes a transferred financial asset if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers previously recognized financial assets but retains substantially all the associated risks and rewards of those assets; for example, a sale to a third party in which the Group enters into a concurrent total return swap with the same counterparty. These types of transactions are accounted for as secured financing transactions.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

        "page_content": "Certain OTC derivative contracts and most exchange-traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing counterparties and exchanges have payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis that represents legal or economic settlement of the outstanding derivative's present value. This results in derecognition of the associated derivative financial asset and financial liabilities.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements ('reverse repurchase agreements') and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ('repurchase agreements') are treated as collateralized financings and are recognized initially at fair value, being the amount of cash disbursed and received, respectively.\n\nThe Group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under IFRS 9 and classifies them as 'Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nInterest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest income and interest expense, respectively.\n\n## Securities borrowed and securities loaned\n\nSecurities borrowed transactions generally require the Group to deposit cash with the securities lender. In a securities loaned transaction, the Group generally receives either cash collateral, in an amount equal to or in excess of the market value of securities loaned, or securities.\n\nThe securities  borrowed  are  not  themselves  recognized  in  the  financial  statements.  If  they  are  sold  to  third  parties,  the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent gain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned, respectively, in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFees received or paid are reported in interest income and interest expense, respectively. Securities lent to counterparties which are not derecognized from the Consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note 20 'Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral'.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the date of the acquisition.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This discounting is either performed using market rates or by using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests' proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (this is determined for each business combination).\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units ('CGUs'), which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and that are expected to benefit from  the  synergies  of  the  combination  and  considering  the  business  level  at  which  goodwill  is  monitored  for  internal management purposes. In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or a group of assets) are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets) various factors are considered, including how management monitors the entity's operations or makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.",

        "page_content": "If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the attributable goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal.\n\nCorporate assets are allocated to a CGU when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. If this is not possible, the individual CGU is tested without the corporate assets. They are then tested on the level of the minimum collection of CGUs to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\nIntangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer-related intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over periods of between 1 and 20 years on a straight-line basis based on their expected useful life. These assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually.\n\nCertain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\n\nCosts related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the asset's useful life which is deemed to be either three, five or ten years. Eligible costs include external direct costs for materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with an internal-use software project. Overhead costs, as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or any time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques (such as the cost approach), or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. Because these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change, the Group considers these estimates to be critical.\n\nThe quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 23 'Goodwill and other intangible assets'.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as of the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party (for example,  because  the  obligation  is  covered  by  an  insurance  policy),  an  asset  is  recognized  if  it  is  virtually  certain  that reimbursement will be received.\n\nIf  the  Group  has  a  contract  that  is  onerous,  the  present  obligation  under  the  contract  is  recognized  and  measured  as  a provision. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\nCritical accounting estimates -The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the Group's final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.\n\nContingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable  with  assurance.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  probability  and  making  estimates  in  respect  of contingencies, and the Group's final liability may ultimately be materially different. The Group's total liability in respect of litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Group's experience and the experience of others in  similar  cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Predicting the outcome of the Group's litigation matters is inherently  difficult,  particularly  in  cases  in  which  claimants  seek  substantial  or  indeterminate  damages.  See  Note 27 'Provisions' for further information on the uncertainties from the Group's judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings.",

        "page_content": "## Income taxes\n\nThe Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions' tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which those unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when (1) they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities, (2) the legally enforceable right to offset exists and (3) they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI, cash flow hedges and other items, which  are  charged  or  credited  directly  to  other  comprehensive  income,  is  also  credited  or  charged  directly  to  other comprehensive  income  and  subsequently  recognized  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  once  the  underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nFor share-based payment transactions, the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. The amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting date, the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the period. If the amount deductible, or expected to be deductible, for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense, the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity.\n\nCritical accounting estimates - In determining the amount of deferred tax assets, the Group uses historical tax capacity and profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The analysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses exists at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the pre-tax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. Each quarter, the Group re-evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. For example, tax law changes, changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made.",

        "page_content": "The use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from uncertain income tax positions. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of uncertain income tax positions, in accordance with IAS 12, 'Income Taxes' and IFRIC 23, 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment'. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the Group's final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.\n\nFor further information on the Group's income taxes (including quantitative disclosures on recognized deferred tax assets) see Note 34 'Income Taxes'.\n\n## Business combinations and noncontrolling Interests\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. At the date the Group obtains control of the subsidiary, the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, including any cash or non-cash consideration (equity instruments) transferred, any contingent consideration, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree and liabilities incurred or assumed. The excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the Group's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the aggregate of the acquisition cost and any noncontrolling interests is below the fair value of the identifiable net assets (negative goodwill), a gain is reported in other income. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nIn  business  combinations  achieved  in  stages  ('step  acquisitions'),  a  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  is remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts recognized  in  prior  periods  in  other  comprehensive  income  associated  with  the  previously  held  investment  would  be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity, which is distinct from the Group's shareholders' equity. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result in a change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid-in capital ('APIC').\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nIndividual non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their  present  condition  subject  only  to  the  customary  sales  terms  of  such  assets  (and  disposal  groups)  and  their  sale  is considered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore, the assets (and disposal groups) must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected to be completed within one year. Non-current non-financial assets (and disposal groups) which meet the criteria for held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented within 'Other assets' and 'Other liabilities' in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9. The comparatives are not represented when non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty  and  equipment  includes  own-use  properties,  leasehold  improvements,  furniture  and  equipment  and  software (operating  systems  only).  Right-of-use  assets  are  presented  together  with  property  and  equipment  on  the  Group's consolidated  balance  sheet.  Own-use  properties  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is generally recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of estimated useful lives is 25 to 50 years for property and 3 to 10 years for furniture and equipment (including  initial  improvements  to  purchased  buildings).  Leasehold  improvements  are  capitalized  and  subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement, which generally ranges from 3 to 25 years. Depreciation of property and equipment is included in general and administrative expenses. Maintenance and repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. Gains and losses on disposals are included in other income.\n\nProperty and equipment are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. After the recognition of impairment of an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.",

        "page_content": "## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.\n\n## Financial guarantees written\n\nThe Group has chosen to apply the fair value option to certain written financial guarantees that are managed on a fair value basis. Financial guarantees that the Group has not designated at fair value are initially recognized at fair value on the date the guarantee is given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group's liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of the amount initially recognized, less cumulative amortization, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are determined by management based on experience with similar transactions and history of past losses.\n\nAny increase in the liability relating to guarantees is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in provision for credit losses.\n\n## Financial guarantees purchased\n\nPurchased financial guarantees result in reimbursements under IAS 37 to the extent that the financial guarantee is entered into to mitigate the credit exposure from debt instruments with HTC or HTC&S business models. This results in recognition of a reimbursement asset for subsequent increases in the expected credit losses, to the extent it is virtually certain that the purchased financial guarantee will reimburse the Group for the loss incurred. Accordingly, when the credit risk of the borrower significantly deteriorates a reimbursement asset is recognized equal to the life-time expected credit losses and is presented as Other Assets in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The corresponding reimbursement gain is recognized as a reduction in the Provision for credit losses in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments allocated to HTC or HTC&S business models may also be embedded in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO's) issued by the Group. Such embedded guarantees are not accounted for separately as a reimbursement asset and are instead accounted as part of the CLO's liability held at amortized cost. The Group regularly revises its estimated contractual redemption payment (including the benefit of such embedded guarantees) from the CLO when the credit risk of a borrower covered by the embedded financial guarantee in the CLO significantly deteriorates. The revision is based on the life-time expected credit losses of the debt instrument (to the extent covered by the CLO).\n\nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments included in the Other business model are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Leasing transactions\n\nThe Group enters into lease contracts, predominantly for land and buildings, as a lessee. Other categories are company cars and technical/IT equipment.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments).\n\nRight-of-use assets are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the fair value less costs of disposal, must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. As right-of-use assets do not have independently generated cash flows to calculate its value in use, the Group considers any sublease income that could reasonably be earned. After the recognition of impairment of an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.",

It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of technical/IT equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension benefits\n\nThe Group provides a number of pension plans. In addition to defined contribution plans, there are retirement benefit plans accounted for as defined benefit plans. The assets of all the Group's defined contribution plans are held in independently administered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on employee services rendered, generally in the year of contribution.\n\nAll  retirement  benefit  plans  accounted  for  as  defined  benefit  plans  are  valued  using  the  projected  unit-credit  method  to determine  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  and  the  related  service  costs.  Under  this  method,  the determination is based on actuarial calculations which include assumptions about demographics, salary increases and interest and inflation rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the period in which they occur. The majority of the Group's benefit plans is funded.\n\nFor the Group's most significant pension plans in the key countries, the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve - derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party index data providers and rating agencies - reflecting the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective plan.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nIn addition, the Group maintains unfunded contributory post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. The Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are due. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income and presented in equity.\n\nRefer to Note 33 'Employee benefits' for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits arise when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognizes termination benefits as a liability  and  an  expense  if  the  Group  is  demonstrably  committed  to  a  detailed  formal  plan  without  realistic  possibility  of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nCompensation expense for awards classified as equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the share-based award. For share awards, the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect, if any, of restrictions beyond the vesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value immediately prior to modification, a remeasurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is recognized as additional compensation expense.",

Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are periodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating to grants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service period are accelerated by shortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria  for  the  award, and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately.\n\nCompensation expense for share-based awards payable in cash is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and recognized over the vesting period in which the related employee services are rendered. The related obligations are included in other liabilities until paid.\n\n## Other deferred compensation plans\n\nCompensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. The amount recognized is based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the respective plan and is remeasured at each reporting date. The ultimate cumulative compensation expense recognized equals the cash or the fair value of the respective financial instruments delivered.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nThe Group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant and will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. The benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is intended to compensate the Group for related costs and presented as a reduction of the related expense.\n\nThe Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-market loan under IAS 20 and recognized subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS 9. Since November 23, 2022, all remaining TLTRO III operations are indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates.\n\nFor further information on the benefit recognized by the Group from the TLTRO III refinancing program see Note 5 'Net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\n## Options and forwards on common shares\n\nOption and forward contracts on Deutsche Bank shares are classified as equity if the number of shares is fixed and physical settlement is required.

Such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks.\n\nThere are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the  Group.  Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's assignment of cash flows to the operating, investing or financing category depends on the business model ('management approach'). For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. Therefore, the issuance and management of long-term borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a nonfinancial company, where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category.\n\nThe Group views the issuance of senior long-term debt as an operating activity. Senior long-term debt comprises structured notes and asset-backed securities, which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business line  segments  and  which  are  revenue  generating  activities.  The  other  component  is  debt  issued  by  Treasury,  which  is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability.\n\nCash flows related to subordinated long-term debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to senior-long term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Group's capital, primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result, they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities, but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category.\n\nThe amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude non-cash items such as movements due to foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies.\n\nMovements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows.",

IFRS 17 replaced IFRS 4 which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting for insurance contracts using national accounting standards, resulting in a multitude of different approaches. IFRS 17 solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner, benefiting both investors and insurance companies. Insurance obligations will be accounted for using current values - instead of historical cost. The information will be updated regularly, providing more useful information to users of financial statements. Based on the Group's current business activities IFRS 17 did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the Group does not provide the transition related disclosures under IFRS 17.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Group also adopted amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' that (1) addressed concerns and implementation challenges that were identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017 and (2) narrow-scope amendments to the transition  requirements  of  IFRS  17  for  entities  that  first  apply  IFRS  17  and  IFRS  9  at  the  same  time.  Neither  of  these amendments had a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IAS 12 'Income Taxes'\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes'. These amendments changed the deferred tax treatment related to assets and liabilities in a single transaction such that they introduce an exemption from the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24. Accordingly, the initial recognition exemption does not apply to  transactions  in  which  both  deductible  and  taxable  temporary  differences  arise  on  initial  recognition  that  result  in  the recognition of equal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Neither of these amendments had a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued Global Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Rules under the Pillar 2 Framework. In May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' to introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of Pillar 2  model  rules  and  disclosure  requirements.  The  application  of  the  exception  outlined  above  had  to  be  applied immediately with the disclosure requirements to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The mandatory  temporary  exception  has  been  applied  and  there  has  been  no  impact  on  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements'\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 1 and 'IFRS Practice Statement 2' that are intended to provide guidance on deciding which accounting policies to disclose in financial statements. Accordingly, an entity is now required to disclose its material accounting policies instead of its significant accounting policies. The amendments did not have an impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## New accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following accounting pronouncements were not effective as of December 31, 2023 and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 16 'Leases'\n\nIn September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases' that clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the IFRS 15 requirements to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements'\n\nIn January 2020 and July 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current'. The amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that the classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. They will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn October 2022, the IASB issued a further amendment to IAS 1 that modifies the requirements described above on how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstances. Accordingly, it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In line with the previous amendments, the new amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates'\n\nIn August 2023, the IASB issued 'Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)' that contains guidance to specify when a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. It also requires the disclosure of additional information when a currency is not exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. These amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.",

Numis is a leading corporate broking and advisory house in the United Kingdom, providing strategic  advice  and  capital  market  connectivity  to  more  than 170  corporate  broking  clients,  including 64 clients  in  the FTSE 350, representing almost 20% of the index.\n\nOn October 13, 2023, the acquisition was completed and Deutsche Bank acquired a 100% interest in Numis for a cash purchase price of \u20ac 460 million (GBP 397 million).\n\nThe intention to acquire Numis aims to establish a prominent position across UK corporate broking and strategic advisory to allow Deutsche Bank to accelerate its Global Hausbank strategy by unlocking a much deeper engagement with corporate clients in the UK. The combination of Deutsche Bank's UK and Ireland corporate finance business with Numis will be known under the new brand, Deutsche Numis.\n\nFollowing  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date has been finalized in the fourth quarter 2023 with details included in the table below. The fair  value  of  acquired  receivables  equal  gross  contractual  amounts  which  all  relate  to  short  term  trading  activity.  Other intangible  assets  identified  in  the  purchase  price  allocation  include  customer  relationships  (\u20ac 56 million)  and  tradename (\u20ac 27 million).  Goodwill  of  \u20ac 235 million  identified  in  the  purchase  price  allocation  mainly  represent  the  expected  future economic benefit of synergies and the value of human capital.\n\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed as of the Acquisition Date\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                       | October 13,  2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Cash consideration transferred                                                | 460                 |\n| Total consideration transferred                                               | 460                 |\n| Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 1 |                     |\n| Interbank balances (w/o central banks)                                        | 126                 |\n| Securities borrowed                                                           | 10                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                         | 44                  |\n| Property and equipment                                                        | 53                  |\n| Other intangible assets                                                       | 84                  |\n| All other assets                                                              | 410                 |\n| Total assets acquired                                                         | 727                 |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                    | 14                  |\n| All other liabilities                                                         | 488                 |\n| Total liabilities assumed                                                     | 502                 |\n| Total identifiable net assets                                                 | 225                 |\n| Goodwill                                                                      | 235                 |\n| Total identifiable net assets and goodwill acquired                           | 460                 |\n\nDeutsche Bank has assigned goodwill resulting from the Numis acquisition to the Investment Bank cash-generating unit (CGU). Given the valuation of the Investment Bank CGU, following the acquisition, goodwill recognized for Numis is considered impaired and was written off in the fourth quarter of 2023 (also refer to Note 23 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets).\n\nFrom the date of acquisition, Numis contributed \u20ac 31 million of revenues and a \u20ac 1 million net loss after tax to the Group results. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group's revenues including Numis would have been \u20ac 29.0 billion and profit after tax would have been \u20ac 4.9 billion.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group did not undertake any acquisitions accounted for as business combinations.\n\nIn the third quarter 2021, the Group had completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Better Payment Germany GmbH, a Berlin-based early-stage payment service provider. Through this acquisition, the Group intended to expand its market share in payment processing and acceptance. The fair value of the purchase price paid for the acquisition consisted of \u20ac 5 million cash and an earn-out consideration of \u20ac 3 million contingent upon a number of KPIs to be achieved within 3 years following the acquisition. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Group recorded goodwill of \u20ac 5 million assigned to the Corporate Bank CGU. Given the value of the Corporate Bank CGU, the new goodwill was considered impaired and immediately written off in 2021.",

Within International Private Bank revenues are reported in the categories Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs and Premium Banking. By year end 2022, International Private Bank materially completed the wind-down of the majority of legacy assets and liabilities associated with Sal. Oppenheim. Remaining assets or liabilities are not expected to have material financial impacts going forward and will be included in the normal course of the client segment Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs. The associated disclosure of 'specific revenues items' was discontinued starting in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAsset Management reports revenues in the categories Management Fees, Performance and Transaction Fees and Other.\n\nCorporate & Other includes revenues, costs and resources held centrally that are not allocated to the individual business segments as well as valuation and timing differences that arise on derivatives used to hedge the Group's balance sheet. These are accounting impacts, and valuation losses are expected to be recovered over time as the underlying instruments approach maturity. In addition, Corporate & Other contains financial impacts of legacy portfolios, previously reported as the Capital Release Unit.\n\nAs announced in the Annual Report 2022, having fulfilled the Capital Release Unit's de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through year end 2022, the Capital Release Unit ceased to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of 2023. The remaining portfolio, resources and employees are reported within the Corporate & Other segment. In line with the change, the Core Bank, which previously represented the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit, ceased to be reported as of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn addition, based on management decisions during the reporting period further divisional changes were introduced.\n\nThe prior years' segmental information is presented in the current structure.\n\n## Measurement of segment profit or loss\n\nSegment reporting requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods, including a reconciliation between the results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements, which is presented in the 'Segment results of operations' section within this note. The information provided about each segment is based on internal management reporting about segment profit or loss, assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.",

        "page_content": "Segment assets are presented in the Group's internal management reporting based on a consolidated view, i.e., the amounts do not include intersegment balances. The Group's internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly, depreciation and amortization, tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here.\n\nNon-IFRS  compliant  accounting  methods  used  in  the  Group's  management  reporting  represent  either  valuation  or classification  differences.  The  largest  valuation  differences  relate  to  measurement  at  fair  value  in  management  reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management  reporting  (in  Investment  Bank)  and  in  equity  under  IFRS.  The  major  classification  difference  relates  to noncontrolling  interest,  which  represents  the  net  share  of  minority  shareholders  in  revenues,  provision  for  credit  losses, noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the businesses in management reporting (with a reversal in Corporate & Other) and a component of net income appropriation under IFRS.\n\nSince the Group's business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated, certain estimates and judgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments.\n\nThe management reporting systems allocate the Group's external  net interest  income  according  to  the  value  of  funding consumed or provided by each business segment's activities, in accordance with the bank's internal funds transfer pricing framework. Furthermore, to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding, the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital, in line with each segment's proportion of average shareholders' equity.\n\nManagement uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Group's businesses and to enable them to better understand the Group's results.\n\n## Allocation of Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nShareholders' equity is fully allocated to the Group's segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. Regulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each segment to the Groups' Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, the Groups' leverage ratio and the Group's capital loss under stress. Contributions in each of the three dimensions are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the Group. Contributions to the CET1 ratio and the leverage ratio are measured through risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. The Group's capital loss under stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill and other intangible assets are directly attributed to the Group's segments in order to allow the determination of allocated tangible shareholders' equity and the respective returns. Shareholders' equity and tangible shareholders' equity is allocated on a monthly basis and averaged across quarters and for the full year.\n\n## Driver-Based Cost Management allocations methodology change\n\nAs disclosed in the Annual Report 2022, the Group implemented the Driver-Based Cost Management allocations from the first quarter of 2023. The new methodology aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links costs more closely to service consumption by segments. This change did not affect the Group's cost/income ratio and return on tangible equity metrics but does impact these per business segment. Therefore prior-period information is presented in the current structure, resulting in an increase in noninterest expenses (corresponding decrease in profit before tax) for Corporate Bank  of  \u20ac 276 million,  for  Investment  Bank  of  \u20ac 239 million,  for  Private  Bank  of  \u20ac 279 million,  for  Asset  Management  of \u20ac 15 million, with a corresponding decrease in noninterest expenses (corresponding reduction in loss before tax) for Corporate & Other of \u20ac 809 million for the full year 2022.\n\n## Strategic Liquidity Reserve Profit and Loss Allocation\n\nCommencing from the first quarter of 2022, the methodology for divisional intra-year allocations of profit or loss earned on the Strategic Liquidity Reserves has been refined. As part of the introduction of the new methodology, the intra-year profit and loss  volatility  is  held  centrally  in  Corporate  &  Other  in  order  to  better  reflect  the  underlying  performance  of  the  business divisions. The implementation of the new methodology does not impact the overall group revenues or the annual business allocations, therefore the full year results for 2022 and 2021 are not impacted.",

This enables management to measure performance of taxable and tax-exempt securities on a comparable basis. This presentation resulted in an increase in Investment Bank net interest income of \u20ac 10 million for full year 2023, \u20ac 33 million for full year 2022 and \u20ac 40 million for full year 2021. This increase is offset in Group consolidated figures through a reversal in Corporate & Other. The tax rate used in determining the fully taxable-equivalent of net interest income in respect of the majority of the U.S. tax-exempt securities is 21% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Infrastructure Full-time Employees realignment\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, approximately 9,000 FTEs moved from Corporate & Other to the operating business segments driven  by  the  bank's  decision  that  the  Chief  Operating  Office  will  no  longer  be  a  separate  Management  Board  function. Accordingly, business-related parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank, which were previously run in Infrastructure, moved to those divisions. Comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level, as costs are allocated from Corporate & Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to Corporate & Other.\n\n## Segmental results of operations\n\nThe

meaningful\n\nPrior year's comparatives aligned to presentation in the current year\n\n- 2 Segment assets are presented on a consolidated basis, i.e., the amounts do not include intersegment balances\n- 3 The Group defines assets under management as (a) assets held on behalf of customers for investment purposes and/or (b) client assets that are managed by the bank; assets under management are managed on a discretionary or advisory basis, or these assets are deposited with the bank; deposits are considered assets under management if they serve  investment  purposes;  in  the  Private  Bank  Germany  and  Premium  Banking,  this  includes  term  deposits  and  savings  deposits;  in  Wealth  Management  &  Bank  for Entrepreneurs, it is assumed that all customer deposits are held with the bank primarily for investment purposes; in instances in which Private Bank distributes investment products qualifying as assets under management which are managed by DWS these are reported as assets under management for Private Bank and for Asset Management (DWS) because they are two distinct, independent qualifying services\n- 4 Noninterest expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, which are defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses plus noninterest income\n- 5 For the post-tax return on average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity of the segments, the Group effective tax rate was adjusted to exclude the impact of permanent differences not attributed to the segments, so that the segment tax rates were 28% for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021; for further information, please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this report",

amounts do not include intersegment balances\n- 3 The Group defines assets under management as (a) assets held on behalf of customers for investment purposes and/or (b) client assets that are managed by the bank; assets under management are managed on a discretionary or advisory basis, or these assets are deposited with the bank; deposits are considered assets under management if they serve  investment  purposes;  in  the  Private  Bank  Germany  and  Premium  Banking,  this  includes  term  deposits  and  savings  deposits;  in  Wealth  Management  &  Bank  for Entrepreneurs, it is assumed that all customer deposits are held with the bank primarily for investment purposes; in instances in which Private Bank distributes investment products qualifying as assets under management which are managed by DWS these are reported as assets under management for Private Bank and for Asset Management (DWS) because they are two distinct, independent qualifying services\n- 4 Noninterest expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, which are defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses plus noninterest income\n- 5 For the post-tax return on average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity of the segments, the Group effective tax rate was adjusted to exclude the impact of permanent differences not attributed to the segments, so that the segment tax rates were 28% for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021; for further information, please refer to 'Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures' of this

The Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-market loan under IAS 20 and recognizes subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS 9. The current interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III operations is indexed on the average applicable key ECB interest rates from November  23,  2022,  onward.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  has  borrowed  \u20ac 15.0 billion  (December  31,  2022: \u20ac 33.7 billion) under the TLTRO III-refinancing program. The resulting net interest income (expense) includes \u20ac (741) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 211 million) under the TLTRO III program.",

Under IFRS, interest and similar income earned from trading instruments and financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., coupon and dividend income), and the costs of funding net trading positions, are part of net interest income. The Group's trading activities can periodically shift income to either net interest income or to net gains (losses)  of  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  depending  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  risk management strategies.

As of 31 December 2023, there were performance obligations to be satisfied of \u20ac 225 million with a time band of three years from 2025 to 2027 (as of 31 December 2022, \u20ac 267 million with a time band of three years from 2024 to 2026) from Alternative funds. The decrease of performance obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by decline in the real estate valuations due to market conditions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Group's balance of receivables from commission and fee income was \u20ac 903 million  and  \u20ac 798 million  respectively.  As  of  December 31,  2023,  and  December 31,  2022,  the  Group's  balance  of contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was \u20ac 90 million and \u20ac 63 million, respectively. Contract liabilities arise from the Group's obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. As a result, prior period balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. Customer payment in exchange for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period such that the Group's right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully completed. Therefore, no material balance of contract asset is reported.",

The average number of common shares outstanding is defined as the average number of common shares issued, reduced by the average number of shares in treasury and by the average  number  of  shares  that  will  be  acquired  under  physically-settled  forward  purchase  contracts,  and  increased  by undistributed vested shares awarded under deferred share plans.\n\nDiluted earnings per share assumes the conversion into common shares of outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common  stock,  such  as  share  options,  convertible  debt,  unvested  deferred  share  awards  and  forward  contracts.

Lending facilities consist of drawn loan assets and undrawn irrevocable loan commitments. The maximum exposure to credit risk on a drawn loan is its fair value. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk on drawn loans was \u20ac 75 million and \u20ac 168 million as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Exposure to credit risk also exists for undrawn irrevocable loan commitments and is predominantly counterparty credit risk.\n\nThe credit risk on the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed designated under the fair value option is mitigated by the holding of collateral. The valuation of these instruments considers the credit enhancement in the form of the collateral received.

Valuation techniques used for financial instruments include modelling techniques, the use of indicative quotes for proxy instruments, quotes from recent and less regular transactions and broker quotes.\n\nFor some financial instruments a rate or other parameter, rather than a price, is quoted. Where this is the case then the market rate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determine fair value. For some instruments, modelling techniques follow  industry  standard  models,  for  example,  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  standard  option  pricing  models.  These models are dependent upon estimated future cash flows, discount factors and volatility levels. For more complex or unique instruments,  more  sophisticated  modelling  techniques  are  required,  and  may  rely  upon  assumptions  or  more  complex parameters such as correlations, prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity.\n\nFrequently, valuation models require multiple parameter inputs. Where possible, parameter inputs are based on observable data or are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. Where observable data is not available for  parameter inputs, then other market information is considered. For example, indicative broker quotes and consensus pricing  information  are  used  to  support  parameter  inputs  where  they  are  available.  Where  no  observable  information  is available to support parameter inputs then they are based on other relevant sources of information such as prices for similar transactions, historic data, economic fundamentals, and research information, with appropriate adjustment to reflect the terms of the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions.\n\nValuation Adjustments - Valuation adjustments are an integral part of the valuation process. In making appropriate valuation adjustments, the Group follows methodologies that consider factors such as bid-offer spreads, counterparty/own credit and funding risk. Bid offer spread valuation adjustments are required to adjust mid-market valuations to the appropriate bid or offer valuation. The bid or offer valuation is the best representation of the fair value for an instrument. The carrying value of a long position is adjusted from mid to bid, and the carrying value of a short position is adjusted from mid to offer. Bid-offer valuation adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and in quotes from other broker-dealers or other knowledgeable counterparties. Where the quoted price for the instrument is already a bid-offer price then no additional bid-offer valuation adjustment is necessary. Where the fair value of financial instruments is derived from a modelling technique, then the parameter inputs into that model are normally at a mid-market level. Such instruments are generally managed on a portfolio basis and, when specified criteria are met, valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the cost of closing out the net exposure the Bank has to individual market or counterparty risks. These adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and quotes from other broker-dealers.\n\nWhere complex valuation models are used, or where less-liquid positions are being valued, then bid-offer levels for those positions may not be available directly from the market, and therefore for the close-out cost of these positions, models and parameters  must  be  estimated.  When  these  adjustments  are  designed,  the  Group  closely  examines  the  valuation  risks associated with the model as well as the positions themselves, and the resulting adjustments are closely monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nCounterparty Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) are required to cover expected credit losses to the extent that the valuation technique does not already include an expected credit loss factor relating to the non-performance risk of the counterparty. The CVA amount is applied to all relevant over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the probability of default, based on available market information, including Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxies are used.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., OTC derivative liabilities and issued note liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) incorporates valuation adjustments to measure the change in the Group's own credit risk (i.e. Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) for Derivatives and Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) for issued note liabilities). Issued note liabilities are discounted utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be traded as at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset. The change in this own credit component is reported under Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).",

        "page_content": "For derivative liabilities the Group considers its own creditworthiness by assessing all counterparties expected future exposure to the Group, taking into account any collateral posted by the Group, the effect of relevant netting arrangements, the market price  of  the  Group's  issued  note  liabilities,  the  market  implied  funding  costs  and  the  seniority  of  derivative  claims  under resolution (statutory subordination).\n\nWhen determining CVA and DVA, additional adjustments are made where appropriate to achieve fair value, due to the expected loss estimate of a particular arrangement, or where the credit risk being assessed differs in nature to that described by the available CDS instrument.\n\nFunding Valuation Adjustments (FVA) are required to incorporate the market implied funding costs into the fair value of derivative positions. The FVA reflects a discounting spread applied to uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives and is determined by assessing the market-implied funding costs on both assets and liabilities.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty in the assumptions used within a modelling technique, an additional adjustment is taken to calibrate the model price to the expected market price of the financial instrument. Typically, such transactions have bid-offer levels which are less observable, and these adjustments aim to estimate the bid-offer by computing the liquidity-premium associated with the transaction. Where a financial instrument is of sufficient complexity that the cost of closing it out would be higher than the cost of closing out its component risks, then an additional adjustment is taken to reflect this.\n\nThe Group uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Where relevant, these assumptions may include assumptions about climate change. The Group has not made material adjustment to fair value for climate change beyond that already priced into market inputs.\n\nValuation Control - The Group has an independent specialized valuation control group within the Risk function which governs and develops the valuation control framework and manages the valuation control processes. The mandate of this specialist function includes the performance of the independent valuation control process for all businesses, the continued development of  valuation  control  methodologies and techniques, as well as devising and governing the formal valuation control policy framework. Special attention of this independent valuation control group is directed to areas where management judgment forms part of the valuation process.\n\nResults of the valuation control process are collected and analyzed as part of a standard monthly reporting cycle. Variances of differences outside of preset and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the Finance function and with Senior Business Management for review, resolution and, if required, adjustment.\n\nFor instruments where fair value is determined from valuation models, the assumptions and techniques used within the models are independently validated by an independent specialist model validation group that is part of the Group's Risk Management function.\n\nQuotes for transactions and parameter inputs are obtained from a number of third party sources including exchanges, pricing service providers, firm broker quotes and consensus pricing services. Price sources are examined and assessed to determine the quality of fair value information they represent, with greater emphasis given to those possessing greater valuation certainty and  relevance.  The  results  are  compared  against  actual  transactions  in  the  market  to  ensure  the  model  valuations  are calibrated to market prices.\n\nPrice and parameter inputs to models, assumptions and valuation adjustments are verified against independent sources. Where they cannot be verified to independent sources due to lack of observable information, the estimate of fair value is subject to procedures to assess its reasonableness. Such procedures include performing revaluation using independently generated  models  (including  where  existing  models  are  independently  recalibrated),  assessing  the  valuations  against appropriate proxy instruments and other benchmarks, and performing extrapolation techniques. Assessment is made as to whether the valuation techniques produce fair value estimates that are reflective of market levels by calibrating the results of the valuation models against market transactions where possible.",

        "page_content": "## Valuation techniques\n\nThe Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, methodologies, valuation techniques and procedures over the valuation process and fair value measurement. The current market conditions including the ongoing macro-economic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties required additional focus and review in certain areas, during the year 2023 including assessment of bid-offer spreads to ensure they are representative of fair value.\n\nThe following is an explanation of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different types of financial instruments that the Group trades.\n\nSovereign, Quasi-sovereign and Corporate Debt and Equity Securities - Where there are no recent transactions then fair value may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that date. Where a close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determined by adjusting the proxy value for differences in the risk profile of the instruments. Where close proxies are not available then fair value is estimated using more complex modelling techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models using current market rates for credit, interest, liquidity and other risks. For equity securities modeling techniques may also include those based on earnings multiples.\n\nMortgage- and Other Asset-Backed Securities (MBS/ABS) include residential and commercial MBS and other ABS including Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO). ABS have specific characteristics as they have different underlying assets, and the issuing entities have different capital structures. The complexity increases further where the underlying assets are themselves ABS, as is the case with many of the CDO instruments.\n\nWhere no reliable external pricing is available, ABS are valued, where applicable, using either relative value analysis which is performed based on similar transactions observable in the market, or industry-standard valuation models making largest possible use of available observable inputs. The industry standard models calculate principal and interest payments for a given  deal  based  on  assumptions  that  can  be  independently  price  tested.  The  inputs  include  prepayment  speeds,  loss assumptions (timing and severity) and a discount rate (spread, yield  or  discount  margin).  These  inputs/assumptions  are derived from actual transactions, external market research and market indices where appropriate.\n\nLoans - For certain loans fair value may be determined from the market price on a recently occurring transaction adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that transaction date. Where there are no recent market transactions then broker quotes, consensus pricing, proxy instruments or discounted cash flow models are used to determine fair value. Discounted cash flow models incorporate parameter inputs for credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, loss given default estimates  and  amounts  utilized  given  default,  as  appropriate.  Credit  risk,  loss  given  default  and  utilization  given  default parameters are determined using information from the loan or CDS markets, where available and appropriate.\n\nLeveraged loans can have transaction-specific characteristics which can limit the relevance of market-observed transactions. Where similar transactions exist for which observable quotes are available from external pricing services then this information is used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the transaction differences. When no similar transactions exist, a discounted cash flow valuation technique is used with credit spreads derived from the appropriate leveraged loan index, incorporating the industry classification, subordination of the loan, and any other relevant information on the loan and loan counterparty.\n\nOver-The-Counter Derivative Financial Instruments - Market standard transactions in liquid trading markets, such as interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward and option contracts in G7 currencies, and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities or indices are valued using market standard models and quoted parameter inputs. Parameter inputs are obtained from pricing services, consensus pricing services and recently occurring transactions in active markets wherever possible.\n\nMore complex instruments are modeled using more sophisticated modeling techniques specific for the instrument and are calibrated to available market prices. Where the model output value does not calibrate to a relevant market reference then valuation adjustments are made to the model output value to adjust for any difference. In less active markets, data is obtained from  less  frequent  market  transactions,  broker  quotes  and  through  extrapolation  and  interpolation  techniques.  Where observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions.",

        "page_content": "Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss under the Fair Value Option - The fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option incorporates all market risk factors including a measure of the Group's credit risk relevant for that financial liability (i.e., own credit adjustment (OCA) for structured notes). Under IFRS 9, the own credit component of change in the fair value is reported under Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Financial  liabilities  included  in  this  classification  are  structured  note  issuances,  structured  deposits,  and  other  structured securities  issued  by  consolidated  vehicles.  The  fair  value  of  these  financial  liabilities  is  determined  by  discounting  the contractual cash flows using the relevant credit-adjusted yield curve (i.e., utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be traded as at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset).\n\nWhere the financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option are collateralized, such as  securities  loaned  and  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements,  the  credit  enhancement  is  factored  into  the  fair valuation of the liability.\n\nInvestment Contract Liabilities - Assets which are linked to the investment contract liabilities are owned by the Group. The investment contract obliges the Group to use these assets to settle these liabilities. Therefore, the fair value of investment contract liabilities is determined by the fair value of the underlying assets (i.e., amount payable on surrender of the policies).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe financial instruments carried at fair value have been categorized under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Instruments valued using quoted prices in active markets are instruments where the fair value can be determined directly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets.\n\nThese include: government bonds, exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities traded on active, liquid exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 - Instruments valued with valuation techniques using observable market data are instruments where the fair value can be determined by reference to similar instruments trading in active markets, or where a technique is used to derive the valuation but where all significant inputs to that technique are observable.\n\nThese include: many OTC derivatives, many investment-grade listed credit bonds, some CDS.\n\nLevel 3 - Instruments valued using valuation techniques using market data which is not directly observable are instruments where the fair value cannot be determined directly by reference to market-observable information, and some other pricing technique must be employed. Instruments classified in this category have an input to that technique which is unobservable, and which can have a significant impact on the fair value.\n\nThese  include:  more-complex  OTC  derivatives,  distressed  debt,  highly-structured  bonds,  illiquid  asset-backed  securities (ABS), illiquid CDO's (cash and synthetic), some private equity placements, many commercial real estate (CRE) loans, illiquid loans, and some municipal bonds.",

liabilities; along with transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of \u20ac 11 billion in assets and \u20ac 3 billion in liabilities. The assessment of Level 1 versus Level 2 is based on liquidity testing procedures.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments with fair value derived from valuation techniques containing significant unobservable parameters (Level 3)\n\nSome of the financial assets and financial liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have identical or similar offsetting exposures to the unobservable input. However, according to IFRS they are required to be presented gross.\n\nTrading  Securities  -  Certain  illiquid  emerging  market  corporate  bonds  and  illiquid  highly  structured  corporate  bonds  are included in this level of the hierarchy. In addition, some of the holdings of notes issued by securitization entities, commercial and residential MBS, collateralized debt obligation securities and other ABS are reported here. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances, gains and net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by sales and settlements.",

        "page_content": "Positive and Negative Market Values from Derivative Instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The unobservable parameters may include certain correlations, certain longer-term volatilities, certain prepayment rates, credit spreads and other transaction-specific parameters.\n\nLevel 3 derivatives include certain options where the volatility is unobservable; certain basket options in which the correlations between  the  referenced  underlying  assets  are  unobservable;  longer-term  interest  rate  option  derivatives;  multi-currency foreign exchange derivatives; and certain credit default swaps for which the credit spread is not observable.\n\nThe decrease in assets during the period are driven by net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements, partially offset by gains. The decrease in liabilities during the period are driven by net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements, partially offset by losses.\n\nOther Trading Instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy mainly consist of traded loans valued using valuation models based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances, net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and gains partially offset by sales and settlements.\n\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss classified in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy include any non-trading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models. This includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset that  falls  into  the  Hold  to  Collect  or  Hold  to  Collect  and  Sell  business  models  for  which  the  contractual  cash  flow characteristics are not SPPI. The decrease in the period is driven by settlements and sales, net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and losses, partially offset by purchases and issuances.\n\nFinancial Assets/Liabilities designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss - Certain corporate loans and structured liabilities which were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option were categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy. The corporate loans are valued using valuation techniques which incorporate observable credit spreads, recovery rates and unobservable utilization parameters. Revolving loan facilities are reported in the third level of the hierarchy because the utilization in the event of the default parameter is significant and unobservable.\n\nIn addition, certain hybrid debt issuances designated at fair value through profit or loss containing embedded derivatives are valued  based  on  significant  unobservable  parameters.  These  unobservable  parameters  include  single  stock  volatility correlations. The decrease in assets during the period is driven by settlements. The increase in liabilities during the period is driven by issuances and losses partially offset by net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include non-performing loan portfolios where there is no trading intent, and the market is very illiquid. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances, partially offset by sales and settlements, net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and losses.",

cash amount received on the issuance of a liability and the cash amount paid on the primary issuance of a loan to a borrower\n- 3 Settlements represent cash flows to settle the asset or liability. For debt and loan instruments this includes principal on maturity, principal amortizations and principal repayments. For derivatives all cash flows are presented in settlements\n- 4 Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 are related to changes in observability of input parameters. During the year they are recorded at their fair value at the beginning of year. For instruments transferred into Level 3 the table shows the gains and losses and cash flows on the instruments as if they had been transferred at the beginning of the year. Similarly, for instruments transferred out of Level 3 the table does not show any gains or losses or cash flows on the instruments during the year since the table is presented as if they have been transferred out at the beginning of the year\n- 5 Total gains and losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include a loss of \u20ac 17 million recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax and a loss of \u20ac 3 million recognized in the income statement presented in net gains (losses)\n- 6 This amount includes the effect of exchange rate changes. For total financial assets held at fair value this effect is a loss of \u20ac 273 million and for total financial liabilities held at fair value this is a gain of \u20ac 44 million\n- 7 For assets positive balances represent gains, negative balances represent losses. For liabilities positive balances represent losses, negative balances represent gains",

financial  instruments  is  dependent  on  unobservable  parameter  inputs,  the  precise  level  for  these parameters at the balance sheet date might be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In preparing the financial statements, appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and in line with the Group's approach to valuation control detailed above.\n\nThe Group's sensitivity calculation of unobservable parameters for Level 3 aligns to the approach used to assess valuation uncertainty for prudent valuation purposes. Prudent valuation is a capital requirement for assets held at fair value. It provides a mechanism for quantifying and capitalizing valuation uncertainty in accordance with the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101, which supplements Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No. 2019/876 (CRR), requiring institutions to apply the requirements of Article 105 (14) to all assets measured at fair value and to deduct any additional value adjustments from CET1 capital. This utilizes an exit price analysis performed for the relevant assets and liabilities in the Prudent Valuation assessment.",

As of December 31, 2022 it could have increased fair value by as much as \u20ac 2.0 billion or decreased fair value by as much as \u20ac 1.4 billion.\n\nThe changes in sensitive amounts from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 were a reduction in positive fair value movement of \u20ac 169 million, and a reduction in negative fair value movement of \u20ac 79 million.\n\nThe reductions in positive and negative fair value movements are directionally aligned with the reduction in Group Level 3 in the period, with Level 3 assets moving from \u20ac 26.7 billion at December 31, 2022 to \u20ac 25.6 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe change in positive fair value movements from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 represents an 9% reduction and the change in negative fair value movements represents an 6% reduction.\n\nThis disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable input parameters. However, it is unlikely in practice that all unobservable parameters would be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives.\n\nFor many of the financial instruments considered here, in particular derivatives, unobservable input parameters represent only a  subset  of  the  parameters  required  to  price  the  financial  instrument,  the  remainder  being  observable.  Hence,  for  these instruments the overall impact of moving the unobservable input parameters to the extremes of their ranges might be relatively small compared with the total fair value of the financial instrument. For other instruments, fair value is determined based on the price of the entire instrument, for example, by adjusting the fair value of a reasonable proxy instrument. In addition, all financial instruments are already carried at fair values which are inclusive of valuation adjustments for the cost to close out that instrument and hence already factor in uncertainty as it reflects itself in market pricing. Any negative impact of uncertainty calculated within this disclosure, then, will be over and above that already included in the fair value contained in the financial statements.\n\n## Breakdown of the

        "page_content": "## Quantitative information about the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs\n\nThe behavior of the unobservable parameters on Level 3 fair value measurement is not necessarily independent, and dynamic relationships often exist between the other unobservable parameters and the observable parameters. Such relationships, where material to the fair value of a given instrument, are explicitly captured via correlation parameters, or are otherwise controlled via pricing models or valuation techniques. Frequently, where a valuation technique utilizes more than one input, the choice of a certain input will bound the range of possible values for other inputs. In addition, broader market factors (such as interest rates, equity, credit or commodity indices or foreign exchange rates) can also have effects.\n\nThe range of values shown below represents the highest and lowest inputs used to value the significant exposures within Level 3. The diversity of financial instruments that make up the disclosure is significant and therefore the ranges of certain parameters can be large. For example, the range of credit spreads on mortgage-backed securities represents performing, more liquid positions with lower spreads than the less liquid, non-performing positions which will have higher credit spreads. As Level 3 contains the less liquid fair value instruments, the wide ranges of parameters seen is to be expected, as there is a high degree of pricing differentiation within each exposure type to capture the relevant market dynamics. The table below provides a brief description of each of the principal parameter types, along with a commentary on significant interrelationships between them.\n\nCredit Parameters are used to assess the creditworthiness of an exposure, by enabling the probability of default and resulting losses of a default to  be  represented.  The  credit  spread  is  the  primary  reflection  of  creditworthiness  and  represents  the premium  or  yield  return  above  the  benchmark  reference  instrument  (typically  LIBOR,  or  relevant  Treasury  Instrument, depending upon the asset being assessed), that a bond holder would require to allow for the credit quality difference between that entity and the reference benchmark. Higher credit spreads will indicate lower credit quality, and lead to a lower value for a given bond, or other loan-asset that is to be repaid to the Bank by the borrower. Recovery Rates represent an estimate of the amount a lender would receive in the case of a default of a loan, or a bond holder would receive in the case of default of the bond. Higher recovery rates will give a higher valuation for a given bond position, if other parameters are held constant. Constant Default Rate and Constant Prepayment Rate allow more complex loan and debt assets to be assessed, as these parameters estimate the ongoing defaults arising on scheduled repayments and coupons, or whether the borrower is making additional (usually voluntary) prepayments. These parameters are particularly relevant when forming a fair value opinion for mortgage or other types of lending, where repayments are delivered by the borrower through time, or where the borrower may pre-pay the loan (seen for example in some residential mortgages). Higher Constant Default Rate will lead to lower valuation of a given loan or mortgage as the lender will ultimately receive less cash.\n\nInterest  rates,  credit  spreads,  inflation  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and  equity  prices  are  referenced  in  some  option instruments, or other complex derivatives, where the payoff a holder of the derivative will receive is dependent upon the behavior of these underlying references through time. Volatility parameters describe key attributes of option behavior by enabling the variability of returns of the underlying instrument to be assessed. This volatility is a measure of probability, with higher volatilities denoting higher probabilities of a particular outcome occurring. The underlying references (interest rates, credit spreads etc.) have an effect on the valuation of options, by describing the size of the return that can be expected from the option. Therefore, the value of a given option is dependent upon the value of the underlying instrument, and the volatility of that instrument, representing the size of the payoff, and the probability of that payoff occurring. Where volatilities are high, the option holder will see a higher option value as there is greater probability of positive returns. A higher option value will also occur where the payoff described by the option is significant.\n\nCorrelations  are  used  to  describe  influential  relationships  between  underlying  references  where  a  derivative  or  other instrument has more than one underlying reference. Behind some of these relationships, for example commodity correlation and interest rate-foreign exchange correlations, typically lie macroeconomic factors such as the impact of global demand on groups of commodities, or the pricing parity effect of interest rates on foreign exchange rates. More specific relationships can exist between credit references or equity stocks in the case of credit derivatives and equity basket derivatives, for example. Credit correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the credit performance of a range of credit names, and stock correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the returns of a range of equities. A derivative with a correlation exposure will be either long- or short-correlation. A high correlation suggests a strong relationship between the underlying references is in force, and this will lead to an increase in value of a long-correlation derivative. Negative correlations suggest that the relationship between underlying references is opposing, i.e., an increase in price of one underlying reference will lead to a reduction in the price of the other.\n\nAn EBITDA ('earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization') multiple approach can be used in the valuation of less liquid securities. Under this approach the enterprise value ('EV') of an entity can be estimated via identifying the ratio of the EV to EBITDA of a comparable observable entity and applying this ratio to the EBITDA of the entity for which a valuation is being estimated. Under this approach a liquidity adjustment is often applied due to the difference in liquidity between the generally listed comparable used and the company under valuation. A higher EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a higher fair value.",

Many of the parameter inputs  to  the  valuation  of  instruments  in  this  level  of  the  hierarchy  are  observable  and  the  gain  or  loss  is  partly  due  to movements  in  these  observable  parameters  over  the  period.  Many  of  the  positions  in  this  level  of  the  hierarchy  are economically hedged by instruments which are categorized in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The offsetting gains and losses that have been recorded on all such hedges are not included in the table below, which only shows the gains and losses related to the Level 3 classified instruments themselves held at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13. The unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 instruments are included in both net interest income and net gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                     | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Financial assets held at fair value:                                        |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | 29             | (298)          |\n| Positive market values from derivative financial instruments                | 1,347          | (2,907)        |\n| Other trading assets                                                        | 59             | (251)          |\n| Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss | (47)           | 247            |\n| Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss            | 0              | (0)            |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income           | (2)            | 0              |\n| Other financial assets at fair value                                        | (0)            | 0              |\n| Total financial assets held at fair value                                   | 1,385          | (3,209)        |\n| Financial liabilities held at fair value:                                   |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | 4              | 3              |\n| Negative market values from derivative financial instruments                | (1,287)        | 1,634          |\n| Other trading liabilities                                                   | 0              | 2              |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss       | (53)           | 55             |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value                                   | (268)          | 358            |\n| Total financial liabilities held at fair value                              | (1,604)        | 2,053          |\n| Total                                                                       | (219)          | (1,156)        |",

        "page_content": "## 14 -Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value\n\nFinancial instruments not carried at fair value are not managed on a fair value basis. For these instruments fair values are calculated for disclosure purposes only and do not impact the Group balance sheet or income statement. Additionally, since the instruments generally do not trade, there is significant management judgment required to determine these fair values. Differences in carrying value versus fair value as of December 31, 2023, are consistent with current interest rate environment as compared to December 31, 2022.\n\nFor  the  following  financial  instruments  which  are  predominantly  short-term,  the  carrying  value  represents  a  reasonable estimate of the fair value:\n\n| Assets                                                                     | Liabilities                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and central bank balances                                             | Deposits                                                                       |\n| Interbank balances (w/o central banks)                                     | Central bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase  agreements |\n| Central bank funds sold, and securities purchased under resale  agreements | Securities loaned                                                              |\n| Securities borrowed                                                        | Other short-term borrowings                                                    |\n| Other financial assets                                                     | Other financial liabilities                                                    |\n\nFor all other financial instruments carried at amortized cost, the following valuation techniques are applied:\n\n- -Retail lending portfolios with a large number of homogenous loans (e.g., residential mortgages) calculate the fair value for each product type by discounting the portfolio's contractual cash flows using the Group's new loan rates for lending to borrowers of similar credit quality, which includes the impact of the macroeconomic environment. Key inputs for retail mortgages  are  the  difference  between  historic  and  current  product  margins  and  the  estimated  prepayment  rates. Capitalized broker fees included in the carrying value are also considered to be at fair value\n- -The fair value of the corporate lending portfolio is estimated predominantly by discounting the loan until it's maturity, based on the loan specific credit spreads and funding costs for the Group.\n- -For long-term debt and trust preferred securities, fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available. Where quoted market prices are not available,  fair  value  is  estimated  using  a  valuation  technique  that  discounts  the remaining contractual cash flows at a rate at which an instrument with similar characteristics is quoted in the market.\n- -A discounted cash flow model is generally used for determining the fair value of deposits since market data is usually not available. In addition to the yield curve, Deutsche Bank's own credit spread is also considered. Credit spreads of the respective counterparties are not used in the measurement of fair value on financial liabilities at amortized cost.\n\nFor these financial instruments carried at amortized costs, the disclosed fair value is categorized under the IFRS fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) as outlined in Note 13- Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value. In general, Level 1 includes Cash and Central bank balances; Level 2 includes Interbank balances (w/o central banks), Central bank funds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed, Other financial assets, Deposits, Central bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, Securities loaned, Other short- term borrowings, Other financial liabilities, Long- term debt and Trust preferred securities; and Level 3 includes Loans.",

retail mortgages in Germany compared to the contractual rate. As part of Postbank IT migration project, the Group has aligned its risk management modelling approach of interest rate prepayment risk factors for its long-dated retail mortgages in Germany in the third quarter 2023. This resulted in an increase of the fair value of such mortgages by \u20ac 2.5 billion. Partly offsetting the loan carrying amount were macro hedge accounting adjustments under the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, which were \u20ac 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \u20ac 7.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. The deposits' fair value was greater than the carrying value as the carrying value included negative macro hedge accounting adjustments  under  the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS 39  of  \u20ac 3.4 billion  and  \u20ac 7.7 billion  as  of  December 31,  2023,  and December 31, 2022, respectively. For long-term debt and trust preferred securities, the difference between fair value and carrying value is due to the change in interest rates at which the Group could issue debt with similar maturity and subordination at the balance sheet date compared to the rate the instrument was issued at. The carrying values included in the table do not include any impacts from economic hedges.",

The most common transactions of this nature entered into by the Group are repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and total return swaps, in which the Group retains substantially all of the associated credit, equity price, interest rate and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets as well as the associated income streams.\n\n## Information on asset types and associated transactions that did not qualify for derecognition\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                     | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Carrying amount of transferred assets                                       |                |                |\n| Trading securities not derecognized due to the following transactions:      |                |                |\n| Repurchase agreements                                                       | 45,106         | 30,201         |\n| Securities lending agreements                                               | 10,155         | 8,313          |\n| Total return swaps                                                          | 4,483          | 1,461          |\n| Other                                                                       | 5,060          | 4,480          |\n| Total trading securities                                                    | 64,804         | 44,455         |\n| Other trading assets                                                        | 138            | 171            |\n| Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss | 203            | 1,077          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income           | 7,080          | 2,351          |\n| Loans at amortized cost 1                                                   | 26             | 104            |\n| Others                                                                      | 8,674          | 3,815          |\n| Total                                                                       | 80,924         | 51,973         |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities                                   | 70,706         | 43,820         |\n\n## Carrying value of assets transferred to the Group has continuing involvement\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                     | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Carrying amount of the original assets transferred                          |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | 1,043          | 1,059          |\n| Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss | 317            | 328            |\n| Carrying amount of the assets continued to be recognized                    |                |                |\n| Trading securities                                                          | 28             | 34             |\n| Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss | 16             | 16             |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities                                   | 78             | 95             |",

This ongoing involvement will be recognized as a new instrument which may be different from the original financial asset that was transferred. Typical transactions include retaining  senior  notes  of  non-consolidated  securitizations  to  which  originated  loans  have  been  transferred;  financing arrangements with structured entities to which the Group has sold a portfolio of assets; or sales of assets with credit-contingent swaps. The Group's exposure to such transactions is not considered to be significant as any substantial retention of risks associated with the transferred asset will commonly result in an initial failure to derecognize. Transactions not considered to result in an ongoing involvement include normal warranties on fraudulent activities that could invalidate a transfer in the event of  legal  action,  qualifying

        "page_content": "## 22 -Leases\n\nThe Group's disclosures are as a lessee under lease arrangements covering property and equipment. The Group has applied judgement in presenting related information pursuant to IFRS 16 in a manner that it considers to be most relevant to an understanding of its financial performance and position.\n\nThe Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vehicles and IT equipment. The Group is a lessee for the majority of its offices and branches under long-term rental agreements. Most of the lease contracts are made under usual terms and conditions, which means they include options to extend the lease by a defined amount of time, price adjustment clauses and escalation clauses in line with general office rental market conditions. However, the lease agreements do not include any clauses that impose any restriction on the Group's ability to pay dividends, engage in debt financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022), the Group recorded right-of-use assets on its balance sheet with a carrying amount of \u20ac 4.0 billion (\u20ac 4.0 billion), which are included in Property and equipment. The right-of-use assets predominantly represented  leased  properties  of  \u20ac 4.0 billion  (\u20ac 4.0 billion)  and  vehicle  leases  of  \u20ac 13 million  (\u20ac 10 million).  For  more information on the year-to-date development of right-of-use assets, please refer to Note 21 'Property and Equipment'.\n\nCorresponding  to  the  recognition  of  the  right-of-use  assets,  as  of  December 31,  2023  (December 31,  2022),  the  Group recorded lease liabilities on its balance sheet with a carrying amount of \u20ac 4.5 billion (\u20ac 4.5 billion), which are included in Other liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the lease liabilities included the discounted value of future lease payments of \u20ac 477 million for the Group headquarters in Frankfurt am Main that was sold and leased back on December 1, 2011. The lease has a fixed term through to the end of 2036, with options to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods to the end of 2046.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, interest expenses recorded from the compounding of the lease liabilities amounted to \u20ac 113 million and \u20ac 85 million, respectively. The contractual maturities for the undiscounted cash flows from these liabilities are shown in Note 31 'Maturity Analysis of the earliest contractual undiscounted cash flows of Financial Liabilities'.\n\nExpenses recognized in 2023 (2022) relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, for which the Group decided to apply the recognition exemption under IFRS 16 (and thus not to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet), amounted to \u20ac 1 million (\u20ac 1 million) and \u20ac 0 million (\u20ac 0 million), respectively.\n\nIncome recorded in 2023 (2022) from the subletting of right-of-use assets totaled \u20ac 29 million (\u20ac 29 million).\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases for 2023 (2022) was \u20ac 645 million (\u20ac 691 million) and represented mainly expenditures made for  real  estate  rentals  over  \u20ac 638 million  (\u20ac 683 million).  Of  the  total  cash  outflow  amount,  payments  of  \u20ac 534 million (\u20ac 607 million) were made for the principal portion of lease liabilities, payments of \u20ac 111 million (\u20ac 84 million) were made for the interest portion.\n\nTotal future cash outflows to which the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed, that are not reflected in the measurement of the lease liabilities, mainly include potential payment exposures arising from extension options (2023: \u20ac 4.9 billion) and future payments for leases not yet commenced, but to which the Group is committed (2023: \u20ac 40 million). Their expected maturities are shown in the table below.\n\n## Future cash outflows to which the Group is potentially exposed that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                  | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Future cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities: |                |                |\n| Not later than one year                                  | 14             | 14             |\n| Later than one year and not later than five years        | 590            | 613            |\n| Later than five years                                    | 4,318          | 5,226          |\n| Future cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities  | 4,922          | 5,852          |",

Given the valuation of the Investment Bank CGU with a continued shortfall of its recoverable amount versus its carrying amount, the goodwill was considered impaired and fully written off in the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2022 only included foreign exchange rate movements of Asset Management goodwill held in nonGroup currencies.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2021 related to the reclassification of \u20ac 56 million of Asset Management goodwill to assets held for sale, following the designated sale of DWS' digital investment platform to a joint venture with BlackFin and foreign exchange rate movements. Following the acquisition of a payment service provider (Better Payment Germany GmbH) in September 2021 (see Note 3), as part of the purchase price allocation the Group had recorded goodwill of \u20ac 5 million assigned to the Corporate Bank CGU. Given the valuation of the CGU continued to have a shortfall of its recoverable amount versus its carrying amount, the newly acquired goodwill was considered impaired and fully written off in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the appropriate CGU on the basis as described in Note 1 'Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'. The Group's primary CGUs are as outlined above. Asset Management's goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter by comparing the recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount. In addition, the Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is identified. The recoverable amount is the higher of a CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The Asset Management CGU was the only goodwill carrying CGU to be tested for annual impairment in 2021, 2022 and 2023. The impairment tests conducted on Asset Management in these periods did not result in an impairment loss as the recoverable amounts of the Asset Management CGU were higher than the respective carrying amounts.\n\nA  review  of  the  Group's  strategy  or  certain  political  or  global  risks  for  the  banking  industry,  uncertainties  regarding  the implementation of already adopted regulation and the introduction of legislation that is already under discussion could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\n\n## Carrying Amount\n\nThe carrying amount of a primary CGU is derived using a capital allocation model based on the Shareholders' Equity Allocation Framework  of  the  Group  (please  refer  to  Note 4,  'Business  Segments  and  Related  Information'  for  more  details).  The allocation uses the Group's total equity at the date of valuation, including Additional Tier 1 Notes (AT1 Notes), which constitute unsecured and subordinated notes of Deutsche Bank and which are classified as additional equity components in accordance with IFRS. Total equity is adjusted for an add-on adjustment for goodwill attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Recoverable Amount\n\nThe Group determines the recoverable amounts of its primary CGUs on the basis of the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). It employs a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which reflects the specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the present value of the estimated future  earnings  that  are  distributable  to  shareholders  after  fulfilling  the  respective  regulatory  capital  requirements.  The recoverable amounts also include the fair value of the AT1 Notes, which are allocated to the primary CGUs.\n\nThe DCF model uses earnings projections and respective capitalization assumptions based on five-year financial plans as well as longer term expectations on the impact of regulatory developments, which are discounted to their present value. Estimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current performances as well as expected developments in the respective markets, and in the overall macroeconomic and regulatory environments. Earnings projections beyond the initial five-year period are, where applicable, adjusted to derive a sustainable level. In case of a going concern, the cash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a constant long-term growth rate for the Asset Management CGU of up to 3.0% (2022: up to 3.0%). This is based on projected revenue forecasts of the CGU as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and inflation and is captured in the terminal value.",

        "page_content": "## Key Assumptions and Sensitivities\n\nKey Assumptions: The DCF value of a CGU is sensitive to the earnings projections, to the discount rate (cost of equity) applied and, to a lesser extent, to the long-term growth rate. The discount rates applied have been determined based on the capital asset pricing model and comprise a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium and a factor covering the systematic market risk (beta factor). The values for the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factors are determined using external sources of information. CGU-specific beta factors are determined based on a respective group of peer companies. Variations in all of these components might impact the discount rates. For the Asset Management CGU, the discount rates (after tax) applied for 2023 and 2022 were 10.9% and 10.3%, respectively.\n\nManagement determined the values for the key assumptions in the following table based on a combination of internal and external analysis. Estimates for efficiency and the cost reduction program are based on progress made to date and scheduled future projects and initiatives.\n\n## Key management assumptions are:\n\n| Primary goodwill-  carrying cash- generating unit   | Description of key assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Uncertainty associated with key assumptions and potential  events/circumstances that could have a negative effect                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | -  Maintaining leadership in mature markets (e.g., Equity,  Multi-Asset and Fixed income)                                                                                                                                               | -  Challenging market environment and volatility  unfavorable to its investment strategies  -  Unfavorable margin development and adverse  competition levels in key markets and products beyond |\n| Asset Management                                    | -  Expanding true areas of strength like Xtrackers and  Alternatives  -  Further build out digital capabilities  -  Expand distribution partnerships to expand its global  business  -  Continue a multi-year execution to replace core | expected levels  -  Business/execution risks, e.g., underachievement of  net flow targets from market uncertainty, loss of high- quality client facing employees, unfavorable investment         |\n\nSensitivities: In order to test the resilience of the recoverable amount, key assumptions used in the DCF model (for example, the  discount  rate  and  the  earnings  projections)  are  sensitized.  Currently,  in  Asset  Management  the  recoverable  amount exceeds the carrying amount by 14% / \u20ac 1.0 billion.\n\n## Change in certain key assumptions to cause the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount\n\n| Change in Key Assumptions                             | Asset  Management   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Discount rate (post tax) increase                     |                     |\n| from                                                  | 10.9%               |\n| to                                                    | 12.0%               |\n| Change in projected future earnings in each period by | (10.9)%             |\n| Long term growth rate                                 |                     |\n| from                                                  | 3.0%                |\n| to                                                    | 0.9%                |",

        "page_content": "## Amortizing Intangible Assets\n\nIn 2023, amortizing intangible assets increased by \u20ac 330 million. This includes amortization expenses of \u20ac 1.1 billion, mostly for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.1 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 24 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of \u20ac 1.3 billion resulting from the capitalization of expenses incurred in conjunction with the Group's development of own-used software overcompensated the negative impact from amortization and impairment charges on net book value. A stronger euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for net negative exchange rate changes of \u20ac (19) million.\n\nIn 2022, amortizing intangible assets increased by \u20ac 173 million. This includes amortization expenses of \u20ac 1.0 billion, mostly for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.0 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 30 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of \u20ac 1.1 billion resulting from the capitalization of expenses incurred in conjunction with the Group's development of own-used software overcompensated the negative impact from amortization and impairment charges on net book value. A weaker euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for net positive exchange rate changes of \u20ac 50 million.\n\nIn 2021, amortizing other intangible assets remained nearly unchanged, decreasing only slightly by \u20ac 22 million. This reflects amortization expenses of \u20ac 1.0 billion, mostly for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (\u20ac 1.0 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (\u20ac 149 million). Additions to internally generated intangible  assets  of  \u20ac 1.1 billion  resulting  from  the  capitalization  of  expenses  incurred  in  conjunction  with  the  Group's development of own-used software compensated for the decrease in net book value. A weaker euro exchange rate against major currencies accounted for positive exchange rate changes of \u20ac 42 million.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortized over their useful lives based on the straight-line method.\n\n## Useful lives of other amortized intangible assets by asset class\n\n|                                         | Useful lives  in years   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Internally generated intangible assets: |                          |\n| Software                                | up to 10                 |\n| Purchased intangible assets:            |                          |\n| Customer-related intangible assets      | up to 20                 |\n| Other                                   | up to 20                 |\n\n## Unamortized Intangible Assets\n\nWithin  this  asset  class,  the  Group  recognizes  certain  contract-based  and  marketing-related  intangible  assets,  which  are deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\n\nIn particular, the asset class comprises the below detailed investment management agreements related to retail mutual funds and certain trademarks. Due to the specific nature of these intangible assets, market prices are ordinarily not observable and, therefore, the Group values such assets based on the income approach, using a post-tax DCF-methodology.\n\nRetail investment management agreements: These assets, amounting to \u20ac 716 million, relate to the Group's U.S. retail mutual fund business and are allocated to the Asset Management CGU. Retail investment management agreements are contracts that give Asset Management the exclusive right to manage a variety of mutual funds for a specified period. Since these contracts are easily renewable at minimal cost, these agreements are not expected to have a foreseeable limit on the contract period. Therefore, the rights to manage the associated assets under management are expected to generate cash flows for an indefinite period of time. This intangible asset was recorded at fair value based upon a valuation provided by a third party at the date of acquisition of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. in 2002.\n\nThe recoverable amount was calculated as fair value less costs of disposal using the multi-period excess earnings method applying a five-year plan and the fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key assumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal include the asset mix, the flows forecast, the effective fee rate and discount rate as well as the terminal value growth rate. The discount rate (cost of equity) applied in the annual impairment test was 10.9% in 2023 (10.6% in 2022). The terminal value growth rate applied for 2023 was 3.4% (for 2022 3.8%).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the impairment analysis did not result in an impairment. As of December 31, 2022, an impairment loss of \u20ac 68 million was recognized in the Group's income statement within impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, due to net outflows and change in discount rate to 10.9% in the fourth quarter 2022.",

It  was  agreed  that  DWS  would  transfer  its  digital  investment  platform  into  a  joint  venture  with  BlackFin, maintaining a stake of 30%. The transaction to transfer the digital investment platform into the newly established company MorgenFund GmbH closed as of November 30, 2022. As part of the consideration, the Group received a 30% stake in that company which is accounted for under the equity method and held in the Asset Management division.\n\n## Sale of the Italian financial advisors business to Zurich Italy\n\nIn August 2021, Deutsche Bank and Zurich Insurance Group Italy ('Zurich Italy') reached an agreement with Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A. to acquire Deutsche Bank's Financial Advisors business in Italy. Closing of the sale was announced on October 17, 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 1,085 Financial Advisors, 96 employees, and approximately \u20ac 16 billion in assets under management (of which \u20ac 1 billion Discretionary Portfolio Management still managed by Deutsche Bank) have passed to Zurich Bank Italy S.p.A. The pre-tax gain on sale totaled \u20ac 312 million and was recorded in the Private Bank segment results in the fourth quarter of 2022.",

The  definition  used  for  the  purposes  of  determining  operational  provisions  differs  from  the  risk management definition, as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes, operational risk includes legal risk, as payments to customers, counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings, but excludes business and reputational risk.\n\nCivil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with contractual or other legal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in demands from customers, counterparties or other parties in civil litigations.\n\nRegulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with legal or  regulatory  responsibilities,  which  have  resulted  or  may  result  in  an  assessment  of  fines  or  penalties  by  governmental regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities.\n\nRestructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its long-term competitiveness through major reductions in costs, duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note 10 'Restructuring'.\n\nOther provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances, including the provision for the reimbursement of loan processing fees, deferred sales commissions, provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase demands.\n\n## Provisions and Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision for potential loss only when there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is probable to result in an economic outflow that can be reliably estimated. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made for such an obligation, no provision is recognized and the obligation is deemed a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities also include possible obligations for which the possibility of future economic outflow is more than remote but less than probable. Where a provision has been taken for a particular claim, no contingent liability is recorded; for matters or sets of matters consisting of more than one claim, however, provisions may be recorded for some claims, and contingent liabilities (or neither a provision nor a contingent liability) may be recorded for others.\n\nThe Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation risks. As a result, the Group is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including the United States. In recent years, regulation and supervision in a number of areas have increased, and regulators, governmental bodies and others have sought to subject financial services providers to increasing oversight and scrutiny, which in turn has led to additional regulatory investigations and enforcement actions which are often followed by civil litigation.",

        "page_content": "In determining for which of the claims the possibility of a loss is probable, or less than probable but more than remote, and then estimating the possible loss for those claims, the Group takes into consideration a number of factors, including but not limited to the nature of the claim and its underlying facts, the procedural posture and litigation history of each case, rulings by the courts or tribunals, the Group's experience and the experience of others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the Group), prior settlement discussions, settlements by others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the Group), available indemnities and the opinions and views of legal counsel and other experts.\n\nThe provisions the Group has recognized for civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are set forth in the table above. For some matters when the Group believes an outflow of funds is probable, but the Group could not reliably estimate the amount of the potential outflow, no provision was recognized.\n\nFor the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made, but the probability of a future loss or outflow of resources is more than remote but less than probable, the Group currently estimates that, as of December 31, 2023, these contingent liabilities are  approximately  \u20ac 1.9 billion  for  civil  litigation  matters  (December 31,  2022:  \u20ac 1.8 billion)  and  \u20ac 0.2 billion  for  regulatory enforcement matters (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 0.1 billion). These figures include matters where the Group's potential liability is joint and several and where the Group expects any such liability to be paid by a third party. If the Group's best estimate is within a range, the amount at the top of the range is disclosed for contingent liabilities.\n\nFor other significant civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the Group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is more than remote but less than probable, but the amount is not reliably estimable, such matters are not included in the contingent liability estimates. In addition, where the Group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is remote, the Group has neither recognized a provision nor included the matters in the contingent liability estimates.\n\nThis estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, variables and known and unknown uncertainties. These uncertainties may include inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the Group, particularly at the preliminary stages of matters, and assumptions by the Group as to future rulings of courts or other tribunals or the likely actions or positions taken by  regulators  or  adversaries  may  prove  incorrect.  Moreover,  estimates  of  possible  loss  for  these  matters  are  often  not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools frequently used in making judgments and estimates, and are subject to even greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the Group must exercise judgment and make estimates. The estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, can be and often are substantially less than the amount initially requested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could be incurred were the matters to result in a final adjudication adverse to the Group. Moreover, in several regions in which the Group operates, an adversary often is not required to set forth the amount it is seeking, and where it is, the amount may not be subject to the same requirements that generally apply to pleading factual allegations or legal claims.\n\nThe matters for which the Group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time to time, as will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. Actual results may prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such an estimate was made. In addition, loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the Group believed the likelihood of loss was remote. In particular, the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the Group's potential maximum loss exposure for those matters.\n\nThe Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. It may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to  contest  liability,  even  when  the  Group  believes  it  has  valid  defenses  to  liability.  It  may  also  do  so  when  the  potential consequences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. Furthermore, the Group may, for similar reasons, reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe that it is legally compelled to do so.\n\n## Current Individual Proceedings\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters or groups of matters for which the Group has taken material provisions, or for which there are material contingent liabilities that are more than remote, or for which there is the possibility of material business or reputational risk, as well as other significant matters; similar matters are grouped together and some matters consist of a number of proceedings or claims. The disclosed matters also include matters for which the possibility of a loss is more than remote but for which the Group cannot reliably estimate the possible loss. Matters are presented below in English-language alphabetical order based on the titles the Group has used for them.",

        "page_content": "Biscayne. On July 6, 2021, the bank and several Group entities were named as defendants in a civil litigation filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the defendants facilitated or negligently failed  to uncover a scheme  orchestrated  by  certain  bank  customers  referred  to  as  the  'Biscayne'  entities.  The  action  was  brought  by  the liquidators appointed for these entities. The matter proceeded to trial in April 2023 and resulted in an adverse jury trial verdict of U.S. $ 95 million. The bank appealed the verdict to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 22, 2024, the parties executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which the bank will pay the liquidators U.S. $ 43.5 million, and all claims against the bank and the Group entities will be dismissed. The settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida on February 28, 2024.\n\nConsent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve. On July 19, 2023, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, DB USA Corporation, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and DWS USA Corporation entered into a Consent  Order  and  Written  Agreement  with  the  Federal  Reserve  resolving  previously  disclosed  regulatory  discussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML compliance, and remedial agreements  and  obligations  related  to  risk  management  issues.  The  Consent  Order  alleges  insufficient  and  tardy implementation of the post-settlement sanctions and embargoes and AML control enhancement undertakings required by prior Consent Orders the bank entered into with the Federal Reserve in 2015 and 2017. The Written Agreement alleges various deficiencies in governance, risk management, and internal controls across the bank's U.S. operations, and finds that the bank must continue to implement additional improvements. The Consent Order requires Deutsche Bank to pay a civil monetary penalty of U.S. $ 186 million, including U.S. $ 140 million for the violations alleged with respect to the post-settlement sanctions and embargoes and AML control enhancement undertakings, as well as a separate penalty of U.S. $ 46 million for unsafe or unsound practices stemming from the bank's handling of its legacy correspondent banking relationship with Danske Bank Estonia, which was terminated in October 2015. The Written Agreement does not include a civil monetary penalty. Both the Consent Order and Written Agreement include certain post-settlement remediation and reporting undertakings.\n\nCum-ex Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, in relation to cum-ex transactions of clients. 'Cum-ex' refers to trading activities in German shares around dividend record dates (trade date before and settlement date after dividend record date) for the purpose of obtaining German tax credits or refunds in relation to withholding tax levied on dividend payments, including transaction structures that have resulted in more than one market participant claiming such credit or refund with respect to the same dividend payment. Cum-ex transactions are regarded as criminal tax evasion by German courts. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in these matters.\n\nThe  Public  Prosecutor  in  Cologne  ( Staatsanwaltschaft  K\u00f6ln ,  'CPP')  has  been  conducting  a  criminal  investigation  since August 2017 concerning two former employees of Deutsche Bank in relation to cum-ex transactions of certain former clients of the bank. In October 2022, the CPP conducted a search at Deutsche Bank's offices in Frankfurt and Eschborn. Based on the search warrant the CPP expanded the scope of the investigation. Current and former Deutsche Bank employees and seven former Management Board members are included in the investigation. The investigation is still at an early stage and the scope of the investigation may be further broadened. Deutsche Bank is a potential secondary participant pursuant to Section 30 of the German Law on Administrative Offences in this proceeding. This proceeding could result in a disgorgement of profits and fines. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the CPP.\n\nIn May 2021, Deutsche Bank learned through an information request received by Deutsche Oppenheim Family Office AG (DOAG) as legal successor of Sal. Oppenheim jr. & Cie. AG & Co. KGaA (Sal. Oppenheim) that the CPP in 2021 opened a criminal investigation proceeding in relation to cum-ex transactions against unknown former personnel of Sal. Oppenheim. DOAG provided the requested information.\n\nOn July 12, 2023, Deutsche Bank as legal successor of Deutsche Postbank AG was informed by the CPP that the CPP has opened a new separate criminal cum-ex investigation against unnamed personnel of former Deutsche Postbank AG.\n\nDeutsche  Bank  acted  as  participant  in  and  filed  withholding  tax  refund  claims  through  the  electronic  refund  procedure ( elektronisches Datentr\u00e4gerverfahren )  on  behalf  of,  inter  alia,  two  former  custody  clients  in  connection  with  their  cum-ex transactions. In February 2018, Deutsche Bank received from the German Federal Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt f\u00fcr Steuern , 'FTO') a demand of approximately \u20ac 49 million for tax refunds paid to a former custody client. Deutsche Bank expects to receive a formal notice for the same amount. In December 2019, Deutsche Bank received a liability notice from the FTO requesting payment of \u20ac 2.1 million in connection with tax refund claims Deutsche Bank had submitted on behalf of another former custody client, which Deutsche Bank paid in early 2020. In July 2022, Deutsche Bank filed a claim against the payment with the Fiscal Court of Cologne ( Finanzgericht K\u00f6ln ).",

        "page_content": "In 2018, The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (BNY) informed Deutsche Bank of its intention to seek indemnification for potential cum-ex related tax liabilities incurred by BHF Asset Servicing GmbH (BAS) and/or Frankfurter Service KapitalanlageGmbH ('Service KAG', now named BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH). Deutsche Bank had acquired BAS and Service KAG as part of the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in 2010 and sold them to BNY later that year. BNY estimated the potential tax liability  to  be  up  to  \u20ac 120 million  (excluding  interest  of  6%  p.a.).  In  late  2020,  counsel  to  BNY  informed Deutsche Bank that BNY and/or Service KAG (among others) have received notices from tax authorities in the estimated amount with respect to cum-ex related trades by certain investment funds in 2009 and 2010. BNY has filed objections against the  notices.  Following  receipt  of  payment  orders  from  tax  authorities  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac 118.3 million  in  relation  to  the investment funds and after consultation with Deutsche Bank, BNY paid \u20ac 53.6 million to tax authorities. A further \u20ac 50.9 million were paid by third parties. In addition, BNY received from the Frankfurt Tax Office regarding one of the investment funds a notice and payment request regarding penalty interest ( Hinterziehungszinsen )  in  the  amount of  \u20ac 11.6 million. BNY, after consultation  with  Deutsche  Bank,  applied  for  a  suspension  of  enforcement  ( Aussetzung  der  Vollziehung )  regarding  the payment request which is now pending at the Fiscal Court of Hesse ( Hessisches Finanzgericht ).\n\nIn  December 2023, Deutsche Bank received hearing letters from the German Federal Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt f\u00fcr Steuern ) regarding two third party investment funds that engaged in cum-ex trades in 2009. Deutsche Bank had provided services and financing to investors in the funds. Both funds received an aggregate of \u20ac 87 million in cum-ex withholding tax refunds in 2009. In February 2024, Deutsche Bank responded to the hearing letters.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nFX Derivatives Products Investigations and Litigation. Following an internal investigation into the historical sales of certain FX derivatives products, Deutsche Bank is providing information to and otherwise cooperating with its regulators. In December 2023, the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) announced it will initiate proceedings against Deutsche Bank, S.A.E. for advisory services provided to Spanish clients in relation to FX derivative products. Separately, in September 2021, Deutsche Bank was served with a claim that was filed in the High Court of England and Wales by four companies within the Palladium Hotels Group (PHG). PHG is claiming restitution or damages for alleged losses estimated at \u20ac 500 million in respect of FX derivatives trades entered into with Deutsche Bank between 2013 and 2019. They allege that the trades were mis-sold by Deutsche Bank and that one of the four PHG claimants lacked legal capacity to enter into some of the trades. Deutsche Bank has filed a defense disputing the claim. In January 2024, PHG filed amended pleadings to include additional allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation. Deutsche Bank filed an amended defense in February 2024 which disputes the new allegations. Trial is scheduled to commence in early 2025.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nFX Investigations  and  Litigations.  Deutsche  Bank  has  received  requests  for  information  from  certain  regulatory  and  law enforcement agencies globally who investigated trading in, and various other aspects of, the foreign exchange market.\n\nIn 2018, a group of asset managers opted out of a consolidated class settlement and filed litigation on an individual basis, alleging a conspiracy between traders at 16 banks to manipulate FX benchmark rates and to widen FX currency pair spreads in the period 2003 to 2013 ( Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. ). Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted and denied in part in 2020, and the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. Deutsche Bank has also been named as a defendant in an amended and consolidated class action filed in Israel. This action asserts factual allegations similar to those made in the consolidated action in the United States and seeks damages pursuant to Israeli antitrust law as well as other causes of action. This action is in preliminary stages.\n\nIn 2020, Deutsche Bank was named in an action issued in the UK High Court of Justice (Commercial Court) brought by many of the same plaintiffs who brought Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. referred to above. The claim is based upon factual allegations similar to those made in Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. In March 2022, the High Court ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. Deutsche Bank has reached an agreement to resolve the Allianz proceedings in the U.S. and UK In May 2023, both the U.S. and UK proceedings were dismissed in their entirety.\n\nIn May 2021, Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco Alemao was named in a civil antitrust action brought in the S\u00e3o Paulo Civil Court of  Central  Jurisdiction  by  the  Association  of  Brazilian  Exporters  (AEB)  against  certain  FX  dealers  and  affiliated  financial institutions  in  Brazil.  This  action  asserts  factual  allegations  based  on  conduct  investigated  by  the  Brazilian  competition authority, CADE, and seeks damages pursuant to Brazilian antitrust law. In February 2022, the presiding judge dismissed the action on the basis that the action was not appropriate for a class proceeding. AEB has appealed the decision. Deutsche Bank has not yet been served.",

        "page_content": "The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.\n\nInterbank and Dealer Offered Rates Matters. Regulatory and Law Enforcement Matters. Deutsche Bank has responded to requests for information from, and cooperated with, various regulatory and law enforcement agencies, in connection with industry-wide investigations concerning the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) and other interbank and/or dealer offered rates.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2017, Deutsche Bank entered into settlements with the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and other regulators with respect to interbank and dealer offered rates matters. Other investigations of Deutsche Bank concerning the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates remain ongoing.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it  has established  a provision  or  contingent  liability  with  respect  to  the  remaining investigations because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.\n\nOverview of Civil Litigations. Deutsche Bank is party to four U.S. civil actions concerning alleged manipulation relating to the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates which are described in the following paragraphs, as well as actions pending in the UK, Israel, Argentina and Spain. Most of the civil actions, including putative class actions, are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), against Deutsche Bank and numerous other defendants. All of the U.S. civil actions were filed on behalf of parties who allege losses as a result of manipulation relating to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR.\n\nClaims for damages for all four of the U.S. civil actions discussed have been asserted under various legal theories, including violations of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, federal and state antitrust laws, the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other federal and state laws. The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\nU.S. dollar LIBOR . With one exception, all of the U.S. civil actions concerning U.S. dollar LIBOR are being coordinated as part of a multidistrict litigation (the 'U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL') in the SDNY. In light of the large number of individual cases pending against Deutsche Bank and their similarity, the civil actions included in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL are now subsumed under the following general description of the litigation pertaining to all such actions, without disclosure of individual actions except when the circumstances or the resolution of an individual case is material to Deutsche Bank.\n\nFollowing a series of decisions in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL between March 2013 and March 2019 narrowing their claims, plaintiffs  are  currently  asserting  antitrust  claims,  claims  under  the  U.S.  Commodity  Exchange  Act  and  U.S.  Securities Exchange Act and state law fraud, contract, unjust enrichment and other tort claims. The court has also issued decisions dismissing certain plaintiffs' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and on statute of limitations grounds.\n\nIn 2016, the district court issued a ruling dismissing certain antitrust claims while allowing others to proceed. Multiple plaintiffs filed appeals of that ruling. In December 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on antitrust standing grounds but reversed the court's decision on personal jurisdiction grounds, and it remanded the cases to the district court for further proceedings. In March 2022, defendants (including Deutsche Bank) filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' decision. The U.S. Supreme Court denied defendants' petition in June 2022.\n\nIn October 2023, plaintiffs in a formerly stayed class action pending as part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL ( National Asbestos Workers Pension Fund, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al. ) filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing their case in its entirety.\n\nIn August 2020, plaintiffs filed a non-class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several financial institutions, alleging that U.S. dollar LIBOR has been suppressed through the present. In September 2022, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Later in 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court granted in October 2023. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an amended notice of appeal in November 2023.",

        "page_content": "There is a further UK civil action regarding U.S. dollar LIBOR brought by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) acting as receiver for 19 failed financial institutions headquartered in the U.S., in which a claim for damages has been asserted pursuant to EU, UK and U.S. state laws. In February 2022, following a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in relation to USD LIBOR antitrust claims, the UK LIBOR proceedings were stayed until July 2022, to allow for clarification of the position in relation to the parallel proceedings brought by the FDIC against Deutsche Bank in the U.S. The FDIC filed an application to reinstate proceedings in the United States in July 2022. Following the expiration of the UK stay, at a case management conference that took place in December 2022, the UK Court ordered a trial of a sample of three of  the  failed  financial  institutions.  This  'sample  bank'  trial  has  been  listed  for  a  19-week  trial  in  February  2026.  In December 2022, the SDNY granted the FDIC's application to reinstate certain of its claims against Deutsche Bank (and the other foreign defendants) in the U.S. to the extent these claims survived a motion to dismiss on the merits and subject to defendants' reservation of rights to dispute the claims in the future.\n\nA further class action regarding LIBOR has been filed in Argentina seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by holders of Argentine bonds with interest rates based on LIBOR. Deutsche Bank is defending this action.\n\nGBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR. Putative class actions alleging manipulation of GBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR were pending but have been settled, with final approvals granted in 2023, in the amounts of U.S. $ 5 million and U.S. $ 13 million, respectively. Accordingly, the actions are no longer reflected in the litigation provisions.\n\nJeffrey Epstein Matters. In December 2018, Deutsche Bank began the process to terminate its client relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,  which  began  in  August  2013.  Since  Epstein's  arrest  in  July  2019,  Deutsche  Bank  provided  information  to  and cooperated with various regulatory and law enforcement agencies concerning the bank's former client relationship with Epstein (individually, and through related parties and entities), completed an internal investigation into the Epstein relationship, and entered into settlements to resolve certain regulatory and litigation matters, as outlined below.\n\nIn 2020, the DFS issued a Consent Order, finding that Deutsche Bank violated New York State banking laws in connection with its relationships with three former Deutsche Bank clients, Danske Bank's Estonia branch, Jeffrey Epstein and FBME Bank, and imposing a U.S. $ 150 million civil penalty in connection with these three former relationships, which Deutsche Bank paid in the third quarter of 2020. The Bank was also named as a defendant in a securities class action in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY that included allegations relating to the bank's relationship with Epstein and other entities. In September 2022, the parties reached a class action settlement in the amount of U.S. $ 26.3 million, which the Court approved in an order dated February 6, 2023.\n\nIn addition, on November 24, 2022, Deutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY by an unnamed alleged sex trafficking victim of Epstein, alleging claims against the bank under the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act,  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt  Organizations  Act  and  New  York  state  law  in connection the bank's former client relationship with Epstein. In May 2023, the parties reached a class action settlement in the amount of U.S. $ 75 million, which the Court approved in an order dated October 20, 2023.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, Deutsche Bank and the Attorney General of New Mexico ('NMAG') announced a U.S. $ 5 million pledge by Deutsche Bank to fund additional resources to prevent, investigate, and prosecute human trafficking in the state of New Mexico. Deutsche Bank made that pledge following the NMAG's ongoing investigation into various financial services firms' banking relationships with Epstein.\n\nOn November 23, 2023, Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) were named as defendants in a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court by an alleged victim of Epstein. However, Deutsche Bank has still not been served in this action. The complaint, amended on December 31, 2023, contains the same Trafficking Victims Protection Act and New York law claims that were filed in the recently settled class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY mentioned above.",

        "page_content": "KOSPI Index Unwind Matters. Following the decline of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (the 'KOSPI 200') in the closing auction on November 11, 2010 by approximately 2.7%, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service commenced an investigation and expressed concerns that the fall in the KOSPI 200 was attributable to a sale by Deutsche Bank of a basket of stocks, worth approximately \u20ac 1.6 billion, that was held as part of an index arbitrage position on the KOSPI 200. On August 19,  2011,  the  Korean  Prosecutor's  Office  indicted  DSK  and  four  employees  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  group  on  charges  of spot/futures-linked market manipulation. In January 2016, the Seoul Central District Court rendered guilty verdicts against a DSK trader and DSK. A criminal fine of KRW 1.5 billion (less than \u20ac 2 million) was imposed on DSK. The criminal trial verdicts against both the DSK trader and against DSK were overturned on appeal in a decision rendered by the Seoul High Court in December 2018. The Korean Prosecutor's Office's appeal of the Seoul High Court decision was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023.\n\nIn addition, a number of civil actions have been filed in Korean courts against Deutsche Bank and DSK by certain parties who allege they incurred losses as a consequence of the fall in the KOSPI 200. The one outstanding claim was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023.\n\nMonte Dei Paschi. In March 2013, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) initiated civil proceedings in Italy against Deutsche Bank alleging that Deutsche Bank assisted former MPS senior management in an accounting fraud on MPS, by undertaking repo transactions with MPS and 'Santorini', a wholly owned special-purpose vehicle of MPS, which helped MPS defer losses on a previous transaction undertaken with Deutsche Bank. In December 2013, Deutsche Bank reached an agreement with MPS to settle the civil proceedings and the transactions were unwound.\n\nA criminal investigation was launched by the Siena Public Prosecutor into the transactions entered into by MPS with Deutsche Bank and certain unrelated transactions entered into by MPS with other parties. Such investigation was moved in summer 2014  from  Siena  to  the  Milan  Public  Prosecutors  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  the  alleged  charges  being  investigated.  In October 2016, the Milan court committed all defendants in the criminal proceedings to trial.\n\nIn November 2019, the Milan court issued its verdicts, finding five former employees and one current employee of Deutsche Bank guilty and sentencing them to either 3 years and 6 months or 4 years and 8 months. Deutsche Bank was found liable under Italian Legislative Decree n. 231/2001 and the court ordered the seizure of alleged profits of \u20ac 64.9 million and a fine of \u20ac 3 million. The Court also found Deutsche Bank had civil vicarious liability for damages (to be quantified by the civil court) as an employer of the current and former employees who were convicted. The sentences and fines were not due until the conclusion of any appeal process. Following appeals filed by Deutsche Bank and the six former or current employees, in 2022, the Milan Court of Appeal acquitted all the Deutsche Bank defendants from all the charges, found Deutsche bank not liable under Italian Legislative Decree n. 231/2001, revoked the confiscation of \u20ac 64.9 million and the fine of \u20ac 3 million ordered against Deutsche Bank, and revoked the finding of civil vicarious liability for damages. The Public Prosecutor filed an appeal against the Milan Court of Appeal verdicts before the Supreme Court in November 2022. On October 11, 2023, the Supreme Court declared the Public Prosecutor's appeal inadmissible and confirmed the acquittal decisions of the Milan Court of Appeal, which are now therefore final. While the criminal proceedings are concluded, there nonetheless remains the possibility of potential future civil claims.\n\nIn May 2018, CONSOB, the authority responsible for regulating the Italian financial markets, issued fines of \u20ac 100,000 each against the six current and former employees of Deutsche Bank who are defendants in the criminal proceedings. The six individuals were also banned from performing management functions in Italy and for Italian based institutions for three to six months each. No separate fine or sanction was imposed on Deutsche Bank, but it is jointly and severally liable for the six current/former Deutsche Bank employees' fines. In June 2018, Deutsche Bank and the six individuals filed an appeal in the Milan Court of Appeal challenging CONSOB's decision. In December 2020, the Milan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals filed by Deutsche Bank and the six current and former employees and annulled the resolution sanctioning them. CONSOB filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision in June 2021. Deutsche Bank and the six individuals have opposed the appeal.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.",

        "page_content": "Mortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities - Issuer and Underwriter Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank has been named as defendant  in  numerous  civil  litigations  brought  by  private  parties  in  connection  with  its  various  roles,  including  issuer  or underwriter, in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and other asset-backed securities. These cases, described below, allege that the offering documents contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including with regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. The Group has recorded provisions with respect to several of these civil cases, but has not recorded provisions with respect to all of these matters. The Group has not disclosed the amount of these provisions because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the resolution of these matters.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in an action related to RMBS offerings brought by the FDIC as receiver for Citizens National Bank and Strategic Capital Bank (alleging an unspecified amount in damages against all defendants). In this action, the appellate  court  reinstated  claims  previously  dismissed  on  statute  of  limitations  grounds,  and  petitions  for  rehearing  and certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. In May 2022, the FDIC voluntarily dismissed its claim with respect to one of the RMBS offerings and Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the remaining claim. Deutsche Bank's motion has been fully briefed as of July 2022. Discovery is stayed pending resolution of Deutsche Bank's motion.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in cases concerning two RMBS trusts that were brought initially by RMBS investors and subsequently by HSBC, as trustee, in New York state court. The cases allege breaches of Deutsche Bank's purported duty to notify the trustee of breaches of loan-level representations and warranties in the ACE Securities Corp. 2006-FM1 and ACE Securities Corp. 2007-ASAP1 RMBS offerings, respectively. The cases originally asserted claims against Deutsche Bank for breaches of representations and warranties, but those claims were dismissed as untimely, and the appellate court affirmed in April 2019. Discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn October 2019, plaintiffs filed two complaints (one by HSBC as trustee and one by certificate holders) seeking to revive, under Section 205(a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, the untimely breach of representations and warranties claims as to which dismissal was affirmed in the case concerning ACE 2006-FM1. The trial court dismissed the certificate holder action, and the First Department affirmed in 2022. The certificate holders filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which was denied on February 20, 2024. The trial court also dismissed the trustee revival action filed by HSBC. In November 2022, HSBC filed an appeal that remains pending.\n\nIn  the  actions  against  Deutsche  Bank  solely  as  an  underwriter  of  other  issuers'  RMBS  offerings,  Deutsche  Bank  has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers, but those indemnity rights may in whole or in part prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now or may in the future be in bankruptcy or otherwise defunct.\n\nMortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities - Trustee Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiaries Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (DBNTC) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) (collectively, the 'Trustees') are defendants in two separate civil lawsuits, and DBNTC is a defendant in a third civil lawsuit, brought by investors concerning the Trustees' role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. The actions generally allege claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, negligence and/or violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, based on the Trustees' alleged failure to perform adequately certain obligations and/or duties as trustee for the trusts.\n\nThe three lawsuits include actions by (a) the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA), as an investor in 18 trusts that allegedly suffered total realized collateral losses of more than U.S. $ 3.7 billion; (b) Commerzbank AG, as an investor in 50  RMBS trusts,  alleging  hundreds  of millions  of  dollars  in  losses;  and  (c)  IKB  International,  S.A.  in  liquidation  and  IKB Deutsche  Industriebank  A.G.  (collectively,  'IKB'),  as  an  investor  in  15  RMBS  trusts,  originally  seeking  more  than  U.S. $ 268 million of damages before IKB voluntarily discontinued its claims as to certain RMBS certificates. In the NCUA case, DBNTC's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part, dismissing NCUA's tort claims but preserving its breach-of-contract claims. Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment, and those motions are fully briefed and pending before the court. In February 2022, the court in the Commerzbank case granted in part and denied in part DBNTC's and DBTCA's motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of the tort claims and dismissing the breach of contract claims relating to certain of the trusts, and denied Commerzbank's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. Discovery is ongoing. In January 2021, the court in the IKB case granted in part and denied in part the Trustees' motion to dismiss, dismissing certain of IKB's claims but allowing certain of its breach of contract and tort claims to go forward; the Trustees appealed certain aspects of that order, and IKB cross-appealed with respect to other aspects. In August 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's order on the motion to dismiss. DBNTC and DBTCA appealed certain aspects of the First Department's decision. On June 15, 2023, the New York Court of Appeals modified the First Department's decision in part, dismissing certain additional contract claims and IKB's remaining tort claims. Discovery is ongoing.\n\nThe Group has established contingent liabilities with respect to certain of these matters, but the Group has not disclosed the amounts because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of these matters.",

        "page_content": "Polish Mortgage Matters. Starting in 2016, certain clients of Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. have reached out to Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. alleging that their mortgage loan agreements in foreign currency include unfair clauses and are invalid. These clients have demanded reimbursement of the alleged overpayments under such agreements totaling over \u20ac 685 million with over 5000 civil claims having been commenced in Polish courts as of February 29, 2024. These cases are an industry wide issue in Poland and other banks are facing similar claims. Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. has and will take necessary legal actions to defend itself and challenge such claims in courts.\n\nDuring 2023, there was a deterioration in the risk profile with respect to the Polish FX mortgage portfolio, especially following an adverse decision by the European Court of Justice on June 15, 2023, which affected the broader Polish banking sector. In addition, the bank refined its model for estimating the provision in the third quarter for the expected development of court verdicts and other market parameters. As a result, the provision for this matter increased by \u20ac 244 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the total provision as of December 31, 2023 is \u20ac 534 million.\n\nPostbank Voluntary Public Takeover Offer. On September 12, 2010, Deutsche Bank announced the decision to make a voluntary takeover offer for the acquisition of all shares in Deutsche Postbank AG (Postbank). On October 7, 2010, the bank published its official takeover offer and offered Postbank shareholders a consideration of \u20ac 25 for each Postbank share. This offer was accepted for a total of approximately 48.2 million Postbank shares.\n\nIn November 2010, a former shareholder of Postbank, Effecten-Spiegel AG, which had accepted the takeover offer, brought a claim against Deutsche Bank alleging that the offer price was too low and was not determined in accordance with the applicable German laws. The plaintiff alleges that Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all shares in Postbank, at the latest, in 2009 as the voting rights of Deutsche Post AG in Postbank had to be attributed to Deutsche Bank pursuant to Section 30 of the German Takeover Act. Based thereon, the plaintiff alleges that the consideration offered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover offer needed to be raised to \u20ac 57.25 per share.\n\nThe Regional Court Cologne (Landgericht) dismissed the claim in 2011 and the Cologne appellate court dismissed the appeal in 2012. The Federal Court set this judgment aside and referred the case back to the Higher Regional Court Cologne to take evidence on certain allegations of the plaintiff.\n\nStarting in 2014, additional former shareholders of Postbank, who accepted the 2010 tender offer, brought similar claims as Effecten-Spiegel AG against Deutsche Bank which were pending with the Regional Court Cologne and the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, respectively. On October 20, 2017, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision granting the claims in a total of 14 cases which were combined in one proceeding. The Regional Court Cologne took the view that Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer already in 2008 so that the appropriate consideration to be offered in the takeover offer should have been \u20ac 57.25 per Postbank share (instead of \u20ac 25). The additional consideration per share owed to shareholders which have accepted the takeover offer would thus amount to \u20ac 32.25. Deutsche Bank appealed this decision to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 the Higher Regional Court Cologne heard a number of witnesses in both cases and issued orders for the production of relevant transaction documents entered into between Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Post AG in 2008 and 2009.\n\nOn December 16, 2020, the Higher Regional Court  Cologne handed down  a  decision and  fully  dismissed  the  claims  of Effecten-Spiegel AG. Further, in a second decision handed down on December 16, 2020, the Higher Regional Court Cologne granted  the  appeal  of  Deutsche  Bank  against  the  decision  of  the  Regional  Court  Cologne  dated  October 20,  2017  and dismissed all claims of the plaintiffs. All relevant plaintiffs lodged appeals with the German Federal Court ( Bundesgerichtshof ) which on December 13, 2022 announced its decision, setting aside the judgments of the Higher Regional Court of Cologne and remanding the cases back to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne. The Higher Regional Court of Cologne scheduled a hearing for April 26, 2024.\n\nDeutsche Bank has been served with a large number of additional lawsuits filed against Deutsche Bank shortly before the end of 2017, almost all of which are now pending with the Regional Court Cologne. Some of the new plaintiffs allege that the consideration offered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover should be raised to \u20ac 64.25 per share.\n\nThe claims for payment against Deutsche Bank in relation to these matters total almost \u20ac 700 million (excluding interest, which is significant due to the long duration of the proceedings).\n\nThe Group has established a contingent liability with respect to these matters, but the Group has not disclosed the amount of this contingent liability because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome of these matters.",

        "page_content": "The legal question of whether Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all Postbank shares prior to its 2010 voluntary takeover may impact two pending appraisal proceedings ( Spruchverfahren ). These proceedings were initiated by former Postbank shareholders with the aim to increase the cash compensation offered in connection with the squeeze-out  of  Postbank  shareholders  in 2015  and  the  cash  compensation  offered  and  annual  compensation  paid  in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement ( Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf\u00fchrungsvertrag ) between DB Finanz-Holding AG (now DB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH) and Postbank in 2012.\n\nThe applicants in the appraisal proceedings claim that a potential obligation of Deutsche Bank to make a mandatory takeover offer for Postbank at an offer price of \u20ac 57.25 should be decisive when determining the adequate cash compensation in the appraisal proceedings. The Regional Court Cologne had originally followed this legal view of the applicants in two resolutions. In a decision dated June 2019, the Regional Court Cologne expressly gave up this legal view in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. According to this decision, the question whether Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory offer for all Postbank shares prior to its voluntary takeover offer in 2010 shall not be relevant for determining the appropriate cash compensation. It is likely that the Regional Court Cologne will take the same legal position in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the squeeze-out. On October 1, 2020, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision in the appraisal proceeding concerning the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (dated December 5, 2012) according to which the annual compensation pursuant to Section 304 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( j\u00e4hrliche Ausgleichszahlung ) shall be increased by \u20ac 0.12 to \u20ac 1.78 per Postbank share and the settlement amount pursuant to Section 305 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Abfindungsbetrag ) shall be increased by \u20ac 4.56 to \u20ac 29.74 per Postbank share. The increase of the settlement amount is of relevance for approximately 492,000 former Postbank shares whereas the increase of the annual compensation is of relevance for approximately 7 million former Postbank shares. Deutsche Bank as well as the applicants have lodged an appeal against this decision.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this matter because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously its outcome.\n\nRusChemAlliance Litigation. In June 2023, RusChemAlliance LLC (RCA), a Russian joint venture of Gazprom PJSC and RusGasDobycha JSC, filed a claim against Deutsche Bank before a commercial state court in Saint Petersburg. A court hearing took place on October 31, 2023. A further hearing on the merits has been scheduled for April 16, 2024. RCA is seeking payment of approximately \u20ac 238 million (excluding interest) under an advance payment guarantee (APG) issued by Deutsche Bank in 2021 at the request of one of its clients, with RCA named as beneficiary.\n\nRCA made a payment demand under the APG which was rejected by Deutsche Bank due to the imposition of EU sanctions against Russia. The Russian court has accepted this claim and assumed jurisdiction contrary to the contractual arrangements in the APG which provide for arbitration in Paris. It can thus be assumed that the Russian court will also not recognize the applicability of the EU sanctions. Deutsche Bank maintains assets in Russia which could be seized if the claim would be granted  and  enforced.  Deutsche  Bank  is  entitled  to  indemnification  from  its  client  with  respect  to  the  bank's  payment obligations under the advance payment guarantee and the legal fees and costs related to the court proceedings and the enforcement  of  a  negative  court  decision.  Deutsche  Bank  has  recognized  a  provision  in  the  amount  of  approximately \u20ac 260 million  and  a  corresponding  reimbursement  asset  under  the  indemnification  agreement.  The  expense  from  the recognition of the provision is offset by the income from the recognition of the reimbursement asset.\n\nSovereign, Supranational and Agency Bonds (SSA) Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to SSA bond trading. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with these investigations.\n\nOn May 24, 2023, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) sent a statement of objections to Deutsche Bank regarding a potential breach of United Kingdom antitrust rules in relation to the sale, secondary market trading and buy-back auctions of United Kingdom government bonds, which includes Gilts and Gilt asset swaps, between 2009 and 2013. Deutsche Bank proactively cooperated with the CMA in this matter and as a result has been granted full provisional immunity. The sending of a statement of objections is a step in the CMA's investigation and does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation, which is ongoing.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, the European Commission announced its decision that Deutsche Bank and one other bank in the past breached EU antitrust rules in relation to secondary market trading of Euro-denominated SSA bonds, and to a very limited extent government guaranteed bonds. Deutsche Bank has proactively cooperated with the European Commission in this matter and, as a result, has been granted full immunity. In accordance with the European Commission's guidelines, no financial penalty was imposed on Deutsche Bank. The timeframe of the alleged infringement ended in 2016.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, Deutsche Bank was notified that the Mexican competition authority, COFECE, reached a resolution that imposes fines against DB Mexico and two of its former traders, as well as six other financial institutions and nine other traders, for engaging in alleged monopolistic practices in the Mexican government bond secondary market. DB Mexico has appealed. The fine against DB Mexico was approximately U.S. $ 427,000.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in a putative class action filed on June 16, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY by alleged direct market participants claiming a violation of antitrust law related to alleged manipulation of the secondary trading market for United Kingdom government bonds. The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys' fees. The case is in the early stages.\n\nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in a putative class action filed in December 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY by alleged direct market participants claiming a violation of antitrust law related to alleged manipulation of the secondary trading market for Euro-denominated Sovereign bonds. The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys' fees. The case is in the early stages.\n\nDeutsche Bank is also a defendant in putative class actions filed in 2017 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and Federal Court of Canada, respectively, claiming violations of antitrust law and the common law relating to alleged manipulation of secondary trading of SSA bonds. The complaints seek compensatory and punitive damages. On July 20, 2022, Deutsche Bank entered into a national settlement agreement that would resolve the Canadian Federal SSA claim against all Deutsche Bank defendants. The settlement agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Canada.\n\nDeutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a consolidated putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY alleging  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  law  and  a  claim  for  unjust  enrichment  relating  to  Mexican  government  bond  trading. Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' consolidated amended complaint was granted without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint naming only Mexico-based defendants, which was also dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, and on February 9, 2024, the dismissal of the complaint was reversed.\n\nOther than as noted above, the Group has not disclosed whether it has established provisions or contingent liabilities with respect to the matters referred to above because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.\n\n- U.S. Treasury Securities Investigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to U.S. Treasuries auctions, trading, and related market activity. Deutsche Bank has cooperated with these investigations.\n\nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc., the bank's primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary (DBSI), was a defendant in several putative class actions alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and common law related to the alleged manipulation of the U.S. Treasury securities market. These cases have been consolidated in the SDNY. In 2017, the court  dismissed  DBSI  from  the  class  action  without  prejudice.  Defendants  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  a  second  amended complaint, which was granted. Plaintiffs' notice of appeal to the Second Circuit remains pending.\n\nIn  2020,  the  CFTC  entered  an  order  pursuant  to  settlement  with  DBSI  for  alleged  spoofing  by  two  Tokyo-based  traders between January and December 2013. Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions therein, Deutsche Bank consented to the entry of the order, including a civil monetary fine.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.\n\n- U.S. Treasury Spoofing Litigation. Following the bank's settlement with the CFTC mentioned above, five separate putative class actions were filed in the Northern District of Illinois against Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI. The cases allege that Deutsche Bank and other unnamed entities participated in a scheme from January to December 2013 to spoof the market for Treasuries futures and options contracts and Eurodollar futures and options contracts. Following briefing on a motion to dismiss, the judge ordered supplemental briefing on the issues of standing and jurisdictional discovery, which has now been substantially completed. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and then a further, second amended complaint. Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI filed a motion to dismiss on September 12, 2023 and a reply on December 13, 2023.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.",

        "page_content": "## 28 -Credit related commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business  the  Group  regularly  enters  into  irrevocable  lending  commitments,  including  fronting commitments as well as contingent liabilities consisting of financial and performance guarantees, standby letters of credit and indemnity agreements on behalf of its customers. Under these contracts the Group is required to perform under an obligation agreement or to make payments to the beneficiary based on third party's failure to meet its obligations. For these instruments it is not known to the Group in detail if, when and to what extent claims will be made. In the event that the Group has to pay out cash in respect of its fronting commitments, the Group would immediately seek reimbursement from the other syndicate lenders. The Group considers all the above instruments in monitoring the credit exposure and may require collateral to mitigate inherent credit risk. If the credit risk monitoring provides sufficient perception about a loss from an expected claim, a provision is established and recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nThe following table shows the Group's revocable lending commitments, irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions. It shows the maximum potential utilization of the Group in case all these liabilities entered into must be fulfilled. The table therefore does not show the expected future cash flows from these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising claims will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral.\n\n## Irrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities\n\n| in \u20ac m.                         | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Irrevocable lending commitments | 206,084        | 202,595        |\n| Revocable lending commitments   | 49,325         | 48,425         |\n| Contingent liabilities          | 65,131         | 67,214         |\n| Total                           | 320,540        | 318,234        |\n\n## Other commitments and other contingent liabilities\n\nThe  Group's  other  irrevocable  commitments  and  other  contingent  liabilities  without  considering  collateral  or  provisions amounted to \u20ac 74.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and to \u20ac 73.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The number considers the maximum potential utilization of the Group in case all these liabilities entered into must be fulfilled. It therefore does not contain the expected future cash flows from these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising claims will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral.\n\n## Government assistance\n\nIn the course of its business, the Group regularly applies for and receives government support by means of Export Credit Agency ('ECA') guarantees covering transfer and default risks for the financing of exports and investments into Emerging Markets and to a lesser extent, developed markets for Structured Trade & Export Finance and short- and medium-term Trade Finance business. Almost all export-oriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. The ECAs act in the name and on behalf of the government of their respective country and are either constituted directly as governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to act on its behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs act within the scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ('OECD') consensus rules. The OECD consensus rules,  an  intergovernmental  agreement  of  the  OECD  member  states,  define  benchmarks  intended  to  ensure  that  a  fair competition between different exporting nations will take place.\n\nIn some countries dedicated funding programs with governmental support are offered for ECA-covered financings. The Group makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services. In certain financings, the Group also receives government guarantees from national and international governmental institutions as collateral to support financings in the interest of the respective governments. The majority of such ECA guarantees received by the Group were issued either by the Euler-Hermes S.A. acting on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, by the Atradius Credito y Caucion S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation acting on behalf of the Republic of Korea.",

        "page_content": "## Irrevocable payment commitments with regard to levies and deposit protection\n\nCertain entities of the Group are required to make contributions to national resolution authorities or deposit protection schemes such as the European Single Resolution Fund (SRF) of the Single Resolution Board (SRB). Part of such contributions may be provided in the form of irrevocable payment commitments (IPCs) backed by cash and securities collateral.\n\nIPCs related to the bank levy according to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the SRF and the deposit protection provided by the German deposit protection fund amounted to \u20ac 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 1.3 billion). Thereof \u20ac 1.0 billion of IPCs related to the SRF (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 0.9 billion).\n\nDuring 2023, the Group provided additional IPCs of \u20ac 119 million to the SRF and \u20ac 54 million to the German deposit protection fund, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total collateral consisted of \u20ac 1.4 billion of cash collateral and \u20ac 81 million of securities collateral (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 1.2 billion and \u20ac 78 million respectively). Thereof \u20ac 1.0 billion of cash collateral related to the SRF (December 31, 2022: \u20ac 0.9 billion).\n\nThe Group accounts for IPCs as contingent liabilities as it is not deemed probable that IPCs will be called. Also, the Group remains the economic owner of the collateral provided.\n\nIn October 2023, in a matter unrelated to the Group, the General Court of the EU handed down a judgement which supported the SRB in its view that in case an entity that no longer falls within the scope of the Single Resolution Mechanism, its IPCs are cancelled and collateral backing these commitments is only returned if the entity pays a cash contribution to the SRF at the same amount. The plaintiff filed an appeal against this judgement to the Court of Justice of the EU in January 2024. The Group is of the view that its accounting analysis for IPCs with regard to the SRF and deposit protection remains unaffected as of December 31, 2023, and continues to monitor the legal developments and their potential accounting impact.",

Therefore, each share has a nominal value of \u20ac 2.56, derived by dividing the total amount of share capital by the number of shares.\n\n| Number of shares                                   | Issued and  fully paid   | Treasury shares   | Outstanding                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Common shares, January 1, 2022                     | 2,066,773,131            |                   | (678,948)     2,066,094,183    |\n| Shares issued under share-based compensation plans | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Capital increase                                   | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Common shares cancelled                            | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Shares purchased for treasury                      | 0                        | (55,830,172)      | (55,830,172)                   |\n| Shares sold or distributed from treasury           | 0                        | 27,577,502        | 27,577,502                     |\n| Common shares, December 31, 2022                   | 2,066,773,131            |                   | (28,931,618)     2,037,841,513 |\n| Shares issued under share-based compensation plans | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Capital increase                                   | 0                        | 0                 | 0                              |\n| Common shares cancelled                            | (26,530,172)             | 26,530,172        | 0                              |\n| Shares purchased for treasury                      | 0                        | (81,868,366)      | (81,868,366)                   |\n| Shares sold or distributed from treasury           | 0                        | 36,074,703        | 36,074,703                     |\n| Common shares, December 31, 2023                   | 2,040,242,959            |                   | (48,195,109)     1,992,047,850 |\n\nThere are no issued ordinary shares that have not been fully paid.\n\nThe Group has bought back shares pursuant to share buyback authorizations by the Annual General Meetings. All such transactions were recorded in shareholders' equity and no revenues and expenses were recorded in connection with these activities. Treasury stock held as of year-end will mainly be used for cancellation with the purpose of distributing capital to shareholders as well as for future share-based compensation.\n\n## Authorized Capital\n\nThe Management Board is authorized to increase the share capital by issuing new shares for cash consideration. As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Bank AG had authorized but unissued capital of \u20ac 2,560,000,000 which may be issued in whole or in part until April 30, 2026.

This  plan  represents  a contingent right to receive Deutsche Bank common shares after a specified period of time. The award recipient is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of the award.\n\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of the Deutsche Bank Equity Plan may be forfeited fully or partly if the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or release period for Upfront Awards). Vesting usually continues after termination of employment in cases such as redundancy or retirement. Deferred share awards are subject to forfeiture provisions and performance conditions until release.\n\nIn countries where legal or other restrictions hinder the delivery of shares, a cash plan variant of the Deutsche Bank Equity Plan was used for granting awards, and for employees of certain legal entities, deferred equity is replaced with restricted shares due to local regulatory requirements.\n\nPlease note that this table does not cover awards granted to the Management Board. For awards granted under the DWS Equity Plan, please refer to the DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans section.",

Thereof, approximately \u20ac 0.8 billion and \u20ac 0.8 billion had been recognized as compensation expense in the reporting year or prior to that. Hence, compensation expense for deferred share-based compensation not yet recognized amounted to approximately \u20ac 0.3 billion and \u20ac 0.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans\n\nThe DWS Group made grants of share-based compensation under the DWS Equity Plan. This plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified time period.\n\nIn September 2018 one-off IPO related awards under the DWS Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan were granted to all DWS employees. A limited number of DWS senior managers were granted a one-off IPO-related Performance Share Unit under the DWS Equity Plan instead. For members of the Executive Board, one-off IPO-related awards under the DWS Equity Plan were granted in January 2019.\n\nThe DWS Stock Appreciation Rights Plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment equal to any appreciation (or gain) in the value of a set number of notional DWS shares over a fixed period of time. This award does not provide any entitlement to receive DWS shares, voting rights or associated dividends.\n\nThe DWS Equity Plan is a phantom share plan representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified period of time.\n\nThe award recipient for any share-based compensation plan is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of the award.\n\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of any share-based compensation plan are forfeited fully or partly if the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or the end of the retention period  for  Upfront  Awards).  Vesting  usually  continues  after  termination  of  employment  in  cases  such  as  redundancy  or retirement.",

The Group's plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. Generally, for defined benefit plans the value of a participant's accrued benefit is based on each employee's remuneration and length of service; contributions to defined contribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employee's remuneration. The rest of this note focuses predominantly on the Group's defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit plans are primarily described on a geographical basis, reflecting differences in the nature and risks of benefits, as well as in the respective regulatory environments. In particular, the requirements set by local regulators can vary significantly and determine the design and financing of the benefit plans to a certain extent. Key information is also shown based on participant status, which provides a broad indication of the maturity of the Group's obligations.\n\n|                                       | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                               | Germany        | UK             | U.S.           | Other          | Total          |\n| Defined benefit obligation related to |                |                |                |                |                |\n| Active plan participants              | 3,301          | 300            | 215            | 661            | 4,477          |\n| Participants in deferred status       | 1,926          | 1,450          | 509            | 87             | 3,972          |\n| Participants in payment status        | 5,277          | 1,276          | 448            | 231            | 7,232          |\n| Total defined benefit obligation      | 10,504         | 3,026          | 1,172          | 979            | 15,681         |\n| Fair value of plan assets             | 10,532         | 3,912          | 1,003          | 1,071          | 16,518         |\n| Funding ratio (in %)                  | 100%           | 129%           | 86% 1          | 109%           | 105%           |",

Within the other countries, the largest obligation relates to Switzerland. In Germany and some continental European countries, post-employment benefits are usually agreed on a collective basis with respective employee workers councils, unions or their equivalent. The Group's main pension plans are governed by boards of trustees, fiduciaries or their equivalent.\n\nPost-employment benefits can form an important part of an employee's total remuneration. The Group's approach is that their design shall be attractive to employees in the respective market, but sustainable for the Group to provide over the longer term. At the same time, the Group tries to limit its risks related to provision of such benefits. Consequently, the Group has moved to offer defined contribution plans in many locations over recent years.\n\nIn the past the Group typically offered pension plans based on final pay prior to retirement. These types of benefits still form a significant part of the pension obligations for participants in deferred and payment status. Currently, in Germany and the United States, the main defined benefit pension plans for active staff are cash account type plans where the Group credits an annual amount to individual accounts based on an employee's current compensation. Dependent on the plan rules, the accounts increase either at a fixed interest rate or participate in market movements of certain underlying investments to limit the investment risk for the Group. Sometimes, in particular in Germany, there is a guaranteed benefit amount within the plan rules, e.g. payment of at least the amounts contributed. Upon retirement, beneficiaries may usually opt for a lump sum, a fixed number of annual instalments or for conversion of the accumulated account balance into a life annuity. This conversion is often based on market conditions and mortality assumptions at retirement.\n\nThe Group also sponsors retirement and termination indemnity plans in several countries, as well as some post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees, mainly in the United States. The post-employment medical plans typically pay fixed percentages of medical expenses of eligible retirees after a set deductible has been met. In the United States, once a retiree is eligible for Medicare, the Group contributes to a Health Reimbursement Account and the retiree is no longer eligible for the Group's medical program. The Group's total defined benefit obligation for post-employment medical plans was \u20ac 145 million and \u20ac 144 million on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In combination with the benefit structure, these plans represent limited risk for the Group, given the nature and size of the post-retirement medical plan liabilities versus the size of the Group's balance sheet at year end 2023.\n\nThe following amounts of expected benefit payments from the Group's defined benefit plans include benefits attributable to employees' past and estimated future service and include both amounts paid from the Group's external pension trusts and paid directly by the Group in respect of unfunded plans.\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                             | Germany   |   UK |   U.S. |   Other | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Actual benefit payments 2023                                        | 498       |  109 |     89 |      50 | 746     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2024                                   | 543       |  154 |     81 |      76 | 854     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2025                                   | 551       |  138 |     83 |      71 | 843     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2026                                   | 568       |  146 |     88 |      68 | 870     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2027                                   | 586       |  160 |     87 |      70 | 903     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2028                                   | 603       |  171 |     92 |      71 | 937     |\n| Benefits expected to be paid 2029 - 2033                            | 3,252     |  925 |    447 |     350 | 4,974   |\n| Weighted average duration of defined benefit  obligation (in years) | 11        |   15 |      9 |      10 | 12      |",

        "page_content": "## Multi-employer Plans\n\nIn  Germany, the Group is a member of the BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV) together with other financial  institutions.  The  BVV  offers  retirement  benefits  to  eligible  employees  in  Germany  as  a  complement  to  postemployment benefit promises of the Group. Both employers and employees contribute on a regular basis to the BVV. The BVV provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fixed amounts if surplus assets arise within the plan. According to legislation in Germany, the employer is ultimately liable for providing the benefits to its employees. An increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. BVV is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. However, in line with industry practice, the Group accounts for it as a defined contribution plan  since  insufficient  information  is  available  to  identify  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  the  Group's  current  and  former employees, primarily because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to member companies.\n\n## Governance and Risk\n\nThe Group maintains a Pensions Committee to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. This Committee meets at least quarterly and reports directly to the Senior Executive Compensation Committee.\n\nWithin this context, the Group develops and maintains guidelines for governance and risk management, including funding, asset allocation and actuarial assumption setting.\n\nDuring and after acquisitions or changes in the external environment (e.g., legislation, taxation), topics such as the general plan design or potential plan amendments are considered. Any plan changes follow a process requiring approval by Group Human Resources and, above a certain threshold, also of the Pensions Committee.\n\nPension risk management is embedded in the Group's risk management organization, with strong focus on market risks given importance of capital market developments (e.g., interest rate, credit spread, price inflation) for the value of plan assets and liabilities, hence IFRS and regulatory capital. Risk management thereby encompasses regular measurement, monitoring and reporting of risks via specific metrics, as well as a risk control framework, e.g. via the establishment of risk limits or thresholds as applicable. Risk management activities also include the consideration, review and measurement of other financial risks, e.g. risks from demographic and other actuarial assumptions (e.g., longevity risk) but also the assessment of model, valuation and other non-financial risks.\n\nIn the Group's key pension countries, the Group's largest post-employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential changes in credit spreads, interest rates, price inflation and longevity, that are partially mitigated through the investment strategy adopted. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but introduce investment risk.\n\nOverall, the Group seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on the Group's financial position from market movements, subject to balancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints from local funding or accounting requirements.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe Group maintains various external pension trusts to fund the majority of its defined benefit plan obligations. The Group's funding principle is to maintain funding of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of 90% to 100% of the obligation, subject to meeting any local statutory requirements. The Group has also determined that certain plans should remain  unfunded,  although  their  funding  approach  is  subject  to  periodic  review,  e.g.  when  local  regulations  or  practices change. Obligations for the Group's unfunded plans are accrued on the balance sheet.\n\nFor many of the externally funded defined benefit plans there are local minimum funding requirements. The Group can decide on any additional plan contributions, with reference to the Group's funding principle. There are some locations, e.g. the United Kingdom, where the trustees and the Group jointly agree contribution levels. In most countries the Group expects to receive an economic benefit from any plan surpluses of plan assets compared to defined benefit obligations, typically by way of reduced future contributions. Given the relatively high funding level and the investment strategy adopted in the Group's key funded defined benefit plans, any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not expected to place the Group under any material adverse cash strain in the short term. With reference to the Group's funding principle, the Group considers not re-claiming benefits paid from the Group's assets as an equivalent to making cash contributions into the external pension trusts during the year.",

        "page_content": "During 2022, the majority of the German pension plans moved into surplus status due to significant market movements. The Group has claimed around \u20ac 860 million from the trust, which represents the benefits paid from the Bank's assets on behalf of the trust during 2022 including the forgiven re-imbursement of the prior year in order to limit the extent to which the Group breached the upper end of its target funding ratio. During 2023, reimbursements of \u20ac 490 million were also claimed for the benefits paid from the Group's assets on behalf of the trust.\n\nFor post-retirement medical plans, the Group accrues for obligations over the period of employment and pays the benefits from Group assets when the benefits become due.\n\n## Actuarial Methodology and Assumptions\n\nDecember 31 is the measurement date for all plans. All plans are valued by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. A Group policy provides guidance to ensure consistency globally on setting actuarial assumptions which are  finally  determined  by  the  Group's  Pensions  Committee.  Senior  management  of  the  Group  is  regularly  informed  of movements and changes in key actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe key actuarial assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit

using a bond universe sourced from reputable third-party market data providers, and reflects the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective plan. In 2023, a refinement was made to the Eurozone discount curve methodology in order to better align to long term market data resulting in a benefit recognized in Other Comprehensive Income of \u20ac 70 million.\n\nThe price inflation assumptions in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom are set with reference to market measures of inflation based on inflation swap rates in those markets at each measurement date. For other countries, the price inflation assumptions are typically based on long term forecasts by Consensus Economics Inc.\n\nThe assumptions for the increases in future compensation levels and for increases to pensions in payment are developed separately for each plan, where relevant. Each is set based on the price inflation assumption and reflecting the Group's reward structure or policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements.\n\nAmong other assumptions, mortality assumptions can be significant in measuring the Group's obligations under its defined benefit plans. These assumptions have been set in accordance with current best estimate in the respective countries. Future potential improvements in longevity have been considered and included where appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Investment Strategy\n\nThe Group's investment objective is to protect the Group from adverse impacts of its defined benefit pension plans on key financial metrics. The primary focus is to protect the plans' IFRS funded status in the case of adverse market scenarios. Since 2021, there has been a shift in the investment strategy in selected markets to balance competing key financial metrics. Investment managers manage pension assets in line with investment mandates or guidelines as agreed with the pension plans' trustees and investment committees.\n\nFor key defined benefit plans for which the Group aims to protect the IFRS funded status, the Group applies a liability driven investment approach. Risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to capital market movements are minimized, subject to balancing relevant trade-offs. This is achieved by allocating plan assets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, credit spreads and inflation. Thereby, plan assets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension obligations.\n\nWhere the desired hedging level for market risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments (i.e., corporate and government bonds), derivatives are employed. Derivative overlays mainly include interest rate, inflation swaps and credit default swaps. Other instruments are also used, such as interest rate futures and options. In practice, a completely hedged approach is impractical, for instance because of insufficient market depth for ultra-long-term corporate bonds, as well as liquidity and cost considerations. Therefore, plan assets contain further return-seeking asset categories such as equity, real estate, high yield bonds or emerging markets bonds to create long-term value and achieve diversification benefits. Furthermore, this shift in the investment strategy allows for actively taken market risk exposures from interest rates and credit spreads within defined limits governed by the Pensions Committee. As a result, the market risk from plan assets has been reduced.\n\nIn 2023, the Group entered into a buy-in transaction with a third party insurer to de-risk \u20ac 515 million of exposure to the UK defined  benefit  pension  schemes  funded  from  existing  assets,  with  no  additional  employer  contribution  required.  The recognition of the insurance policy as a qualifying plan asset negatively impacted Other Comprehensive Income in the Group's financial statement by approximately \u20ac 33 million. A similar buy-in transaction to de-risk \u20ac 410 million of exposure occurred in 2022  which  negatively  impacted  Other  Comprehensive  Income  in  the  Group's  financial  statement  by  approximately \u20ac 35 million. In total, the Group has entered into four buy-in transactions in the UK with third-party insurers protecting the Group from movements in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac 1.8 billion as at 31 December, 2023.\n\n## Plan asset allocation to key asset classes\n\nThe following table shows the asset allocation of the Group's funded defined benefit plans to key asset classes, i.e. exposures include physical securities in discretely managed portfolios and underlying asset allocations of any commingled funds used to invest plan assets.\n\nAsset amounts in the following table include both 'quoted' (i.e., Level 1 assets in accordance with IFRS 13 - amounts invested in markets where the fair value can be determined directly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets) and 'other' (i.e., Level 2 and 3 assets in accordance with IFRS 13) assets.",

        "page_content": "## Key Risk Sensitivities\n\nThe Group's defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in capital market conditions and actuarial assumptions. Sensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. Each market risk factor or assumption is changed in isolation. Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using geometric extrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. Duration is a risk measure that indicates the broad sensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable approximation for small to moderate changes in those assumptions.\n\nFor example, the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the interest rate based on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. The resulting duration is used to estimate the remeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. For other assumptions, a similar approach is used to derive the respective sensitivity results.\n\nFor  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  changes  in  capital  market  conditions  will  impact  the  plan  obligations  via  actuarial assumptions (e.g. via the discount rate and price inflation rate) as well as the plan assets' fair value. Where the Group applies a liability driven investment approach or has insured part of the obligations as in the UK, the Group's overall risk exposure to such changes is reduced. To help readers gain a better understanding of the Group's risk exposures to key capital market movements, the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to a change of the related market risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown. Where changes in actuarial assumptions do not affect plan assets, only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is reported.\n\nAsset-related sensitivities are derived for the Group's major plans by using risk sensitivity factors determined by the Group's Market Risk Management function. These sensitivities are calculated based on information provided by the plans' investment managers and extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets' market value in case of a change in the underlying risk factor.\n\nThe sensitivities illustrate plausible variations over time in capital market movements and key actuarial assumptions. The Group is not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. While these sensitivities illustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the aggregated results. Even though plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors, actual changes in plan assets and obligations may not fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and actuarial assumptions. Caution  should  be  used  when  extrapolating  these  sensitivities  due  to  non-linear  effects  that  changes  in  capital  market conditions and key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall funded status. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in these sensitivities.",

The deferred tax expense/(benefit) was positively impacted by \u20ac 1.1 billion in 2023, by \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2022 and by \u20ac 242 million in 2021.\n\nThe Global Minimum Taxation Rules or Pillar Two rules are applicable to Deutsche Bank starting in 2024, with Deutsche Bank AG as the ultimate parent. Deutsche Bank is required to annually calculate the global minimum tax or Pillar Two liability for group  entities  in  close  to  60  jurisdictions.  However,  temporary  relief  from  the  detailed  Pillar  Two  calculations,  which  is determined on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, may be available under transitional safe harbor provisions. These safe harbor provisions apply to tax years 2024-2026 and are based on the bank's country-by-country reports filed annually with the German tax authorities and certain other financial data. While uncertainties remain regarding the application of the Pillar Two rules, further legislative developments and interpretative guidance in many countries are expected over time, and implementation efforts are ongoing, Deutsche Bank has assessed the potential impact on its financial position for 2024 on a best effort basis. The assessment considered a number of qualitative and quantitative factors. For one, Deutsche Bank's blended statutory tax rate across all applicable jurisdictions on average ranges between 28% to 30%, which is significantly higher than the minimum tax rate of 15%. For example, in 2023 the blended statutory rate amounted to 30%. In addition, of the close to 60 countries, six countries apply a statutory tax rate of less than 15% to the bank's operations. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the most recently available country-by-country report, it is estimated that Deutsche Bank will qualify for relief under the transitional safe harbor provisions in most of the jurisdictions it operates in. As a result, Deutsche Bank estimates that it will not be subject to a material Pillar Two liability in 2024.\n\n## Difference between applying German statutory (domestic) income tax rate and actual income tax expense/(benefit)\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                                                  | 2023    | 2022    | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Expected tax expense (benefit) at domestic income tax rate of 31.3% (31.3% for 2022 and 31.3%  for 2021) | 1,777   | 1,751   | 1,061  |\n| Foreign rate differential                                                                                | (89)    | (117)   | (92)   |\n| Tax-exempt gains on securities and other income                                                          | (319)   | (217)   | (183)  |\n| Loss (income) on equity method investments                                                               | (0)     | (12)    | (11)   |\n| Nondeductible expenses                                                                                   | 392     | 429     | 287    |\n| Impairments of goodwill                                                                                  | 55      | (0)     | 1      |\n| Changes in recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets 1                                          | (1,238) | (1,891) | (227)  |\n| Effect of changes in tax law and/or tax rate                                                             | 7       | (20)    | (26)   |\n| Effect related to share-based payments                                                                   | (0)     | (5)     | 1      |\n| Other 1                                                                                                  | 202     | 18      | 69     |\n| Actual income tax expense (benefit)                                                                      | 787     | (64)    | 880    |\n\nThe domestic income tax rate, including corporate tax, solidarity surcharge, and trade tax, used for calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities was 31.3% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nChanges in recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets in 2022 and 2021 mainly included the effect of the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.S. and in 2023 mainly in the UK.

(CAMT). The CAMT is generally imposed at a rate of 15% on profits before tax. The CAMT is not expected to increase the bank's overall tax burden but may accelerate tax payments. The bank is subject to the CAMT rules starting in 2023. Deferred tax assets on unused tax credits in the preceding table include corporate alternative minimum tax credits of \u20ac 10 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities, after offsetting\n\n| in \u20ac m.                               | Dec 31, 2023   | Dec 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Presented as deferred tax assets      | 7,773          | 7,272          |\n| Presented as deferred tax liabilities | 546            | 650            |\n| Net deferred tax assets               | 7,227          | 6,622          |\n\nThe change in the balance of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities might not equal the deferred tax expense/(benefit). In general, this is due to (1) deferred taxes that are booked directly to equity, (2) the effects of exchange rate changes on tax assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than euro, (3) the acquisition and disposal of entities as part of ordinary activities and (4) the reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities which are presented otherwise on the face of the balance sheet as components of other assets and liabilities.",

This is based on management's assessment that it is probable that the respective entities will have taxable profits against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

        "page_content": "## 35 -Derivatives\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative contracts used by the Group include swaps, futures, forwards, options and other similar types of contracts. In the normal  course  of  business,  the  Group  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative  transactions  for  sales,  market-making  and  risk management purposes. The Group's objectives in using derivative instruments are to meet customers' risk management needs and to manage the Group's exposure to risks.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policy relating to derivatives and hedge accounting as described in Note 1 'Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates', all derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or non-trading purposes.\n\n## Derivatives held for sales and market-making purposes\n\n## Sales and market-making\n\nThe majority of the Group's derivatives transactions relate to sales and market-making activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants, enabling revenue to be generated based on spreads and volume.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group uses derivatives in order to reduce its exposure to market risks as part of its asset and liability management. This is  achieved  by  entering  into  derivatives  that  hedge  specific  portfolios  of  fixed  rate  financial  instruments  and  forecast transactions as well as strategic hedging against overall balance sheet exposures. The Group actively manages interest rate risk through, among other things, the use of derivative contracts. Utilization of derivative financial instruments is modified from time to time within prescribed limits in response to changing market conditions, as well as to changes in the characteristics and mix of the related assets and liabilities.\n\n## Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting if derivatives meet the specific criteria described in Note 1 'Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'.\n\nIn fair value hedge relationship, the Group uses primarily interest rate swaps and options, in order to protect itself against movements in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. In a cash flow hedge relationship, the Group uses interest rate swaps in order to protect itself against exposure to variability in interest rates. The Group enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps for hedges of translation adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of net investments in foreign operations into the reporting currency of the parent at period end spot rates.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps and options to manage its exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the re-pricing characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The interest rate swaps and options are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe Group manages its interest rate risk exposure on a portfolio basis with frequent changes in the portfolio due to the origination of new loans and bonds, repayments of existing loans and bonds, issuance of new funding liabilities and repayment of  existing  funding  liabilities.  Accordingly,  a  dynamic  hedging  accounting  approach  is  adopted  for  the  portfolio,  in  which individual hedge relationships are designated and de-designated on a more frequent basis (e.g. on a monthly basis).",

        "page_content": "The Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable  to  the  hedged  risk.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  can  be  attributed  to  differences  between  hedging instruments and hedged items:\n\n- -Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset, frequency of payment and callable features.\n- -Difference  in  the  discounting  rate  applied  to  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  taking  into  consideration differences in the reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n- -Derivatives used as hedging instrument with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group's portfolio fair value hedging  relationships include hedges of well-collateralized German fixed rate mortgages portfolios where the Group maintains headroom to avoid any hedge ineffectiveness that may arise from an increase in the default risk of the underlying mortgage portfolio. This also applies to the Group's portfolio fair value hedge relationships that include non-maturing deposits that the Group's customers may withdraw on demand. The stable nature of the Group's deposit volume (refer to Note 26) as well as a headroom means that Group has not observed any hedge ineffectiveness from the hedge accounting application. In the current year, the Group partly discontinued its macro cash flow program that includes a portfolio of corporate variable yielding loans as hedged item. This discontinuation was triggered by a rebalancing of the Group's hedge accounting designations and the Group has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness due to an increase in counterparty defaults or unexpected pre-payments in the corporate loan portfolio.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group manages its foreign currency risk (including U.S. dollar and British pound) from investments in foreign operation through net investment hedges using rolling foreign exchange forward strategy. In addition, the Group applies cash flow hedge accounting  for  specific  foreign  denominated  highly  probable  cash  flows  using  foreign  exchange  forward  instruments  as hedging instruments.\n\nAs the investments in foreign operations are only hedged to the extent of the notional amount of the hedging derivative instrument the Group generally does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign operations.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  are  limited  to  situations  where  derivatives  with  a  non-zero  fair  value  at inception date of the hedging relationship are used as hedging instrument, or where the spot foreign currency risk has been designated as hedged risk, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item. Similarly, for cash flow hedge accounting applications  the  foreign  exchange  forward  instruments  generally  match  the  terms  of  the  underlying  highly  probable transactions such that the Group does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness in such hedge relationships.\n\n## Hedge Accounting and Interest Rate Benchmarks\n\nThe table below shows the Group's hedge accounting relationships impacted by the IASB Benchmark Reform amendments, the significant interest rate benchmarks the Group is exposed to which are subject to expected future reform, and the nominal amounts of the derivative hedging instruments as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As at December 31, 2023 and as at December 31, 2022, there were no hedge relationships with hedging instruments, hedged items or the hedged risk being an IBOR benchmark which ceased to be quoted in early 2022. The derivative hedging instruments provide a close approximation to the extent of the risk exposure the Group manages through hedge accounting relationships.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n| in \u20ac m.          | Dec 31, 2023   Notional   | Dec 31, 2022  Notional   |\n|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge |                           |                          |\n| CHF LIBOR        | 0                         |                          |\n| GBP LIBOR        | 0                         |                          |\n| JPY LIBOR        | 0                         |                          |\n| USD LIBOR        | 0                         | 12,281                   |",

As a result, changes of the hedged item's value used for hedge effectiveness are not fully recorded in equity if it exceeds the hedging instrument's fair value changes used for hedge effectiveness. Consequently, hedge ineffectiveness recorded within P&L does not always reconcile to the difference between the changes of the hedged item's value used for hedge effectiveness and the hedging instrument's fair value changes used for hedge effectiveness.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the longest term cash flow hedge matures in 2035.\n\nThe  financial  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are  recognized  as  Loans  at  amortized  cost  in  the  Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Net investment hedge accounting\n\n## Derivatives held as net investment hedges\n\n|                                                     |               | Dec 31, 2023     | Nominal          | 2023    Fair Value  changes used  for hedge   |                 |                  | Dec 31, 2022    Nominal   | 2022  Fair Value  changes used  for hedge  effectiveness   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

A structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. An example is when voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements.\n\nA structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes:\n\n- -Restricted activities\n- -A narrow and well-defined objective\n- -Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support\n- -Financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches)\n\nThe principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide market liquidity  for  clients  through  securitizing  financial  assets.  Structured  entities  may  be  established  as  corporations,  trusts  or partnerships.  Structured  entities  generally  finance  the  purchase  of  assets  by  issuing  debt  and  equity  securities  that  are collateralized  by  and/or  indexed  to  the  assets  held  by  the  structured  entities.  The  debt  and  equity  securities  issued  by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination.\n\nStructured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by the Group, as discussed in Note 1 'Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates'.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nThe  Group  has  contractual  arrangements  which  may  require  it  to  provide  financial  support  to  the  following  types  of consolidated structured entities.\n\n## Securitization vehicles\n\nThe Group uses securitization vehicles for funding purchase of diversified pool of assets. The Group provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facility. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding loan commitments to these entities.\n\n## Funds\n\nThe Group may provide funding and liquidity facility or guarantees to funds consolidated by the group. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional value of the liquidity facilities and guarantees provided by the Group to such funds was \u20ac 1.1 billion and \u20ac 1.1 billion, respectively.\n\nDeutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to consolidated structured entities.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThese are entities which are not consolidated because the Group does not control them through voting rights, contract, funding agreements, or other means. The extent of the Group's interests to unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entities.\n\nBelow is a description of the Group's involvements in unconsolidated structured entities by type.\n\n## Repackaging and investment entities\n\nRepackaging and investment entities are established to meet clients' investment needs through the combination of securities and derivatives. These entities are not consolidated by the Group because the Group does not have power to influence the returns obtained from the entities. These entities are usually set up to provide a certain investment return pre-agreed with the investor, and the Group is not able to change the investment strategy or return during the life of the transaction.",

        "page_content": "## Third party funding entities\n\nThe Group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the form of funding entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. The group's involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments.\n\nThe vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrowers where the borrowers have the ability to decide whether to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. In such cases, where borrowers can decide to continue or terminate the financing, the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle.\n\n## Securitization Vehicles\n\nThe Group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed income securities, corporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and credit card receivables). The vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities, the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles.\n\nThe Group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles and provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facilities. The Group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicles. The securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the Group are those where the Group does not hold the power or ability to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the entity.\n\n## Funds\n\nThe Group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. The Group also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties or the bank may act as fund manager, custodian or some other capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities to both bank sponsored and third party funds. The funding provided is collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund.\n\nThe Group does not consolidate funds when Deutsche Bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the ability to direct the activities of the fund.\n\n## Other\n\nThese are Deutsche Bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. These entities are not consolidated by the Group when the bank does not hold power over the decision making of these entities.\n\n## Income derived from involvement with structured entities\n\nThe Group earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment management service in relation to funds. Interest income is recognized on the funding provided to structured entities. Any trading revenue as a result of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is recognized in 'Net gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and non-contractual involvement that exposes the bank to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entities. Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments, liquidity facilities, guarantees and certain derivative instruments in which the Group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities.\n\nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the structured entities. For example, when the bank purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entity whose purpose and design is to  pass  through  credit  risk  to  investors,  the  bank  is  providing  the  variability  of  returns  to  the  entity  rather  than absorbing variability. The purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the purpose of the table below.\n\n## Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives and off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS 12, as interpreted by Deutsche Bank, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts or its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the Group because it does not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges, nor the probability of such losses being incurred. At December 31, 2023, the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were \u20ac 117 billion, \u20ac 315 billion and \u20ac 26 billion respectively. At December 31, 2022, the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were \u20ac 457 billion, \u20ac 397 billion and \u20ac 28 billion respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Size of structured entities\n\nThe Group provides a different measure for size of structured entities depending on their type. The following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of structured entities:\n\n- -Funds - Net asset value or assets under management where the bank holds fund units and notional of derivatives when the bank's interest comprises of derivatives\n- -Securitizations - notional of notes in issue (excluding interest only and excess notes where applicable) when the Group derives its interests through notes its holds and notional of derivatives when the bank's interests is in the form of derivatives\n- -Third party funding entities -Total assets in entities\n- -Repackaging and investment entities - Fair value of notes in issue\n\nFor third party funding entities, size information is not publicly available, therefore the Group has disclosed the greater of the collateral received/pledged or the notional of the exposure the bank has to the entity.\n\nBased on the above definitions, the total size of structured entities is \u20ac 2,329 billion, of which the majority of \u20ac 1,223 billion is from Funds. In 2022, it was \u20ac 2,723 billion and \u20ac 1,138 billion respectively.\n\nThe following  table  shows,  by  type  of  structured  entity,  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group's  interests  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. The carrying amounts presented below do not reflect the true variability of returns faced by the Group because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges.\n\n## Carrying amounts

December 31, 2022 of \u20ac 8.9 billion and \u20ac 9.9 billion are comprised primarily of \u20ac 2.8 billion and \u20ac 3.2 billion in securitizations and \u20ac 3.3 billion and \u20ac 3.7 billion in funds structured entities respectively. The Group's interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund units these are typically in regard to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover, the credit risk arising from loans made to third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received.\n\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss includes reverse repurchase agreements to funds which comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities.\n\nLoans  as  of  December 31,  2023,  and  December 31,  2022,  consist  of  \u20ac 116.7 billion  and  \u20ac 118.6 billion  investment  in securitization tranches and financing to third party funding entities. The Group's financing to third party funding entities is collateralized by the assets in those structured entities.\n\nOther assets as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of \u20ac 14.7 billion and \u20ac 14.7 billion, respectively, consist primarily of cash margin balances.\n\nPending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical customer supplier relationships out of e.g., brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Bank's exposures to structured entities.\n\n## Financial support\n\nDeutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to unconsolidated structured entities.",

Additionally, the use of the Deutsche Bank name for the structured entity indicates that the bank has acted as a sponsor.\n\nThe  gross  revenues  from  sponsored  entities  where  the  bank  did  not  hold  an  interest  as  of  December 31, 2023,  and December 31, 2022, were \u20ac 38 million and \u20ac 226 million respectively. Instances where the bank does not hold an interest in an unconsolidated sponsored structured entity include cases where any seed capital or funding to the structured entity has already been repaid in full to the Group during the year. This amount does not take into account the impacts of hedges and is recognized in Net gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The aggregated carrying amounts of assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in 2023 were \u20ac 1.7 billion for securitization and \u20ac 1.9 billion for repackaging and investment entities. In 2022, they were \u20ac 3.4 billion for securitization and \u20ac 1.2 billion for repackaging and investment entities.\n\n## 39 -Current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\n## Asset and liability line items by amounts recovered or settled within or after one year\n\n## Asset items as of December 31, 2023\n\n|                                                                          | Amounts to be recovered or settled   | Amounts to be recovered or settled   | Total        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|\n| in \u20ac m.                                                                  | within one year                      | after one year                       | Dec 31, 2023 |\n| Cash and central bank balances                                           | 178,416                              | 0                                    | 178,416      |\n| Interbank balances (w/o central banks)                                   | 5,535                                | 606                                  | 6,140        |\n| Central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements | 8,263                                | 6,462                                | 14,725       |\n| Securities borrowed                                                      | 32                                   | 6                                    | 39           |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                    | 459,604                              | 5,648                                | 465,252      |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income        | 7,393                                | 28,152                               | 35,546       |\n| Equity method investments                                                | 0                                    | 1,013                                | 1,013        |\n| Loans at amortized cost                                                  | 127,483                              | 346,222                              | 473,705      |\n| Property and equipment                                                   | 0                                    | 6,185                                | 6,185        |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets                                     | 0                                    | 7,327                                | 7,327        |\n| Other assets                                                             | 93,090                               | 21,607                               | 114,697      |\n| Assets for current tax                                                   | 1,084                                | 429                                  | 1,513        |\n| Total assets before deferred tax assets                                  | 880,900                              | 423,657                              | 1,304,557    |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                      |                                      |                                      | 7,773        |\n| Total assets                                                             |                                      |                                      | 1,312,331    |",

        "page_content": "## 41 -Regulatory capital information\n\n## General definitions\n\nThe  calculation  of  Deutsche  Bank's  own  funds  incorporates  the  capital  requirements  following  the  'Regulation  (EU)  No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions' CRR and the 'Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions'  'CRD',  which  have  been  further  amended  with subsequent Regulations and Directives. The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as well as in the section 'Development of risk-weighted assets' is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation.\n\nThis section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to the CRR and the German Banking Act ('Kreditwesengesetz' or 'KWG'). Therein not included are insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector.\n\nThe total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2023 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\nCET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to regulatory  adjustments  (i.e.,  prudential  filters  and  deductions),  as  well  as  minority  interests  qualifying  for  inclusion  in consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains on  sale,  cash  flow  hedges  and  changes  in  the  value  of  own  liabilities,  and  additional  value  adjustments.  CET  1  capital deductions for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of financial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.\n\nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a trigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem, institution must have full dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc.\n\nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature.\n\n## Capital instruments\n\nThe Management Board was authorized by the 2022 Annual General Meeting to buy, on or before April 30, 2027, shares of up to 10% of the share capital at the time this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time the authorization was exercised. As at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to a volume of up to 206.6 million shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, including derivatives with a volume of up to 2% of the total share capital with a maturity exceeding 18 months. During the period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until the 2023 Annual General Meeting, 36.3 million shares were purchased for equity compensation purposes in the same period or upcoming periods. Thereof, 22.7 million shares were purchased by exercising  call  options.  In  addition,  30.2 million  new  call  options  were  purchased  for  equity  compensation  purposes  in upcoming periods. The number of shares held in Treasury amounted to 5.0 million as of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. These shares were held for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.",

As at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to 204 million shares.

These authorizations replaced the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2023 Annual General Meeting until December  31,  2023,  45.5 million  shares  were  purchased  for  cancellation  with  the  purpose  of  distributing  capital  to shareholders. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 48.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Thereof 45.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.7 million shares relates to shares to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.\n\nSince the 2017 Annual General Meeting, renewed at the 2021 Annual General Meeting, and as of December 31, 2023, authorized capital available to the Management Board is \u20ac 2,560 million (1,000 million shares).\n\nSince the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Management Board is authorized to issue participatory notes and other hybrid debt  securities  that  fulfill  the  regulatory  requirements  to  qualify  as  Additional  Tier  1  capital  with  an  equivalent  value  of \u20ac 9.0 billion  on  or  before  April  30,  2027.  Deutsche  Bank  issued  \u20ac 1.25 billion  new  AT1  notes  under  this  authorization  in November 2022.\n\nThe current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until December 31, 2021. In 2023, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2023, which resulted in no material difference between the 'fully loaded' and 'transitional' amounts.\n\nBased on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of \u20ac 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2023. In 2023, the bank did not issue or redeem AT1 notes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to \u20ac 8.6 billion (nominal value of \u20ac 11.5 billion). In 2023, the bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value U.S. $ 1.5 billion (equivalent amount of \u20ac 1.4 billion) and a notional of \u20ac 132.5 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy requirements in 2023.",

    |\n\n## Capital management\n\nDeutsche Bank's Treasury function manages solvency, capital adequacy, leverage, and bail-in capacity ratios at Group level and locally in each region, as applicable. Treasury implements Deutsche Bank's capital strategy, which itself is developed by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group Asset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders' equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank's sound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The bank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank's overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance.\n\nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying back Deutsche Bank's issuances below par.\n\nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank's foreign subsidiaries and branches is either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.",

        "page_content": "## Resource limit setting\n\nUsage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.\n\nTarget resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank's annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank's CET 1 and Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank's quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that are based on the strategic  plan but  adjusted  for  market  conditions  and  the  short-term  outlook.  Limits  are  enforced  through  a  close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism.\n\nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank's CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined contribution of each segment to the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group's Leverage ratio and the Group's Capital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The Group's Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group's overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.\n\nMost of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank's branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank's capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank's  branches  and subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution.\n\nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank's Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank's investment objective to protect the capital base and distribution capacity of the bank.",

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, which is combined with the management report of the Bank, for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we  have  not  audited  the  last  paragraph  of  the  section  'Risk  management  principles  (chapter  risk  report)'  of  the  group management report regarding management's statement on the risk management framework and internal control system and the content of the combined 'Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sec. 289f and 315d HGB' which is published on the website stated in the group management report and is part of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, and\n- -the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. We do not express an opinion on the last paragraph of the section risk management principles (chapter 'risk report') of the group management report regarding management's statement on the risk management framework and internal control system referred to above or the content of the combined statement on corporate governance referred to above.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317  HGB  and  the  EU  Audit  Regulation  (No  537/2014,  referred  to  subsequently  as  \"EU  Audit  Regulation\")  and  in compliance  with  German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW).

These  matters  were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## 1. Valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nManagement uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets. The Group held level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value of EUR 25,599 million and EUR 10,856 million as of 31 December 2023. The relevant financial instruments are reported within financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial instruments and related inputs that are not quoted in active markets include structured derivatives valued using complex models; more-complex or illiquid OTC derivatives; distressed debt; highly-structured bonds; illiquid loans, including those relating to commercial real estate; credit spreads used to determine valuation adjustments; and other significant inputs which cannot be observed for financial instruments with longer-dated maturities.\n\nAs the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets is based to a high degree on management's assumptions and judgments due to the complex nature of the valuation techniques and models being utilized and the unobservability of the significant inputs used, this is a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  controls  over management's processes to determine fair value of financial instruments and determination of significant unobservable inputs therein. This includes controls relating to independent price verification; independent validation of valuation models, including assessment of model limitations; monitoring of valuation model usage; and calculation of fair value adjustments.\n\nWe evaluated the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and tested the significant inputs used in those models. We performed an independent revaluation of a sample of derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value that are not quoted in active markets, using independent models and inputs. We also independently assessed the reasonableness of a sample of proxy inputs used by comparing to market data sources and evaluated their relevance to the related financial instruments.\n\nIn addition, we evaluated the methodology and inputs used by management in determining fair value adjustments against the requirements of IFRS 13 and performed recalculations for a sample of these valuation adjustments using our own independent data and methodology.\n\nWe involved internal financial instruments valuation specialists in the procedures related to valuation models, independent revaluation and fair value adjustments.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the valuation techniques, models and methodologies used in the measurement of fair value is provided in notes 1 and 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group recognized an allowance for credit losses of EUR 5,726 million, with EUR 1,358 million relating to stage 1 and stage 2 allowances.\n\nThe estimated probabilities of default (PD) used in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses on non-defaulted financial  instruments  (IFRS 9  stage 1  and  stage 2)  are  based  on  historical  information,  combined  with  current  economic developments  and  forward-looking  macroeconomic  forecasts  (e.g.,  gross  domestic  product  and  unemployment  rates). Statistical techniques are used to transform the base scenario for future macroeconomic developments into multiple scenarios. These scenarios are the basis for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are used in the calculation of expected credit losses.\n\nGiven the economic uncertainties regarding pronounced movements in interest rates, current geopolitical conflicts and other sources of volatility impacting macroeconomic variables, the estimation of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. To reflect these uncertainties, management must assess whether to make adjustments to its standard process for inclusion of macroeconomic variables into the expected credit loss model and forecasting methods, either by adjusting the macroeconomic variables or through the inclusion of management overlays.\n\nIn view of the significant holdings of non-defaulted financial instruments subject to impairment under IFRS 9 and the economic uncertainty and significant use of judgment, we consider the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, and any adjustments thereof, to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the processes implemented by management, assessed the design of the controls over the selection, determination, monitoring and validation of forward-looking information in respect of the requirements under IFRS 9, and tested their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe evaluated management's review of its expected credit loss model and forecasting methods conducted through the model validation process. Furthermore, we evaluated the methods used to include the selected variables in the baseline scenario and the derivation of the multiple scenarios.\n\nWe assessed the baseline macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them with macroeconomic forecasts published by external sources.\n\nWe also evaluated the methodology applied by management to determine whether to adjust its standard process for inclusion of macroeconomic variables or to adjust the model results through management overlays. In doing so, we assessed the results of management's sensitivity analysis and compared the macroeconomic variables used to our own benchmark analysis. We also assessed that the adjustments were included in the calculation of expected credit losses according to management's methodology.\n\nTo assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, we involved internal credit risk modelling specialists.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the inclusion of forward-looking information into the model-based calculation of expected credit losses and their adjustments for stages 1 and 2 is provided in notes 1 and 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Expected credit losses for defaulted commercial real estate loans\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs  of  31  December  2023,  the  Group  recognized  loan  exposures  of  EUR 38,192 million  relating  to  the  non-recourse commercial real estate loans business with corresponding allowances of EUR 606 million.\n\nIdentifying  and  calculating  the  expected  credit  losses  for  defaulted  loan  exposures  involves  various  assumptions  and estimation inputs, particularly regarding the solvency of the borrower, expectations of future cash flows, observable market prices and expected proceeds from the realization of collateral.\n\nIn  view  of  an  increase  in  defaulted  loan  exposures  relating  to  the  commercial  real  estate  business  and  the  economic uncertainty and significant use of judgment, we consider expected credit losses (ECL) for defaulted commercial real estate loans as a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the processes for identifying and calculating expected credit losses for borrowers in the commercial real estate loans business. We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to credit risk rating, the application of default criteria and transfer to stage 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and the calculation of the expected credit loss.\n\nWe evaluated the criteria used by management to determine defaulted loans in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nFor a sample of commercial real estate loans we analyzed the application of default criteria used for ECL-staging. For loans classified as stage 3 we assessed the significant assumptions concerning the estimated future cash flows from the loan exposures, by assessing the collateral value, the solvency of the borrower and the publicly available market and industry forecasts. We searched for and evaluated information that corroborates or contradicts management's forecasted assumptions. We also tested the arithmetical accuracy of the expected credit loss calculated for defaulted exposures.\n\nWe involved internal specialists to assess the valuation of commercial real estate collateral on a sample basis.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the expected credit losses for defaulted commercial real estate loans.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the Group's commercial real estate loans business is included in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as the section 'IFRS 9 Impairment' in the Risk Report (Combined Management Report), which is an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4. Measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management cash-generating unit\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs  of  31 December  2023,  the  Group  reported  goodwill  of  EUR 2,849 million  that  was  exclusively  allocated  to  its  Asset Management cash-generating unit (CGU).\n\nFor purposes of the impairment test the recoverable amount of the Asset Management CGU is calculated using the discounted cash flow model. In this context, significant assumptions are made regarding the earnings projections and the discount rate. The discount rate is derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nAs the measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU is based on a high degree of judgment due to the earnings projections and discount rate contained in the discounted cash flow model this is a key audit matter.",

In this respect, we also obtained an understanding of management's controls regarding the earnings projections and the discount rate, assessed the design of such controls and tested their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe analyzed the significant assumptions described above with a focus on significant changes compared with the prior year. In this regard, we assessed the consistency and reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model by comparing them with external market expectations.\n\nIn analyzing the expected future cash flows of the Asset Management CGU, we compared the earnings projections with the prior fiscal year's projections and with the actual results achieved and evaluated any significant deviations. Furthermore, we assessed the discount rate by comparing it to a range of externally available forecasts.\n\nTo assess the above assumptions made in the recoverability of goodwill we involved internal business valuation specialists.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the measurement of the goodwill for the Asset Management CGU.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the measurement of goodwill is provided in notes 1 and 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 5. Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group reported net deferred tax assets of EUR 7,227 million.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on the estimation of the ability to utilize unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences against potential  future taxable  income.  This  estimate is  based,  among  others,  on assumptions regarding forecasted operating results based upon the approved business plan.\n\nIn light of the use of judgment in estimation of future taxable income and the ability to use tax losses, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the process to determine whether deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses are identified in different jurisdictions and measured in accordance with the provisions of tax law and rules for accounting for deferred taxes under IAS 12, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the related controls.\n\nWe tested the assumptions used to develop and allocate elements of the approved business plan as a basis for estimating the future taxable income of the relevant group companies and tax groups.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the recognition of deferred tax assets by analyzing the key assumptions made in estimating future taxable  income.  We  assessed  the  estimates  made  in  the  forecasted  operating  results  by  comparing  the  underlying  key assumptions with historical and prospective data available externally. We compared the historical forecasts with the actual results.  In  addition,  we  assessed  the  estimated  tax  adjustments  and  we  performed  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  utilization periods of the respective deferred tax assets.\n\nTo assess the assumptions used in the recoverability of the deferred taxes, we involved our tax professionals and internal business valuation specialists.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition and measurement of the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nInformation on the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is provided in notes 1 and 34 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

IT Access and Change Management in the financial reporting\n\n## Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter\n\nThe accuracy of the Group's financial reporting is highly dependent on the reliability and the continuity of the used information technology due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily.\n\nGiven the high dependency on reliable and continuing data processing and given the pervasive nature of IT controls on the internal control system, we consider IT Access and Change Management in the Group's financial reporting as a key audit matter.\n\n## Auditor's response\n\nWe assessed the IT control environment including the IT general controls as well as the IT application controls relevant to the Group's financial reporting. Our procedures also covered the changes during the year on the current IT control environment.\n\nMoreover, we tested the operating effectiveness of prevent and detect IT general controls related to user access management and  change  management  across  applications,  databases  and  operating  systems.  Additionally,  we  tested  IT  application controls over automated data processing, data feeds and interfaces. Our audit procedures related to IT access management included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  user  access  provisioning  and  removal,  privileged  user  access,  periodic  access  right recertifications, system security settings and user authentication controls.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  IT  change  management  included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  evaluating  if  changes  in  the production environment were tested and approved prior to implementation and the ability to deploy changes was restricted to authorized users.\n\nTo  assess  the  IT  Access  and  Change  Management  in  the  Group's  financial  reporting  process,  we  involved  internal professionals who have particular expertise in the area of IT audits.\n\nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the IT access and change management in the group's financial reporting.'\n\n## Reference to related disclosures\n\nFor a general description of internal controls over the financial reporting, we refer to the combined management report in section 'Internal Control over Financial Reporting'.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for the Report of the Supervisory Board.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the executive directors and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects,  with  IFRSs  as  adopted  by  the  EU  and  the  additional  requirements  of  German  commercial  law  pursuant  to Sec. 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  (i.e.,  fraudulent  financial  reporting  and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements,  complies  with  German  legal  requirements,  and  appropriately  presents  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German  legal  requirements,  and  to  be  able  to  provide  sufficient  appropriate  evidence  for  the  assertions  in  the  group management report.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  group's  financial  reporting  process  for  the  preparation  of  the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and  the  knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit,  complies  with  the  German  legal  requirements  and  appropriately  presents  the opportunities  and  risks  of  future  development,  as  well  as  to  issue  an  auditor's  report  that  includes  our  opinions  on  the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  this  group management report.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions.

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions.

There is a substantial unavoidable risk  that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.",

The Compensation Report describes the fundamental features of the compensation systems for Deutsche Bank's Management Board and Supervisory Board and provides information on the compensation granted and owed by Deutsche Bank in the 2023 financial year to each incumbent or former member of the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Compensation Report fulfills the current legal and regulatory requirements, in particular of Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act and the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions ( Institutsverg\u00fctungsverordnung - InstVV) and takes into account the recommendations set out in the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). It is also in compliance with the applicable requirements of the accounting rules for capital market-oriented companies (German Commercial Code (HGB), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)) as well as the guidelines issued by the working group Guidelines for Sustainable Management Board Remuneration Systems.\n\n## Employee Compensation Report\n\nThis part of the compensation report discloses information with regard to the compensation system and structure that applies to the employees in Deutsche Bank Group.

        "page_content": "## Compensation of the Management Board\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n2023 was another year of extraordinary macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainty, in which Deutsche Bank provided stability and support for its clients. Deutsche Bank's Global Hausbank strategy and diversified universal banking model were once again put to the test and proved resilient and robust, delivering the best annual pre-tax profit result in 16 years. With an increase in revenues of 6% to almost \u20ac 29 billion, Deutsche Bank grew faster than expected.\n\nDeutsche Bank's performance in 2023 was set against a backdrop of continuing high inflation, slower economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty with the war in Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza. With its strategic realignment in 2019 and subsequent transformation, Deutsche Bank laid the foundation for growth and sustainable profitability. In 2023, Deutsche  Bank  significantly  increased  its  shareholder  distributions  while  maintaining  cost  discipline  and  continuing  to strengthen its capital base.\n\nThe Supervisory Board considered stakeholders' perspectives very carefully when making compensation decisions. These decisions reflect  its  pay-for-performance  philosophy  while  taking  into  account  individual  and  collective  financial  and  nonfinancial performances aligned to the execution of the Global Hausbank strategy with appropriate regard for risks and controls. As part of its performance assessment, the Supervisory Board also dealt in detail with the problems and negative effects that arose in connection with Project Unity (IT migration of Postbank customer accounts to the Deutsche Bank platform) and, as part  of  consequence  management,  took  into  account  the  different  individual  responsibilities  of  the  members  of  the Management Board for this matter and made appropriate reductions for the determination of their target achievement levels (cut in Short-Term Award achievement levels).\n\nAll compensation decisions are made within the boundaries of multiple regulatory requirements. In this regard, Management Board compensation and the pay-out schedules of variable compensation components are limited in several ways. Due to the requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision of the General Meeting in May  2014,  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  variable  compensation  is  generally  limited  to  1:2  (cap  rule).  For  this  reason,  the  fixed compensation of Deutsche Bank Management Board members is relatively high compared to other DAX companies that are not subject to this regulation.\n\nThe Compensation Control Committee of Deutsche Bank regularly reviews the compensation system of the Management Board members with regard to market trends and investor feedback. As a result of the review process in 2023, points of improvement were identified. These are now reflected in a redesigned compensation system, which will be submitted to the General Meeting for approval in May 2024 with effect from 2024 onwards. The complexity of the compensation system has been reduced by limiting  the  number  of  objectives,  which  leads  to  significantly  increased  transparency.  To  consider  the feedback of shareholders, a forward-looking assessment period rather than the previous backward-looking perspective will be used from now on for the performance measurement of the Long-Term Incentive. With this change, we aim to foster a longterm focus and thus the sustainable development of the company. To further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment of  the  compensation  of  Deutsche  Bank,  the  target  achievement  regarding  the  Relative  Total  Shareholder  Return  will  be assessed based on a more ambitious approach based on the percentile rank of Deutsche Bank compared to the international banks in the peer group.\n\nFor further details regarding the new Management Board compensation system, please refer to the Outlook section of the Compensation Report 2023.",

The Compensation Control Committee supports the Supervisory Board in its tasks of designing and monitoring the implementation of the system and prepares proposals for resolutions for the Supervisory Board. As necessary, the Compensation Control Committee issues recommendations for the Supervisory Board to make adjustments to the system. In the case of significant changes, but at least every four years, the compensation system for the Management Board is submitted to the General Meeting for approval in accordance with Section 120a (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act. The compensation system was last approved by the General Meeting 2021 by a majority of 97.76%.\n\nOn the basis of the approved compensation system, the Supervisory Board sets the target total compensation for each Management Board member for the respective financial year, while taking into account the scope and complexity of the respective Management Board member's functional responsibilities, the length of service of the Management Board member on the Management Board as well as the company's financial situation. In the process, the Supervisory Board also considers the customary market compensation, also based on both horizontal and vertical comparisons, and sets the upper limit for total compensation (maximum compensation) (additional information is provided in the section 'Appropriateness of Management Board compensation and compliance with the set maximum compensation').\n\n## Guiding principle: Alignment of Management Board compensation to corporate strategy\n\nDeutsche Bank aims to make a positive contribution to its clients, employees, investors and society in general by fostering economic growth and social progress. Deutsche Bank offers its clients solutions and provides an active contribution to foster the creation of value by its clients. This approach is also intended to ensure that Deutsche Bank is competitive and profitable and can operate on the basis of a strong capital and liquidity position. Deutsche Bank is committed to a corporate culture that appropriately aligns risks and revenues.\n\nAt the Annual Media Conference in February 2024, Deutsche Bank confirmed its strategic goals for the Group for the period up to 2025. With its four well-balanced and mutually reinforcing businesses, Deutsche Bank's business model provides a stable and promising foundation for capital-efficient business growth, a predictable revenue mix, prudent risk management and a strong balance sheet. Deutsche Bank has a clear path and is right on track in executing its Global Hausbank strategy for the Group for the period up to 2025 with the aim of sustainably profitable growth and shareholder returns. Since revenues have surpassed the Bank's expectations in the past years, the previous target for 2025 has been raised compared to the Bank's ambition announced at the Investor Deep Dive in March 2022. For the period between 2021 and 2025, the adjusted target is a compound annual revenues growth rate of between 5.5% and 6.5%, raised from the Bank's previous expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% and leading to project revenues of approximately \u20ac 32 billion in the financial year 2025. At the same time, cost discipline remains a high priority. Further efficiency measures were implemented in 2023 to bring the cost/income ratio below 62.5% by 2025 and free up capacity for investments and improve operational leverage in order to generate an attractive Return on Tangible Equity of above 10%. The capital distribution objectives are to be achieved through a combination of dividends and share buy-backs with the aim of a payout ratio of 50% from financial year 2024 onwards. The Bank will continue to focus on conduct and controls and follow a clear management agenda to change the way of working, to become even more innovative and remain an employer of choice.\n\nIn the interests of the shareholders, the Management Board compensation system is aligned to the business strategy as well as  the  sustainable  and  long-term  development  of  Deutsche  Bank  and  provides  suitable  incentives  for  a  consistent achievement of the set targets. Through the composition of total compensation comprising fixed and variable compensation components, through the assessment of performance over short-term and long-term periods and through the consideration of relevant,  challenging  performance  parameters,  the  implementation  of  the  Group  strategy  and  the  alignment  with  the sustainable and long-term performance of the Group are rewarded in a clear and understandable manner. The structure of the targets and objectives therefore comprises a balanced mix of both financial and non-financial parameters and indicators.\n\nThrough the structuring of the compensation system, the members of the Management Board get incentivized by achieving the targets and objectives linked to Deutsche Bank's strategy, when working individually and as a team continually towards the long-term positive development of Deutsche Bank, without taking on disproportionately high risks. The Supervisory Board thus ensures there is always a strong link between compensation and performance in line with shareholder interests ('pay for performance').",

        "page_content": "## Compensation principles\n\nThe design of the compensation system and thus the assessment of individual compensation amounts are based on the compensation principles outlined below. The Supervisory Board takes them into consideration when adopting its resolutions in this context:\n\n| Corporate strategy                      | The compensation system for the Management Board members is closely linked to Deutsche Bank's  strategy, thereby focusing their work on its implementation and the long-term positive development of the  Group, without taking disproportionate risks.                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders' interests                 | The interests of shareholders are always taken into account when designing the specific structure of the  compensation system, determining individual compensation amounts and structuring the means of  compensation allocation and delivery.                                                                                |\n| Individual and collective objectives    | Setting individual, divisional and collective objectives fosters not only the sustainable and long-term  development of each of the business divisions, infrastructure areas or regions the Management Board  members are responsible for, but also the performance of the Management Board as a collective  management body. |\n| Long-term perspective                   | A long-term link to Deutsche Bank's performance is secured by setting a greater percentage of long-term  objectives in comparison to short-term objectives and by granting variable compensation exclusively in  deferred form and mostly as share-based compensation with vesting and holding periods of up to seven  years. |\n| Sustainability                          | Objectives in accordance with Deutsche Bank's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy  provide incentives for acting responsibly, also in the context of sustainability, and thus make an important  contribution to Deutsche Bank's long-term performance.                                                       |\n| Appropriateness and upper limits (caps) | The appropriateness of the compensation amounts is ensured through the review of the compensation  based on a horizontal comparison with peers and a vertical comparison with the workforce as well as  suitable compensation caps on the achievable variable compensation and maximum compensation.                          |\n| Transparency                            | By avoiding unnecessary complexity in the structures and through clear and understandable reporting,  the transparency of the compensation system is increased in accordance with the expectations of  investors and the public as well as the regulatory requirements.                                                       |\n| Governance                              | The structuring of the compensation system and the assessment to determine the individual  compensation take place within the framework of the statutory and regulatory requirements.                                                                                                                                         |",

        "page_content": "## Compensation-related developments in 2023\n\n## Development of business and alignment of Management Board compensation to corporate strategy in 2023\n\nManagement Board compensation is closely aligned to Deutsche Bank's strategic targets. All the individual and collective objectives agreed with the Management Board members as well as their assessment parameters for the 2023 financial year were discussed by the Compensation Control Committee at the beginning of the year and subsequently resolved on by the Supervisory Board. The objectives serve overall in fostering the strategic transformation of the Group. The achievement levels determined for the objectives for the 2023 financial year at the beginning of the year 2024 reflect the extent to which the individual objectives were achieved and thus contributed to the Bank's performance.\n\nSince 2019 the management team has successfully transformed Deutsche Bank. By refocusing the Bank's business around its core strengths, it has become significantly more profitable, better balanced and more cost-efficient. Thanks to the disciplined execution of its strategy, the Bank has been able to serve its clients through highly challenging conditions in a volatile world, proving its resilience with strong risk discipline and sound capital management.\n\nProfit before tax amounted to \u20ac 5.7 billion at the end of 2023. This is a slight increase of 2% over the previous year and the highest in sixteen years despite more than \u20ac 1 billion non-operating costs. Post-tax return on Tangible Equity fell over the course of last year to 7.4% due to tax effects in 2022 and 2023, whereby a greater positive impact was seen in 2022. Revenues increased by 6% versus 2022 to \u20ac 28.9 billion euros, driven by the rise in global interest rates and in particular by the success of the Bank's broad client base with an increase in business, especially in the Corporate and Private Banks, which saw the highest revenue growth rate in 2023. At the same time, Deutsche Bank managed to keep adjusted costs nearly stable at \u20ac 20.6 billion, with a consistent cost/income ratio of 75% for the full year.\n\nReflecting the profitability of all business segments in 2023, the Corporate and the Private Bank were the most important growth drivers. Both divisions achieved record profits. Corporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 7.7 billion in 2023, up 22% yearon-year.  All  Corporate  Bank  business  areas  achieved  double-digit  growth,  while  innovative  product  developments  and investments in capacities for future business generated positive effects. Private Bank net revenues were \u20ac 9.6 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Adjusted for specific items, such as the sale of the financial sales organization in Italy, Private Bank revenues even increased by 10%. This was primarily due to a strong deposit business with improved margins. Growth was driven in particular by the Private Clients Bank Germany, where revenues were 14% higher than in the previous year. Adjusted for the specific items, the International Private Clients Bank achieved revenues growth of 3%. In the Investment Bank, revenues totaled EUR 9.2 billion, 9% below the very high level of 2022. Revenues in the Origination and Advisory business increased by 25%, in particular due to the bond issuing business and the non-repeat of mark-to-market losses on funded and unfunded commitments  in  leveraged  debt  capital  markets.  Through  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  the  leading  UK  corporate  broker, investments were made in customer advisory services in order to generate higher commission and fee income in the long term.\n\nThe 2023 results demonstrate the benefits of Deutsche Bank's transformation efforts. The Bank delivered revenues growth in its core businesses and continued cost discipline. The risk provisions are in line with the Bank's guidance, despite challenging conditions. Focused de-risking of the balance sheet has contributed to the solid Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.7%.\n\nThe individual objectives are bundled in the short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) and account for a share of 40% of the target total variable compensation. The Supervisory Board determined an achievement level for these components for the 2023 financial year between 61.52% and 116.38%. The performance of the Management Board as a collective body is reflected in the long-term component (Long-Term Award (LTA)), which accounts for a share of 60% of the target total variable compensation. Overall, the achievement level of the collective objectives based solely on the 2023 financial year was 73.69%. This achievement level accounts for 60% of the Long-Term Award to be granted for the 2023 financial year. As achievement levels for prior years (at 30% from 2022 and 10% from 2021) also affected the Long-Term Award for the 2023 financial year, the achievement level for this component for the 2023 financial year was 77.53% based on the weighted achievement levels of the three financial years. Details on the individual achievement levels are presented as an overview in this report under the heading 'Application of the compensation system in the financial year'.",

        "page_content": "## Changes on the Management Board and Compensation Decisions in 2023\n\nWith effect from June 1 and July 1, 2023, respectively the Supervisory Board resolved changes in the functional responsibilities assigned to individual Management Board members. Claudio de Sanctis was appointed member of the Management Board with effect from July 1, 2023, for a period of three years. Christiana Riley left the Management Board at the end of May 17, 2023. Karl von Rohr left the Management Board with effect from October 31, 2023.\n\nThe Management Board comprised 9 members at the end of 2023 with a proportion of women of 11%. Deutsche Bank thereby fulfils the statutory requirements but remains behind its ambitions. As outlined at the AGM 2023, the Supervisory Board is not satisfied  with  the  representation  of  women  at  the  Management  Board  and  stands  by  the  commitment  to  increase  the percentage of female representation at the Management Board, and to foster and reward a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion  more  broadly.  As  part  of  the  Bank's  new  compensation  system,  the  Supervisory  Board  seeks  to  integrate  this ambition more firmly into the performance goals of the Management Board members. Generally, the reduced Management Board has been positively acknowledged internally and externally as being efficient.\n\nIn its meeting on July 27, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to grant a Dividend Equivalent Award of EUR 0.30 per share to Management Board members with share-based deferred compensation awards that were in the holding period at the time of the General Meeting 2023. A Dividend Equivalent is a right to receive a cash payment on the respective release date based on the amount of dividends that would have been paid during the retention period on the number of vested Deutsche Bank shares that are released on the Release Date. The Dividend Equivalent Awards will be calculated based on the dividend paid per Deutsche Bank share multiplied by the number of Deutsche Bank share units subject to the holding requirement (a fixed EUR value). Dividend Equivalents are subject to the same provisions as the underlying Award, including but not limited to suspension, forfeiture or clawback.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the compensation levels of the members of the Management Board annually and regularly engages external compensation advisors to support the review, while assuring that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. In 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted a review of the compensation levels taking into account comparable companies (peer groups) with the support of an external compensation advisor. On the basis of the results of this review and taking into account other aspects such as the duration of membership in the Management Board  or  changes  in  the  area  of  responsibility  within  the  Management  Board,  the  Supervisory  Board  took  the  following compensation decisions in 2023:\n\nA benchmarking study commissioned by the Supervisory Board showed that the level of compensation for the member of the Management Board responsible for the Corporate and Investment Bank is lower for this role compared to the peer group of international banks. Compared to international banks, the overall target compensation is between the 25. percentile and the median. For this reason and taking into account the duration of Fabrizio Campelli's membership of the Management Board, the  Supervisory  Board  decided  to  increase  his  total  target  compensation  to  a  more  market-oriented  overall  target compensation of \u20ac 8.8 million p.a. This represents an increase of 25.71% (an increase in base salary of 21.43%) with effect from April 1, 2023.\n\nThe target compensation of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) was also increased with effect from April 1, 2023. In this context, the Supervisory Board has assessed the CFO's senior position in the Bank and his role as President of Deutsche Bank AG in comparison  to  the  other  roles  on  the  Management  Board  and  took  into  account  the  duration  of  his  membership  of  the Management Board, considering another three years in the light of  the  extension  of  his  appointment  as  member  of  the Management  Board  with  effect  from  July  1,  2023.  James  von  Moltke's  overall  target  compensation  was  increased  to \u20ac 8.3 million p.a. This represents an increase of 12.16% (an increase in base salary of 6.67%).\n\nIn order to ensure uniform compensation structures for all Management Board members, the Supervisory Board also reviewed the ratio of fixed to variable compensation. According to regulatory requirements, variable compensation must not exceed 200% of the fixed compensation. With two exceptions, the target compensation of all members of the Management Board is consistently measured in such a way that, if the fulfillment of all objectives is fully achieved, this regulatory ceiling can be reached. To be consistent, the variable target compensation of Christian Sewing and Karl von Rohr were increased by 3.33% and 6.76% respectively with effect from April 1, 2023. Base salaries remained unchanged.\n\nThe total target compensation for Claudio de Sanctis in his capacity as a member of the Management Board and head of the Private  Bank  was  set  at  \u20ac 7.9 million  p.a.  with  effect  from  July  1,  2023,  i.e.,  from  his  appointment  as  a  member  of  the Management Board.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board took into account as a positive aspect the financial milestones achieved and the contributions of the individual members of the Management Board to this success in their performance evaluations. When determining the variable compensation for the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board acknowledged the continued efforts of the members of the Management Board in driving regulatory remediation activities. Although there are positive signals from the regulators since substantial control remediation progress was achieved, particularly in the USA and the UK, the Supervisory Board took into consideration that these remediation measures need continued focus across the Bank.\n\nThe Supervisory Board analyzed and assessed in detail the problems and negative consequences for customers in connection with  Project  Unity  (IT  migration  of  Postbank  customer  accounts  to  the  Deutsche  Bank  platform).  Although  the  technical migration of data records was implemented accurately on the system side, the impact on customer services and processes was clearly underestimated. In the opinion of both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, the large number of customers who experienced limitations as a result of the migration is unacceptable. In executing this integration program, the Bank failed to meet its own high standards and the expectations of its customers. Even though fast and massive adjustments were subsequently carried out and investments were made in additional resource capacity, IT and automated processes in order to eliminate the backlogs as quickly as possible, the Supervisory Board took into account the overall view of the issue when assessing performance with regard to granting variable compensation. In doing so, the individual degrees to which the individual  Management  Board  members  were  accountable  for  the  issues  were  taken  into  account  and,  based  on  the recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee, it was decided to reduce the individual achievement level for the short-term component of selected Management Board members involved.\n\nDetails  on  how  the  Short-Term  Award  is  calculated  are  presented  in  this  report  under  the  heading  'Application  of  the compensation system in the financial year'.\n\n## Approval of the Compensation Report 2022 by the Annual General Meeting 2023\n\nThe  Compensation  Report  2022  for  members  of  the  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board  of  Deutsche  Bank  as published on March 17, 2023, was submitted to the ordinary General Meeting on May 17, 2023, for approval in accordance with Section 120a (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act.

It also determines, in accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, what relative proportions the fixed compensation on the one hand and short-term and long-term variable compensation on the other hand have in the target total compensation. In this context, the Supervisory Board ensures in particular that the variable compensation linked to achieving long-term objectives exceeds the portion of variable compensation linked to short-term objectives.\n\nWhen setting the target total compensation for each member of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board takes into account the scope and complexity of the respective Management Board member's functional responsibility as well as the experience and length of service of the member on the Management Board. Furthermore, the compensation amounts are reviewed for their appropriateness on the basis of market data for suitable peer groups. On the basis of these criteria, the Supervisory Board set the relative percentages for the compensation components within the target total compensation as follows:\n\n## Relative shares of the total annual target compensation allocated to the different compensation components (%)\n\n| Compensation components                   | Relative share of total  compensation in %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Base Salary                               | ~ 33-37%                                     |\n| Regular fringe benefits                   | ~ 1%                                         |\n| Pension service costs / pension allowance | ~ 7-9%                                       |\n| Short-Term Award                          | ~ 22-23%                                     |\n| Long-Term Award                           | ~ 33-34%                                     |\n| Reference total compensation              | 100%                                         |",

        "page_content": "The compensation of the Management Board members is limited (capped) in several ways (maximum compensation).\n\nPursuant  to  Section  25a  (5)  of  the  German  Banking  Act  (Kreditwesengesetz  -  KWG),  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  variable compensation is generally limited to 1:1 (cap regulation), i.e. the amount of variable compensation must not exceed that of fixed compensation, unless the shareholders of a bank resolve to increase the ratio of fixed to variable compensation to up to 1:2. The General Meeting in May 2014 made use of this possibility and increased the ratio to 1:2.\n\nThe Supervisory Board additionally limited the maximum possible achievement levels for the short-term objectives (STA) and long-term objectives (LTA) consistently to 150% of the target variable compensation. Furthermore, it specified an additional amount limit (cap) for the aggregate amount of base salary, STA and LTA of \u20ac 9.85 million. This means that even with target achievement levels that would lead to higher compensation amounts, compensation is capped at a maximum of \u20ac 9.85 million. After the target achievement level is assessed, if the calculation should result in variable compensation or total compensation that exceeds one of the specified caps, the variable compensation is to be reduced. This is to take place through a pro rata reduction of the STA and LTA.\n\n## Target and maximum amounts of base salary and variable compensation\n\n| in \u20ac                                                                                  | Base  salary   | Short-Term  Award   | Long-Term  Award   | Total  compensation 1   | Total  compensation 1   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| CEO 2                                                                                 |                |                     |                    |                         |                         |\n| Target value                                                                          | 3,600,000      | 2,280,000           | 3,420,000          | 9,300,000               | 9,000,000               |\n| Maximum value                                                                         | 3,600,000      | 3,420,000           | 5,130,000          | 9,850,000               | 9,850,000               |\n| President 2, 3                                                                        |                |                     |                    |                         |                         |\n| Target value                                                                          | 3,200,000      | 2,040,000           | 3,060,000          | 8,300,000               | 7,400,000               |\n| Maximum value                                                                         | 3,200,000      | 3,060,000           | 4,590,000          | 9,850,000               | 9,600,000               |\n| Ordinary Board Member responsible for Corporate Bank and  Investment Bank (CB & IB) 2 |                |                     |                    |                         |                         |\n| Target value                                                                          | 3,400,000      | 2,160,000           | 3,240,000          | 8,800,000               | 7,000,000               |\n| Maximum value                                                                         | 3,400,000      | 3,240,000           | 4,860,000          | 9,850,000               | 9,100,000               |\n| Ordinary Board Member responsible for PB 2                                            |                |                     |                    |                         |                         |\n| Target value                                                                          | 3,000,000      | 1,960,000           | 2,940,000          | 7,900,000               | 7,400,000               |\n| Maximum value                                                                         | 3,000,000      | 2,940,000           | 4,410,000          | 9,850,000               | 9,600,000               |\n| All other Ordinary Board Members                                                      |                |                     |                    |                         |                         |\n| Target value                                                                          | 2,400,000      | 1,640,000           | 2,460,000          | 6,500,000               | 6,500,000               |\n| Maximum value                                                                         | 2,400,000      | 2,460,000           | 3,690,000          | 8,550,000               | 8,550,000               |\n\n- 1 Limit the maximum total amount of basic salary and variable compensation to the upper limit set by the Supervisory Board\n- 2 For further details on compensation decision, please refer to the section \"Management Board Changes and Compensation Decisions in 2023\" in this report\n- 3 President and Ordinary Board members responsible for Asset Management (AM) and Finance (CFO)\n\nIn addition, in accordance with Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board also set an upper limit for the maximum total compensation of \u20ac 12 million for each Management Board member (Maximum Compensation).  The  Maximum  Compensation  is  set  consistently  for  all  Management  Board  members.  The  Maximum Compensation corresponds to the sum of all compensation components for any financial year. This comprises not only the base salary, STA and LTA, but also the fringe benefits and service costs for the company pension plan or pension allowances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Application of the compensation system in the financial year\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation components in the form of base salary, fringe benefits and contributions to the pension plan or pension allowances were granted in the financial year as fixed compensation and in accordance with the individual agreements in the service contracts. Due to the requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision of the Annual General Meeting in May 2014, the ratio of fixed to variable compensation is generally limited to 1:2 (cap rule). Therefore, when determining the amount of base salary as part of the target compensation, it must be taken into account that the variable compensation may not exceed the maximum value of 200% of the fixed compensation.\n\nThe expenses for fringe benefits and pension service costs vary in their annual amounts. Although the contribution to Deutsche Bank's pension plan is defined consistently for all Management Board members, the amounts to be contributed by Deutsche Bank during the year in the form of pension service cost accruals vary based on the length of service on the Management Board within the financial year, the age of the Management Board member and actuarial figures (additional information is provided in the section 'Benefits upon regular contract termination').\n\n## Variable compensation\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board,  based  on  the  proposal  of  the  Compensation  Control  Committee,  determined  the  variable compensation  for  the  Management  Board  members  for  the  2023  financial  year.  Variable  compensation  comprises  two components, a short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) with a weighting of 40% and a long-term component (LongTerm Award (LTA)) with a weighting of 60% in relation to the target variable compensation.\n\nAll objectives, measurements and assessment criteria that were used for the assessment of performance for the 2023 financial year are derived from Deutsche Bank's strategy and are in line with the compensation system approved by the General Meeting.  The  objectives  were  selected  to  set  suitable  incentives  for  the  Management  Board  members,  to  promote  the development of Deutsche Bank's earnings and the alignment to the interests of shareholders as well as to fulfill Deutsche Bank's social responsibility through the inclusion of sustainability aspects and climate protection. The challenging objectives reflect the Bank's ambitions. If the objectives are not achieved, the variable compensation can be zero; in the case of overachievement, the maximum achievement level is limited to 150% of the target value.\n\n## Balance of financial and non-financial objectives\n\nFinancial and non-financial objectives are considered in a balanced way when setting the objectives. In relation to the total variable compensation, there was a greater focus on financial objectives in the 2023 financial year, with a weighting of around 68%. Both the financial and non-financial objectives were chosen in such a way that they are quantitatively or qualitatively measurable at the end of the financial year. Around 75% of the targets are quantitatively measurable and a portion of around 25% is measured qualitatively.\n\n## Short-Term Award (STA)\n\nThe amount of the Short-Term Award for the 2023 financial year is based on the achievement level during the assessment period of the short-term individual and divisional objectives. The assessment period coincides with the financial year and is one year.\n\nThe Short-Term Award comprises the following two elements with different weightings:\n\n- -Individual Objectives and Behavior Objective (62.5%)\n- -Individual Balanced Scorecards and Key Deliverables (37.5%)\n\nFor each of these components, the Supervisory Board determines the achievement level based on a clearly structured yearend assessment process at the beginning of the following year. The achievement of the two components determines the overall  achievement  level  for  each  Management  Board  member  which  in  turn  determines  the  amount  of  the  short-term component for the preceding financial year.",

On the basis of 100%. Pro rata temporis upon joining or leaving during the year\n\n## Individual objectives\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets personal and divisional objectives (Individual Objectives) for each member of the Management Board at the beginning of the year. The weightings of each of these objectives as well as relevant quantitatively or qualitatively measurable  performance  criteria  for  their  assessment  are  defined  as  well.  The  objectives  are  chosen  so  that  they  are challenging, ambitious and sufficiently concrete in order to ensure there is an appropriate alignment of performance and compensation and that the 'pay-for-performance' principle is taken into account.\n\nThe  Individual  Objectives  are  derived  from  the  corporate  strategy  and  foster  its  implementation.  They  are  set  for  each Management Board member in consideration of his or her respective area of functional responsibility and the contribution of this  area  of  functional  responsibility  to  advancing  Deutsche  Bank's  overall  strategy.  ESG  objectives  such  as  the  further development of the sustainability strategy or the promotion of measures to improve regulatory remediation are also included as  individual  objectives.  Individual  Objectives  can  also  be  defined  as  project  or  regional  targets.  Besides  operational measures, the implementation of strategic projects and initiatives can be agreed as objectives as well, if they are directly instrumental in the implementation of the strategy, by contributing to, for example, the structure, organization and sustainable development of Deutsche Bank.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2023 financial year, a maximum of 4 Individual Objectives were set with different weightings for each Management Board member. For these objectives, the Supervisory Board has assigned clear expectations and financial and/or non-financial performance criteria at the beginning of the year, such as financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), achievements of milestones, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or Supervisory Board feedback, stakeholder Feedback and qualitative  assessments.  These  enable  the  Supervisory  Board  to  objectively  assess  the  performance  contribution  of  the respective Management Board member towards the concrete execution of the objectives.\n\nIn addition to the individual objectives the Supervisory Board evaluates the behavior of each Management Board member by reflecting on individual performance against the Bank's key values and beliefs as well as corresponding leadership behavior rules. Focus Topics in 2023 were Integrity, Innovation and Sustainable Performance. With regard to the linkage between behavior and Management Board compensation the Supervisory Board expects the Management Board members to act as role models. Only outstanding performance that goes beyond the expectations of the respective role is incentivized.\n\nAt year-end, the determination of the achievement levels follows a pre-defined process. In a first step, all members of the Management  Board  perform  an  initial  self-assessment  of  the  achievement  levels  of  their  objectives.  The  self-assessed achievement levels are then discussed in conversations with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chairman of the Supervisory  Board  and  the  Compensation  Control  Committee.  Based  on  the  feedback  from  these  conversations,  the Compensation  Control  Committee  prepares  a  proposal  for  the  Supervisory  Board  for  its  decision.  For  this  purpose  the achievement levels are combined into an average for each Management Board member according to pre-defined weightings.\n\nThe following overview shows the objectives as well as the achievement levels as resolved on by the Supervisory Board for each Management Board member.",

The degrees of achievement thus determined for the individual objectives are consolidated into an average for each Management Board member according to the weightings defined in advance. The degree of target achievement determined accordingly is multiplied by the target amount of 62.5% of the variable target compensation for the STA. This results in the calculated payout amount for the component of the individual objectives.",

With the Balanced Scorecards, the Bank has an appropriate tool for the steering and control of key performance indicators that can be used to check the achievement level of financial and non-financial objectives against pre-defined measurement parameters at any time and to measure them transparently for the performance year at the beginning of the following year. At the same time, the Balanced Scorecards provide an overview of the priorities of the individual divisions across the entire Group.\n\nBased  on  the  functional  responsibilities  according  to  the  Business  Allocation  Plan  for  the  Management  Board,  each Management  Board  member  is  assigned  at  least  one  individual  Balanced  Scorecard  and  a  maximum  of  4  Balanced Scorecards. If more than one Balanced Scorecard is assigned to a Management Board member, these are weighted based on the size and complexity of the associated activities effected on each Scorecard. Four Management Board members have more than one Balanced Scorecard due to their multiple functional and/or divisional responsibilities. The table below shows the number of Balanced Scorecards and their respective weightings.",

For  example,  in  order  to  foster  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  aspects  in  the compensation system, ESG topics have been given an even greater consideration since 2021 in the Balanced Scorecards and also in the Long-Term Award (LTA).\n\nThe KPIs within the individual categories are set at the beginning of the year for each Management Board member individually along with corresponding targets, thresholds and assessment parameters. In addition, a weighting is set for each category. The weightings that the individual categories have within the overall Balanced Scorecard can be up to 65% depending on the functional responsibility of the Management Board member. The KPIs of the Balanced Scorecards are measured continuously throughout the year, but the overall assessment is made at the end of the year.\n\nThe calculation logic for determining the final levels of achievement for each Management Board member is as follows:\n\nIn a first step, the achievement band of each KPI is determined. If a minimum threshold value is not reached, the achievement level for this KPI is set at zero. Once a maximum limit for a KPI has been reached, the achievement level is set at 150%. For a  clear  overview,  the  Balanced  Scorecard  shows  if  each  individual  KPI  was  fulfilled  or  exceeded  based  on  the  defined assessment criteria ('green'), or only achieved to less than 100% ('amber') or not achieved ('red').\n\nIn a second step, the achievement level for each category is calculated taking into account the assessment of the KPIs from the first step and the resulting bands applicable to the respective category. When all objectives of a category are exceeded, the achievement level for a category can be up to 150%. However, if none of the minimum threshold values of a category is met, the achievement level is 0%.",

To emphasize this, the Supervisory Board decided that the Long-Term Award (LTA) will account for 60% of the total target variable compensation. At the beginning of each financial year, the Supervisory Board specifies the collective long-term objectives for the Management Board members for the LTA. The objectives and their weightings in the LTA for 2023 are:\n\n- -ESG Objectives (33.33%)\n- -Relative Total Shareholder Return of the Deutsche Bank share (25%)\n- -Group Financials (41.67%)\n\nAll LTA objectives are assessed over a period of three years. 60% of the target compensation for each objective is multiplied by the target level achieved in the performance year and thus makes up the largest share for that respective financial year. 30% of the applicable objective target compensation is based on the achievement level for the preceding financial year and 10% is determined based on the achievement level for the financial year before that. This results in a weighted overall achievement level for the performance year.",

To link Management Board compensation closely and  consistently  to  the  Bank's  sustainability  strategy,  the  Supervisory  Board  resolved  to  combine  the  Bank's  strategic sustainability targets in an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) component and to implement the results as one of the collective objectives within the LTA (ESG component).\n\nThe ESG component accounts for a share of 33.33% of the LTA. This corresponds to 20% of the total variable compensation and  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  ESG  agenda  for  Deutsche  Bank.  At  the  beginning  of  each  financial  year,  the Supervisory Board sets targets as well as upper limits and lower limits for all the objectives bundled in the ESG component. The assessment of the achievement levels for the financial year takes place retrospectively.

This results in a weighted overall achievement level of 71.04% for the three-year period for the portion of the LTA attributable to the ESG component.\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)\n\nA key strategic target of the Bank is the performance of the Deutsche Bank share in comparison to the performance of the shares of its competitors (Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)). The target for the RTSR for the Deutsche Bank share in comparison to selected financial institutions is intended to strengthen the sustainable performance of the Deutsche Bank share. The RTSR links the interests of the Management Board with those of shareholders. In addition, the RTSR provides a relative measurement of performance, creating an incentive to outperform the relevant peers. The Total Shareholder Return is defined as the share price performance plus theoretically reinvested gross dividends. The RTSR is derived and calculated based on the Total Shareholder Return of the Deutsche Bank share in relation to the average Total Shareholder Returns of the peer group.\n\nIf the RTSR is greater than 100%, then the target achievement level increases proportionally to an upper limit of 150% of the target figure, i.e., the target achievement level increases by 1% for each percentage point above 100%. If the RTSR average is less than 100%, the target achievement level declines disproportionately. For each percentage point decline of the RTSR in the range of less than 100% and 80%, the target achievement level declines by two percentage points. For each percentage point decline of the RTSR in the range between less than 80% and 60%, the target achievement level declines by three percentage points. If the RTSR does not exceed 60% over the entire assessment period, the target achievement level is zero.",

        "page_content": "## Appropriateness of Management Board compensation and compliance with the set maximum compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the appropriateness of the individual compensation components as well as the amount of total compensation. The review of the appropriateness of Management Board compensation concluded that the Management Board compensation resulting from the achievement levels for the 2023 financial year is appropriate.\n\n## Horizontal appropriateness\n\nThrough the horizontal comparison, the Supervisory Board ensures that the target total compensation is appropriate in relation to the tasks and achievements of the Management Board as well as the company's situation and is also customary in the market. In this context, the level and structure of compensation, in particular, are examined at comparable companies (peer groups). Suitable companies in consideration of Deutsche Bank's market position (in particular with regard to business sector, size and country) are used as the basis for this comparison. The assessment of horizontal appropriateness takes place in comparison with the following three peer groups.\n\n## Peer Group 1:\n\nThis group consists of 10 global banks with\n\n- -a comparable business model; and\n- -a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization).\n\nThe 10 institutions in this Peer Group are identical to the banks used to measure the Relative Total Shareholder Return (see Chapter \"Relative Total Shareholder Return\"). These are the following: Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS and UniCredit.\n\n## Peer Group 2:\n\nThis group consists of 15 European banks with\n\n- -a comparable business model; and\n- -a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization).\n\nThese are the following banks: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Banco Santander, Barclays, BNP Paribas, BPCE, Rabobank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, HSBC Holdings, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS Group and UniCredit.\n\n## Peer Group 3:\n\nThis group includes the companies of the German Stock Index (DAX).\n\nThe horizontal appropriateness of the Management Board compensation is reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board regularly engages external compensation advisors for the review of horizontal appropriateness, while assuring itself that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. The Supervisory Board takes the results of  the review into consideration when setting the target total compensation for the Management Board members.\n\n## Vertical appropriateness\n\nIn  addition  to  the  horizontal  comparison,  the  Supervisory  Board  considers  a  vertical  comparison,  which  compares  the compensation  of  the  Management  Board  and  the  compensation  of  the  workforce.  Within  the  vertical  comparison,  the Supervisory Board considers in particular, in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, the development of the compensation over time. This involves a comparison of the Management Board compensation and the compensation of two groups of employees. Taken into account are, on the one hand, the compensation of the senior management, which comprises the first management level below the Management Board and members of the top executive committees of the divisions,  as  well  as  of  management  board  members  of  significant  institutions  within  Deutsche  Bank  Group  and  of corresponding management board-1 level positions with management responsibility. The Management Board compensation is compared to, on the other hand, the compensation of all other employees of Deutsche Bank Group worldwide (tariff and non-tariff employees).",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with the set maximum compensation (cap)\n\nThe maximum compensation limit (cap) is set at \u20ac 12 million for each Management Board member. This is based on the actual expense and/or actual disbursement of the compensation awarded for a financial year. The base salaries are fixed amounts. The expenses for fringe benefits vary from Management Board member to Management Board member in any given year. The contribution to Deutsche Bank's pension plan or pension allowance is set at the same amount for all Management Board members. However, the amount to be recognized by the Bank during the year for Deutsche Bank's pension service costs fluctuates based on actuarial variables. As the expense amount for the multi-year variable compensation components of the Short-Term Award (STA) and Long-Term Award (LTA) are not determined until up to seven years due to the deferral periods, compliance with the maximum compensation set for the 2023 financial year can only be conclusively reported within the framework of the Compensation Reports for the financial years up to 2031. Compliance with the maximum compensation limit as defined under Section 87a of the German Stock Corporation Act is, however, already ensured for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Deferrals and holding periods\n\nThe Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV) generally stipulates a three-year assessment period for the determination of the variable compensation for Management Board members. Deutsche Bank complies with this requirement by assessing each of the objectives of the Long-Term Award (LTA) over a three-year period. If the relevant three years cannot be attributed to a member of the Management Board because the member joined the Bank only recently, the achievement level for the objectives will be determined for the period that can be attributed to the member. The deferral period for the LTA is in principle five years. If the assessment period is shorter than the prescribed minimum, the deferral period of the variable compensation to be granted is extended by the number of years missing for the minimum assessment period. The Short-Term Award (STA) has an assessment period of one year. The deferral period for the STA is in principle seven years.\n\nThe Long-Term Award (LTA) is granted in the form of share-based instruments (Restricted Equity Awards (REAs)). The REAs vest over a deferral period of 5 years in 4 tranches, beginning with a tranche of 40% in year 2 and three tranches of 20% each in year 3, 4, and 5 following the grant of the variable compensation (grant date). Subsequent to the grant date, the REAs of each tranche are subject to an additional holding period of one year. Accordingly, the Management Board members cannot dispose of the shares underlying the REAs until after 4 years, at the earliest, and in full until after 6 years following the grant date. During the deferral and holding periods, the value of the REAs is linked to the performance of the Deutsche Bank share and is therefore tied to the long-term performance of the Bank, and thereby strengthens the alignment of the Management Board members' incentives to Deutsche Bank's performance.\n\nThe Short-Term Award (STA) is generally granted in the form of deferred cash compensation (Restricted Incentive Awards RIAs). The STA is paid out in four tranches of 25% each over a total period of seven years in year 1, 3, 5 and 7 following the grant date. However, if the STA accounts for more than 50% of the total variable compensation, the portion exceeding 50% is also granted in the form of Restricted Equity Awards (REAs). This ensures that at least 50% of the total variable compensation is always granted in a share-based form in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The portion exceeding 50% is subject to the same deferral rules as the share-based compensation from the LTA.\n\nInstead of receiving Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) as described above, holders of specific  functions  at  certain  Deutsche  Bank U.S. entities  are  required  by  applicable  regulation  to  be  compensated under different plans. Restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and restricted cash awards. The recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the Award Date and the awards are held on the recipient's behalf. These awards are restricted for a period of time (subject to the applicable plan rules and award statements, including performance  conditions  and  forfeiture  provisions).  The  restriction  period  is  aligned  to  the  retention  periods  applicable  to Deutsche Bank's usual deferred awards. With regard to the Management Board members, these rules apply to Stefan Simon due to his role as CEO of Deutsche Bank USA Corp.\n\nIf  a  member  of  the  Management  Board  is  identified  as  'Senior  Management  Function  (SMF)'  holder  by  the  Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK, specific deferral provisions under UK regulation, in principle, apply. Fabrizio Campelli was identified as SMF holder for 2023 variable compensation purposes due to his oversight responsibility for the UK region. In 2023, it was agreed with the PRA that the proportion of the variable compensation which corresponds to the time spent for this regional oversight responsibility is subject to the deferral provisions under UK regulation. Therefore, 10% of his variable compensation is deferred in line with the UK regulation, i.e. 4% is granted in Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) and paid out in two equal tranches in year 1 and 3 following the grant date and 6% is granted in Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and vests in 5 equal tranches in year 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 following the grant date. After the vesting, each tranche is subject to an additional holding period of one year.",

In addition, the individual tranches are subject to specific forfeiture conditions until they vest.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews whether the results achieved by the Management Board members in the past are sustainable (backtesting). If the outcome is that the achievements underlying the granting of the variable compensation were not sustainable, the awards may be partially or fully forfeited.\n\nAlso, if the Group's results are negative, previously granted variable compensation may be declared fully or partially forfeited during the deferral period. In addition, the awards may be fully or partially forfeited if specific solvency or liquidity conditions are not met. Furthermore, awards may be forfeited in whole or in part in the event of individual misconduct (including breaches of regulations), dismissal for cause or negative individual contributions to performance (malus).\n\nIn addition, the contracts of the Management Board members also enable the Supervisory Board to reclaim already paid or delivered compensation components due to certain individual negative performance contributions by the Management Board member (clawback) in accordance with the provisions pursuant to Sections 18 (5) and 20 (6) of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV). The clawback is possible for the entire variable compensation for a financial year until the end of two years after the end of the deferral period of the last tranche of the compensation elements awarded on a deferred basis for the respective financial year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews in due time before the respective due dates the possibility of a full or partial forfeiture (malus) or reclaiming (clawback) of the Management Board members' variable compensation components. There was no forfeiture or clawback of awards in 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board saw Christiana Riley's departure from the bank early to take up a job at a financial institution that is in competition with Deutsche Bank as grounds for the forfeiture of deferred and non-vested variable compensation components (awards) in accordance with the applicable plan rules and award statements. Christiana Riley agreed to this.",

        "page_content": "## Information on shares and fulfilling the share ownership obligation (Shareholding Guidelines)\n\nAll members of the Management Board are required to acquire a significant amount of Deutsche Bank shares and to hold them on a long-term basis. This requirement is meant to foster the alignment of the Management Board members with Deutsche Bank and its shareholders and to ensure a long-term link to the development of Deutsche Bank's business.\n\nFor the Chief Executive Officer, the number of shares to be held is equivalent to 200% of his annual gross base salary, and for the other Management Board members, 100% of their annual gross base salary. The requirements of the shareholding obligation must first be fulfilled as of the date on which the share-based variable compensation that has been granted to the Management Board member since his or her appointment to the Management Board (waiting period) in total corresponds to 1.33 times the shareholding obligation. Compliance with the requirements is reviewed semi-annually. If the required number of shares is not met, the Management Board members must correct any deficiencies by the next review.\n\nIn the context of granting variable compensation, the Supervisory Board can resolve on an individual basis that not only the Long-Term Award (LTA) but also parts of the Short-Term Award (STA) or the STA as a whole may be awarded in shares until the shareholding obligation is fulfilled. This is intended to ensure faster compliance with the shareholding obligation.\n\n## Members of the Management Board\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  number  of  outstanding  share  awards  of  the  current  Management  Board  members  as  of February 10, 2023, and February 9, 2024 as well as the number of share awards newly granted, delivered or forfeited in this period.\n\n| Members of the Management Board   | Balance as of  Feb 10, 2023   | Granted   | Delivered   | Forfeited   | Balance as of  Feb 9, 2024   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Christian Sewing                  | 895,373                       | 226,006   | -

        "page_content": "The  Chairman  of  the  Management  Board,  Mr. Sewing,  voluntarily  committed  to  invest  15%  of  his  monthly  net  salary  in Deutsche Bank shares from September 2019 until the end of December 2023. In each case, purchases take place on the 22nd day of each month or on the following trading day.\n\n## Benefits as of the end of the mandate\n\n## Benefits upon regular contract termination\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  allocates  an  entitlement  to  pension  plan  benefits  to  the  Management  Board  members.  These entitlements involve a pension plan with predefined contributions. Under this pension plan, a personal pension account is set up for each participating member of the Management Board with effect from the start of office as a Management Board member.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Management  Board,  including  the  Management  Board  Chairman,  receive  a  uniform,  contractually defined, fixed annual contribution amount of \u20ac 650,000. The contribution accrues interest that is credited in advance and determined by means of an age-related factor, up to the age of 60. For entitlements from a first-time or renewed appointment starting from the 2021 financial year, interest accrues at an average rate of 2% per annum, for legacy entitlements 4%. From the age of 61 onwards, an additional contribution equal to the amount resulting from applying the above interest rate to the balance of the pension account as of December 31 of the previous year will be credited to the pension account. The annual contributions, taken together, form the pension capital amount available to pay the future pension benefits upon the occurrence of a pension event (retirement age, disability or death). The pension account balance is vested from the start.\n\nIf a Management Board member is subject to non-German income tax, the granting of an annual pension cash allowance of \u20ac 650,000 may be selected as an alternative to the pension plan entitlement. This is subject to the precondition that receiving the  customary  pension  plan  contributions  entails  not  insignificant  tax-related  disadvantages  for  the  Management  Board member compared to receiving a pension allowance. This option can be exercised once and from then on applies to the entire term of office of the Management Board member.\n\nThe following table shows the annual contributions, the interest credits, the account balances and the annual service costs for the years 2023 and 2022 as well as the corresponding defined benefit obligations for each member of the Management Board in office in 2023 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31,2023. The different balances are attributable to the different lengths of service on the Management Board, the respective age-related factors, and the different contribution rates.\n\n| Members of the

Management Board members are in principle entitled to receive a severance payment upon an early termination of their appointment, provided the Bank is not entitled to revoke the appointment or give notice under the contractual agreement for cause. In accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, the severance payment amounts to up to a maximum of two times the annual compensation at the maximum and must not exceed the amount that would be payable as compensation for the remaining term of the service contract. The calculation of the severance payment is based on the annual compensation for the previous financial year and, if applicable, on the expected annual compensation for the current financial year. The severance payment is determined and granted in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements, in particular with the provisions of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitusVerV).\n\nIn the event of a change of control, Management Board members have a special right to termination of their service contract. However, in such case, there is no entitlement to a severance payment.",

        "page_content": "## Other service contract provisions\n\n## Term of the service contract\n\nThe term of the Management Board service contracts is linked to the duration of the appointment and is a maximum of five years in accordance with Section 84 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board shall decide at an early stage, no later than six months before the expiry of the appointment period, on a renewed appointment. In the case of the Management Board member's reappointment, the service contract is extended for the duration of a renewed appointment.\n\nFor first-time appointments, a contract term of three years is not to be exceeded. The Management Board service contract ends automatically with the expiry of the appointment period without requiring the express notice of termination.\n\n## Reduction of base salary in connection with compensation from other mandates\n\nThe service contracts of the Management Board members contain an obligation of the members to ensure that they will not receive any compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled in their capacity as a member of any corporate body, in particular a supervisory board, advisory board or similar body of any group entity of the Bank pursuant to Section 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Accordingly, Management Board members do not receive any compensation for mandates on boards of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries.\n\nA Management Board member's base salary will be reduced in an amount equal to 50% of the compensation from a mandate - in particular supervisory board or advisory board mandates - at a company that does not belong to Deutsche Bank Group. There is no such deduction of any compensation that does not exceed \u20ac 100,000 per mandate and calendar year.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the base salary of one member of the Management Board was reduced by the amount of the compensation from one mandate at a company that does not belong to Deutsche Bank Group, since the compensation exceeded the threshold amount.\n\n## Post-contractual non-compete clause\n\nAfter leaving the Management Board, the members are as a general rule subject to a one-year non-compete clause. During the  non-compete  period,  Deutsche  Bank  pays  the  Management  Board  member  compensation  (waiting  allowance 'Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') amounting to 65% of his or her annual base salary. The waiting allowance will be credited against any claim to severance pay. In addition, the waiting allowance will be reduced by any income that the Management Board member earns during the non-compete period from self-employed, salaried or other paid activities that are not subject to the non-compete clause. Deutsche Bank may waive a Management Board member's compliance with the post-contractual noncompete clause. From the date of the waiver, if and when such waiver is granted, Deutsche Bank's obligation to pay the waiting allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') ends.\n\nChristiana Riley left the Management Board with effect from the end of May 17, 2023. Her service contract was terminated by way of mutual agreement with effect from the end of May 31, 2023. As provided for in her service contract, a waiting allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung')  was  agreed  in  accordance  with  the  post-contractual  non-competition  clause  in  the  amount  of \u20ac 130,000 per month, corresponding to 65% of her fixed base salary. The post-contractual non-compete provision applies from June 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023, in the scope set forth in the service contract.\n\nKarl von Rohr left the Management Board with effect from the end of October 31, 2023. The Service Contract ended with the end of his appointment period. As provided for in his service contract, a waiting allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') was agreed in accordance with the post-contractual non-compete clause in the amount of \u20ac 162,500 per month, corresponding to 65% of his fixed base salary. The post-contractual non-compete provision applies from November 1, 2023, to October 31, 2024, in the scope set forth in the service contract.\n\n## Deviations from the compensation system\n\nThere were no deviations from the compensation system in the 2023 financial year.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook for the 2024 financial year\n\nThe current Management Board compensation system was approved by the General Meeting in 2021. Since then, it has been proven that the system works well and sets the right incentives. At the same time, the compensation system is competitive. Nevertheless, the Supervisory Board and, in preparation, the Compensation Control Committee of Deutsche Bank regularly review the compensation system of the Management Board members with regard to market trends and investor feedback. Furthermore, the regulatory requirements of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitutsVergV) as well as the principles and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), as most recently amended, are taken into account.\n\nAs part of the review process in 2023, points of improvement were identified, which are explained below. These improvements are reflected in a new compensation system that will be submitted for approval to the General Meeting in May 2024 with effect from the beginning of 2024 onwards.\n\n## Forward-looking assessment period for the Long-Term Incentive (LTI)\n\nIn the previous compensation system, the collective objectives of the Long-Term Incentive were assessed over a period of three years. Thereby, the current financial year was weighted at 60%. The two previous years were weighted at 30% and 10%, respectively. To reflect the feedback of shareholders, a forward-looking assessment period will be used instead for the performance measurement of the future LTI. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous compensation system which stipulated different weightings for each financial year, the target achievement will be determined after three financial years. As a result, the Supervisory Board will set objectives and their target values for three years in the future. This fosters a long-term focus and thus the sustainable development of the Company.\n\n## Reduction of complexity\n\nThe Supervisory Board has identified two changes to significantly reduce the overall complexity of the compensation system and thus increase transparency in the Compensation Report:\n\n- -The complexity of variable compensation has been simplified by reducing the number of objectives. In the Short-Term Incentive (STI), a maximum of five objectives for measuring individual and divisional performance will be set in future instead of the previous three to four individual objectives, plus an additional behavior objective and a complex balanced scorecard with a large number of Key Performance Indicators. The future STI objectives can be categorized into \"Financial\", \"ESG\" and \"Personal\", always ensuring a balance of financial and non-financial, quantitative, and qualitative objectives. The LTI provides for a lower number of objectives compared to the previous system. The objectives of the LTI are reflected by  Group  financials  (Return  on  Tangible  Equity  (RoTE)  and  Total  Book  Value  per  Share  (TBVPS)),  Relative  Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) and ESG objectives.\n- -Total variable compensation will continue to be granted predominantly in deferred form to ensure the sustainability of earnings within the framework of the business and risk strategies. Furthermore, total variable compensation will continue to be granted predominantly as equity-based instruments to achieve an even stronger alignment of the Management Board members'  compensation  to  the  Bank's  performance  and  its  share  price.  In  the  previous  compensation  system,  the underlying scheme for deferral and holding periods was perceived as complex. In the future, half of the STI will be paid out directly after the one-year assessment period in cash and the other half is granted equity-based with an additional holding period  of  one  year.  The  LTI  will  be  paid  out  in  equity,  starting  one  year  after  the  three-year  assessment  period,  and distributed over five equal, consecutive installments, each with an additional holding period of one year. In total, the full LTI pay out amount of a tranche will be available for disposal after nine years. The Supervisory Board is confident that the new scheme for deferral and holding periods is significantly simpler and more comprehensible, while at the same time fulfilling the regulatory requirements of the InstitutsVergV.",

        "page_content": "## Increase of pay-for-performance alignment\n\nSeveral shareholders expressed concerns regarding the design of the previous target achievement curve for the Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) in the long-term component, which measures the TSR of the Deutsche Bank share in relation to the average TSR of a selected peer group. In particular, shareholders criticized that payout starts at a TSR of 40% below the peer group and an equal performance with the peer group results in a target achievement of 100%. In line with the market practices of international banks and to further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment of Deutsche Bank's compensation, the target achievement for the RTSR will be assessed based on Deutsche Bank's percentile rank compared to the individual companies in the peer group. According to the new method, the payout starts if the percentile rank of Deutsche Bank is at the median, i.e., Deutsche Bank must outperform 50% of the companies in the peer group. A target achievement of 100% is defined as reaching the 70th percentile, which, in the current peer group of ten international banks, corresponds to achieving rank 4 in terms of TSR performance. Only ranks 1 and 2 allow a payout at the upper threshold of 150% target achievement. The Supervisory Board would like to point out that the ambition level of the new target achievement curve goes beyond the current practice in the German market and shows that shareholders' feedback has been heard and implemented.\n\n## Increase in market alignment\n\nTo  increase  market  alignment  and  harmonize  further  contractual  agreements  of  the  Management  Board  compensation, changes have been made in the pension scheme, shareholding guidelines and termination benefits.\n\n- -With regard to the former pension scheme, a simple cash allowance model will be introduced for newly appointed members of the Management Board. The cash allowance is paid out directly in a lump sum. This avoids interest rate and biometric risks in financing a pension entitlement as well as the administrative procedures associated with this for the Deutsche Bank. In addition, the annual pension allowance for a newly ordinary Management Board member will be 30% lower than the pension contribution currently granted.\n- -Furthermore, in line with current market practice, a build-up phase of four years will be introduced for the obligation under shareholding guidelines.\n- -In  line  with  German market practice as well as recommendation G.13 German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), severance payments are currently limited to two times the annual total compensation and are not paid beyond the remaining term of the service contract (severance cap). Considering feedback from investors and other stakeholders, the Supervisory Board  will  reduce  the  severance  cap  at  a  maximum  of  two  years'  base  salary  for  newly  appointed  members  of  the Management Board. In addition, the waiting allowance (Karenzentsch\u00e4digung) for the duration of the subsequent noncompetition period will be lowered from 65% of the annual base salary to 50% of the annual base salary.\n\n## Outlook on the objectives of the variable compensation 2024-2026\n\nThe new compensation system establishes a strong alignment of interests between the Management Board members and shareholders of Deutsche Bank and allows for a high degree of transparency for stakeholders. Against this background, the Supervisory Board made a commitment to disclose the long-term objectives and target values of the variable compensation 2024, which is based on the new compensation system, before the start of the respective assessment period. Short term individual targets will continue to be disclosed retrospectively.",

New compensation provisions were last adopted by resolution of the General Meeting on May 17, 2023. Accordingly, the following provisions apply as of May 17, 2023:\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual compensation ('Supervisory Board Compensation'). The amount of  the  annual  base  compensation  for  each  Supervisory  Board  member  is  \u20ac 300,000,  for  the  Supervisory  Board Chairman \u20ac 950,000, and for each Deputy Chairperson \u20ac 475,000.\n\nChairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board are paid additional fixed annual compensation amounts as follows:\n\n| Committee chair  in \u20ac                     |         |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Audit Committee                           | 150,000 |\n| Risk Committee                            | 150,000 |\n| Technology, Data and Innovation Committee | 150,000 |\n| Chairman's Committee                      | 100,000 |\n| Nomination Committee                      | 100,000 |\n| Compensation Control Committee            | 100,000 |\n| Regulatory Oversight Committee            | 100,000 |\n| Strategy and Sustainability Committee     | 100,000 |\n| Mediation Committee                       | 0       |\n\nIf a Supervisory Board member is chair of more than one committee, compensation is only paid for the committee entitled to the highest amount. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board does not receive any additional compensation for chairing of the committees. Members of the committees also do not receive additional compensation.\n\nIn connection with the new regulation of Supervisory Board Compensation, the General Meeting resolved to approve the following transitional regulations with effect from May 17, 2023:\n\nIf  the  amount  of  the  Supervisory  Board  Compensation  does  not  exceed  the  Supervisory  Board  Compensation previously paid in the individual case (calculated compensation for the 2023 financial year based on the previous regulation in the Articles of Association), a member of the Supervisory Board whose current term of office began before May 17, 2023, will receive a compensating payment in the form of a cash payment in the amount of the difference  between  the  previously  granted  Supervisory  Board  Compensation  and  the  Supervisory  Board Compensation pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 14 of the Articles of Association. In the event of a reelection as member of the Supervisory Board, the provisions of the Articles of Association in the version adopted on May 17, 2023, apply.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board whose current term of office began before May 17, 2023, will receive the virtual shares cumulatively earned during the current term of office paid out in February 2024 on the basis of the average closing price during the last 10 trading days of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) of the preceding January.\n\nThe compensation determined will be paid to the respective member of the Supervisory Board by, at the latest, two months after submitting invoices and as a rule within the first three months of the following year.\n\nIn case of a change in Supervisory Board membership during the year, compensation for the financial year will be paid on a pro rata basis, rounded up/down to full months.\n\nThe company reimburses the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses they incur in the performance of their office, including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any employer contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their Supervisory Board work shall be paid for each Supervisory Board member affected. Finally, the Supervisory Board Chairman will be reimbursed appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his function and reimbursed for costs for the security measures required based on his function.\n\nIn the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board will be included in an appropriate amount in any financial liability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this are paid by the company. A deductible does not have to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board.",

For the year of departure, the entire compensation was paid in cash; a forfeiture regulation applied to 25% of the compensation for that financial year.\n\nThe company reimbursed the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses incurred in the performance of their office, including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses.

For a clearer overview, the compensation for the 2023 financial year is first shown separately based on the compensation provisions applicable until May 17, 2023, and then based on the new compensation provision applicable since that date. In each case the calculation is rounded up/down to full months.\n\n|                                  | Compensation for the 2023 financial year for the period from January 1, 2023 to May 17, 2023  1

The information provided pursuant to Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act will be successively expanded with the change from one financial year to the prior year until a reporting period of five years is reached. Starting with the 2025 financial year, the year-to-year changes will be shown for each of the past five years.\n\nThe information on the compensation of the current and former members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board reflects the individualized statement in the Compensation Report of the paid or owed compensation pursuant to Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The presentation of the development of the company's earnings is to reflect, according to the legal requirements, those of the stand-alone listed company, i.e. Deutsche Bank AG. Accordingly, the net income (net loss) of Deutsche Bank AG is used to present earnings within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. As the Management Board compensation is measured on the basis of Group figures, the earnings figures for the Group are additionally shown for the comparative presentation. These Group earnings figures are net income (net loss), cost/income ratio and Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE). For the group of employees for the comparison, the data relevant for Deutsche Bank Group were used in light of Deutsche Bank's global workforce. The group of employees for the comparison comprises all of the employees worldwide of Deutsche Bank Group.\n\n|                                                                  | 2023   | 2022                                       | 2021   | 2020               | Annual  change  from 2023  to 2022  in %   | Annual  change  from 2022  to 2021  in %   | Annual  change  from 2021  to 2020  in %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

We have not audited the content of the disclosures in section 'Compensation of the employees' where they go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board\n\nThe executive directors and supervisory board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration  report  and  the  related  disclosures  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Sec.  162  AktG.  In  addition,  the executive directors and supervisory board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the remuneration report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the remuneration report for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG. We do not express an opinion on the content of the abovementioned disclosures of the remuneration report that go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.\n\n## Other matter -formal audit of the remuneration report\n\nThe  audit  of  the  content  of  the  remuneration  report  described  in  this  auditor's  report  comprises  the  formal  audit  of  the remuneration report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the remuneration report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the remuneration report in all material respects.",

In accordance with regulatory requirements, equivalent reports for 2023 are prepared for the following Significant Institutions within Deutsche Bank Group: BHW Bausparkasse AG, Germany; Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Luxembourg; Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank Mutui S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank S.A.E., Spain.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nEnsuring  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements  is  an  overarching  consideration  in  the  bank's  Group  Compensation Strategy. The bank strives to be at the forefront of implementing regulatory requirements with respect to compensation and will  continue  to  maintain  a  close  exchange  with  its  prudential  supervisor,  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  to  be  in compliance with all existing and new requirements.\n\nAs an EU-headquartered institution, Deutsche Bank is subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation/Directive (CRR/CRD) globally, as transposed into German national law in the German Banking Act and InstVV. These rules are applied to all of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries and branches world-wide to the extent required in accordance with Section 27 InstVV. As a Significant Institution within the meaning of InstVV, Deutsche Bank identifies all employees whose work is deemed to have a material impact on the overall risk profile (Material Risk Takers or MRTs) in accordance with the criteria stipulated in the German Baking Act and in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/923. Deutsche Bank identifies MRTs at a Group level, at the level of Significant Institutions and, in accordance with the German Banking Act, for all CRR institutions at a solo level.\n\nTaking into account more specific sectorial legislation and in accordance with InstVV, some of Deutsche Bank's subsidiaries (in particular within the DWS Group) fall under sector specific remuneration rules, such as the Alternative Investments Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) and the Investment Firm Directive (IFD) including the applicable local transpositions. MRTs are also identified in these subsidiaries. Identified employees are subject to the remuneration provisions outlined in the applicable Guidelines on sound remuneration policies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nDeutsche Bank takes into account the regulations targeted at employees who engage directly or indirectly with the bank's clients, for instance as per the local transpositions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II - MiFID II. Accordingly, specific provisions for employees deemed to be Relevant Persons are implemented with a view to ensuring that they act in the best interest of the bank's clients.\n\nWhere applicable, Deutsche Bank is also subject to specific rules and regulations implemented by local regulators. Many of these requirements are aligned with the InstVV. However, where variations are apparent, proactive and open discussions with regulators have enabled the bank to follow the local regulations whilst ensuring that any impacted employees or locations remain within the bank's overall Group Compensation Framework. This includes, amongst others, the compensation structures applied to Covered Employees in the United States under the requirements of the Federal Reserve Board as well as the requirements related to compensation recovery for executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In any case, the InstVV requirements are applied as minimum standards globally.",

In accordance with the German two-tier board structure, the Supervisory Board governs the compensation of the Management Board members while the Management Board oversees compensation matters for all other employees in the Group. Both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are supported by specific committees and functions, in particular the Compensation Control Committee (CCC), the Compensation Officer, and the Senior Executive Compensation Committee (SECC).\n\nIn  line  with  their  responsibilities,  the  bank's  control  functions  are  involved  in  the  design  and  application  of  the  bank's remuneration systems, in the identification of MRTs and in determining the total amount of VC. This includes assessing the impact of employees' behavior and the business-related risks, performance criteria, granting of remuneration and severances as well as ex-post risk adjustments.\n\n## Reward governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Does not comprise a complete list of Supervisory Board Committees\n\n## Compensation Control Committee (CCC)\n\nThe Supervisory Board has set up the CCC to support in establishing and monitoring the structure of the compensation system for  the  Management  Board  Members of Deutsche Bank AG. Furthermore, the CCC monitors the appropriateness of the compensation systems for the employees of Deutsche Bank Group, as established by the Management Board and the SECC. The CCC reviews whether the total amount of variable compensation is affordable and set in accordance with the risk, capital and liquidity  situation  as  well  as  in  alignment  with  the  business  and  risk  strategies.  Furthermore,  the  CCC  supports  the Supervisory Board in monitoring the MRT identification process.\n\nThe CCC consists of the Supervisory Board Chairperson as well as two other Supervisory Board Members representing shareholders and three Supervisory Board Members representing employees. The Committee held seven meetings in the calendar year 2023. The members of the Risk Committee attended two meetings as guests, the Chairperson of the Risk Committee attended four meetings as guest. The Chairperson of the CCC is also a member of the Risk Committee. Further details can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board within the Annual Report.",

The Compensation Officer is involved in the conceptual review, development, monitoring and application of the employees' compensation systems, the MRT identification and remuneration disclosures on an ongoing basis. The Compensation Officer performs all relevant monitoring obligations independently, provides an assessment on the appropriateness  of  the  design  and  strategy  of  the  compensation  systems  for  employees  at  least  annually  and  regularly supports and advises the CCC.\n\n## Senior Executive Compensation Committee (SECC)\n\nThe SECC is a delegated committee established by the Management Board which has the mandate to develop sustainable compensation principles, to prepare recommendations on Total Compensation levels and to ensure appropriate compensation governance and oversight. The SECC establishes the Compensation and Benefits Strategy, Policy and corresponding guiding principles. Moreover, using quantitative and qualitative factors, the SECC assesses Group and divisional performance as a basis for compensation decisions and makes recommendations to the Management Board regarding the total amount of annual variable compensation and its allocation across business divisions and infrastructure functions.\n\nIn order to maintain its independence, only representatives from infrastructure and control functions who are not aligned to any  of  the  business  divisions  are  members  of  the  SECC.  In  2023,  the  SECC's  membership  comprised  of  the  DB  AG Management Board member responsible for Human Resources and the Chief Financial Officer as Co-Chairpersons, the Head of Compliance, the Head of Performance & Reward as well as an additional representative from both Finance and Risk as voting members. The Compensation Officer, the Deputy Compensation Officer and an additional representative from Finance participated as non-voting members. The SECC generally meets on a monthly basis but with more frequent meetings during the compensation process. It held 19 meetings in total with regard to the compensation process for the performance year 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Group Compensation Framework\n\nThe compensation framework, generally applicable globally across all regions and business lines, emphasizes an appropriate balance between Fixed Pay (FP) and Variable Compensation (VC) - together forming Total Compensation (TC). It aligns incentives  for  sustainable  performance  at  all  levels  of  Deutsche  Bank  whilst  ensuring  the  transparency  of  compensation decisions and their impact on shareholders and employees. The underlying principles of the compensation framework are applied to all employees equally, irrespective of differences in seniority, tenure, gender or ethnicity.\n\nPursuant to CRD and the requirements subsequently adopted in the German Banking Act, Deutsche Bank is subject to a maximum ratio of 1:1 with regard to fixed-to-variable remuneration components, which was increased to 1:2 for a limited population with shareholder approval on May 22, 2014 with an approval rate of 95.27%, based on valid votes by 27.68% of the share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting. Nonetheless, the bank has determined that employees in specific infrastructure functions (such as Legal, Group Tax and Human Resources) should in general continue to be subject to a maximum ratio of 1:1 while Control Functions as defined by InstVV are subject to a maximum ratio of 2:1. These Control Functions comprise Risk, Compliance, Anti-Financial Crime, Group Audit and the Compensation Officer and his Deputy.\n\nThe bank has assigned a Reference Total Compensation (RTC) to eligible employees that describes a reference value for their role. This value provides employees with orientation on their FP and VC. Actual individual TC can be at, above or below the Reference Total Compensation, depending on VC decisions.\n\nFixed  Pay  is  used  to  compensate  employees  for  their  skills,  experience  and  competencies,  commensurate  with  the requirements, size and scope of their role. The appropriate level of FP is determined with reference to the prevailing market rates for each role, internal comparisons and applicable regulatory requirements. FP plays a key role in order to attract and retain the right talent. For the majority of employees, FP is the primary compensation component.\n\nVariable Compensation reflects affordability and performance at Group, divisional, and individual level. It allows the bank to differentiate individual performance and to drive behavior through appropriate incentives that can positively influence culture. It also allows for flexibility in the cost base. For most employees globally, VC is granted as Individual VC and considers the applicable divisional and the employee's individual performance, conduct, and adherence to values and beliefs. In addition, it is subject to Group affordability and linked to Group performance. Employees who are not eligible for an award of Individual VC are granted a Group VC Component and may be nominated for a Recognition Award (where applicable). The Group VC Component reflects the bank's annual achievements in reaching its strategic targets whilst Recognition Awards provide the opportunity to acknowledge and reward outstanding contributions made by the employees of lower seniority levels in a timely and transparent manner.\n\n## Key components of the compensation framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In  the  context  of  InstVV,  severance  payments are  considered  variable  compensation.  The  bank's  severance  framework ensures full alignment with the respective InstVV requirements.\n\nEmployee benefits complement Total Compensation and are considered FP from a regulatory perspective, as they have no direct  link  to  performance  or  discretion.  They  are  granted  in  accordance  with  applicable  local  market  practices  and requirements. Pension expenses represent the main element of the bank's benefits portfolio globally.\n\n## Employee groups with specific compensation structures\n\nFor some areas of the bank, compensation structures apply that deviate, within regulatory boundaries, in some aspects from the Group Compensation Framework outlined above.\n\n## Postbank units\n\nWhile generally executive staff of former Postbank follow the remuneration structure of Deutsche Bank, the compensation for any other staff in Postbank units is based on specific frameworks agreed with trade unions or with the respective workers' councils. Where no collective agreements exist, compensation is subject to individual contracts. In general, non-executive and tariff staff in Postbank units receive VC, but the structure and portion of VC can differ between legal entities.\n\n## DWS\n\nThe vast majority of DWS asset management entities and employees fall under AIFMD, UCITS or IFD, while a limited number of employees remain in scope of the bank's Group Compensation Framework and InstVV. DWS has established its own compensation governance, policy, and structures, as well as Risk Taker identification process in line with AIFMD/UCITS/IFD requirements.  These  structures  and  processes  are  aligned  with  InstVV  where  required  but  tailored  towards  the  Asset Management business. Pursuant to the ESMA/EBA Guidelines, DWS's compensation strategy is designed to ensure an appropriate ratio between fixed and variable compensation.\n\nGenerally, DWS applies remuneration rules that are equivalent to the Deutsche Bank Group approach, but use DWS Grouprelated parameters, where possible. Notable deviations from the Group Compensation Framework include the use of sharebased instruments linked to DWS shares and fund-linked instruments. These serve to improve the alignment of employee compensation with DWS' shareholders' and investors' interests.\n\n## Tariff staff\n\nWithin  Deutsche  Bank  Group  there  are  17,105  tariff  employees  in  Germany  (based  on  full-time  equivalent  as of December 31, 2023). Tariff staff are either subject to a collective agreement ( Tarifvertrag f\u00fcr das private Bankgewerbe und die  \u00f6ffentlichen  Banken ),  as  negotiated  between  trade  unions  and  employer  associations,  or  subject  to  agreements  as negotiated with the respective trade unions directly. The remuneration of tariff staff is included in the quantitative disclosures in this Report.",

        "page_content": "## Determination of performance-based variable compensation\n\nThe bank puts a strong focus on its governance related to compensation decision-making processes. A robust set of rulebased principles for compensation decisions with close links to the performance of both business and individual were applied.\n\nThe total amount of VC for any given performance year is derived from an assessment of the bank's profitability, solvency, and liquidity position, and the determination of VC pools for divisions and infrastructure functions based on their performance in support of achieving the bank's strategic objectives.\n\nIn a first step, Deutsche Bank assesses the bank's profitability, solvency and liquidity position in line with its Risk Appetite Framework, including a holistic review against the bank's multi-year strategic plan to determine what the bank 'can' award in line with regulatory requirements (i.e., Group affordability). During this assessment, the bank also considers other limitations such as cost constraints. The proportion of the VC pools that is related to Group performance is determined based on the performance of a selected number of Group's KPIs, such as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) Capital Ratio, Cost/Income Ratio (CIR), Post-Tax Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE), ESG - Sustainable Finance Volume, Gender Diversity and Control Risk Management Grade. In the next step, the bank assesses divisional risk-adjusted performance, i.e. what the bank 'should' award in order to provide an appropriate compensation for contributions to the bank's success.\n\nWhen assessing divisional performance, a range of considerations are referenced. Performance is assessed in the context of financial and - based on Balanced Scorecards - non-financial targets. The financial targets for front-office divisions are subject to appropriate risk-adjustment, in particular by referencing the degree of future potential risks to which Deutsche Bank may be  exposed,  and  the  amount  of  capital  required  to  absorb  severe  unexpected  losses  arising  from  these  risks.  For  the infrastructure functions, the financial performance assessment is mainly based on the achievement of cost targets. While the allocation of VC to infrastructure functions, and in particular to control functions, depends on both Deutsche Bank's overall and their own performance, it is not dependent on the performance of the division(s) that these functions oversee.\n\nAt the level of the individual employee, the Variable Compensation Guiding Principles are established, which detail the factors and metrics that have to be taken into account when making Individual VC decisions. Managers must fully appreciate the risktaking activities of individuals to ensure that VC allocations are balanced and risk-taking is not inappropriately incentivized. The factors and metrics to be considered include, but are not limited to, (i) business delivery ('What'), i.e. quantitative and qualitative financial, risk-adjusted and non-financial performance metrics, and (ii) behavior ('How'), i.e. culture, conduct and control considerations such as qualitative inputs from control functions or disciplinary sanctions. Generally, performance is assessed based on a one-year period. However, for Management Board members of Significant Institutions, the performance across three years is taken into account.",

        "page_content": "## Variable compensation structure\n\nThe compensation structures are designed to provide a mechanism that promotes and supports long-term performance of employees and the bank. Whilst a portion of VC is paid upfront, these structures require that an appropriate portion is deferred to ensure alignment to the sustainable performance of the Group. For both parts of VC, Deutsche Bank shares are used as instruments and as an effective way to align compensation with Deutsche Bank's sustainable performance and the interests of shareholders.\n\nThe bank continues to go beyond regulatory requirements with the scope as well as the amount of VC that is deferred and the minimum  deferral  periods  for  certain  employee  groups.  The  deferral  rate  and  period  are  determined  based  on  the  risk categorization of the employee as well as the business unit. Where applicable, the bank starts to defer parts of variable compensation for MRTs where VC is set at or above \u20ac 50,000 or where VC exceeds 1/3 of TC. For non-MRTs, deferrals start at  higher  levels  of  VC.  MRTs  are  on  average  subject  to  deferral  rates  in  excess  of  the  minimum  40%  (60%  for  Senior Management) as required by InstVV. For MRTs in Material Business Units (MBU) the bank applies a deferral rate of at least 50%. The VC threshold for MRTs requiring at least 60% deferral is set at \u20ac 500,000. Moreover, for all employees whose FP exceeds the amount of \u20ac 500,000, the full amount of the VC is deferred.\n\nAs detailed in the table below, deferral periods range from three to five years, dependent on employee groups.\n\n## Overview on 2023 award types (excluding DWS Group)\n\nRetention\n\n| Award Type                                   | Description                                                                                      | Beneficiaries                                                           | Deferral Period                                                                    | Period              | Portion                                             |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Upfront:  Cash VC                            | Upfront cash                                                                                     | All eligible  employees                                                 | N/A                                                                                | N/A                 | 100% of VC, except  employees with  deferred awards |\n| Upfront:  Equity Upfront Award  (EUA)        | Upfront equity (linked to  Deutsche Bank's share price  over the retention period)               | MRTs with VC \u2265  \u20ac 50,000 or where  VC exceeds 1/3 of  TC  Non-MRTs with | N/A                                                                                | 12 months           | 50% of upfront VC                                   |\n| Deferred:  Restricted Incentive  Award (RIA) | Deferred cash                                                                                    | All employees with  deferred VC                                         | Equal tranche vesting:  MRTs: 4 years  Senior Mgmt. 1 : 5 years  Non-MRTs: 3 years | N/A                 | 50% of deferred VC                                  |\n| Deferred:  Restricted Equity  Award (REA)    | Deferred equity (linked to  Deutsche Bank's share price  over the vesting and retention  period) | All employees with  deferred VC                                         | Equal tranche vesting:  MRTs: 4 years  Senior Mgmt. 1 : 5 years  Non-MRTs: 3 years | 12 months  for MRTs | 50% of deferred VC                                  |\n\nEmployees are not allowed to sell, pledge, transfer or assign a deferred award or any rights in respect to the award.

These  requirements  form  the overarching  framework  for  determining  compensation  at  Deutsche  Bank.  In  particular,  management  must  ensure  that compensation decisions are not detrimental to maintaining the bank's sound capital base and liquidity reserves.\n\nDespite  a  persistently  difficult  macroeconomic  environment,  Deutsche  Bank  has  demonstrated  resilience  and  achieved sustainable business growth and revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit of \u20ac 5.7 billion.\n\n2023 was a successful year for Deutsche Bank, further proving the strength of its Global Hausbank model: a client centric approach coupled with targeted investment decisions, without losing focus on continued cost discipline, capital generation and strong controls. The bank reconfirmed a measured and forward-looking approach when deciding on variable compensation for 2023. This approach balanced the need to grow sustainably whilst remaining within the boundaries of cost commitments as well as remunerating employees fairly and competitively based on performance. This resulted in VC levels for 2023 that are  more  conservative  than  the  bank's  financial  performance  might  have  indicated.  As  in  previous  years,  the  SECC continuously monitored and reviewed the implications of potential VC awards, both for the bank's capital and liquidity base and for its ambitious cost targets.\n\nWith due consideration for all these factors, the Management Board determined that the bank is in a position to award variable compensation, including a year-end performance-based VC pool, of \u20ac 1.996 billion for 2023 (2022: \u20ac 2.126 billion). The VC for the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG was determined, as always, by the Supervisory Board in a separate process, but is included in the tables and charts below.\n\nAs part of the overall 2023 VC awards granted in March 2024, the Group VC Component was awarded to all eligible employees in line with the assessment of the four defined KPI categories which are outlined in the Group Compensation Framework chapter of this Report. The Management Board determined a payout rate of 70% for the Group VC Component in 2023, compared to 80% in 2022 and 77.5% in 2021.\n\n## Compensation awards for 2023 - all employees\n\n|                                             | 2023    2022           | 2023    2022           | 2023    2022   | 2023    2022   | 2023    2022     | 2023    2022   | 2023    2022            | 2023    2022                           | 2023    2022   | 2023    2022                |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| in \u20ac m.

        "page_content": "## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, supervises and advises the Management Board and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. Supervision and advice also include in particular, sustainability issues. The Supervisory Board works together closely with the Management Board in a cooperative relationship of trust and for the benefit of the company. The internal organization of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as the requirements for its members are subject not only to the regulations of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz (KWG)) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (CGCG), but also to specific supervisory requirements Such requirements are founded on, among other things, the German Banking Act (KWG), the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsverg\u00fctungsverordnung (InstitutsVergV)), the guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the administrative practices of the European Central Bank (ECB) as our prudential supervisory authority. In individual cases, the regulatory requirements may diverge from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC).\n\nThe types of business that require the approval of the Supervisory Board to be transacted are specified in the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank AG. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board may specify additional transactions that require its approval.\n\nThe procedures of the Supervisory Board and the tasks and procedures of the Supervisory Board committees are set out in their respective terms of reference, which are published on Deutsche Bank's website (www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm) in their currently applicable versions. The Supervisory Board meets regularly also without the Management Board. In addition, the representatives of the employees and the representatives of the shareholders regularly conduct preliminary discussions separately. The number of meetings and their execution are specified in the Report of the Supervisory Board, along with details on the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Supervisory Board and has a leadership role in this. He can issue internal guidelines and principles concerning the Supervisory Board's internal organization and communications, the coordination of the work within the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board's interaction with the Management Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board engages in investor discussions on Supervisory Boardrelated topics when necessary and regularly informs the Supervisory Board of the substance of such discussions. These also cover Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee furthermore conducts regular discussions with the auditor outside the meetings.\n\nBetween meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and, to the extent expedient, the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees maintain regular contact with the members of the Management Board, especially with the Chairman of the Management Board, and deliberate with them, among other things, on issues of Deutsche Bank Group's strategy, planning, the development of its business, risk situation, risk management, risk controlling, governance, compliance, compensation systems, IT, data and digitalization, sustainability as well as material litigation cases. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and - within their respective functional responsibility - the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees are informed without delay by the Chairman of the Management Board or by the respectively responsible Management Board member about important events of material significance for the assessment of the situation, development and management of Deutsche Bank Group.\n\nTogether  with  the  Management  Board,  the  Supervisory  Board  arranges  for  a  long-term  succession  planning.  Promoting diversity on the Management Board is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it is intensively addressing the topic. It is actively working on Management Board diversity, e.g., in terms of gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds and mindsets. The Nomination Committee supports the Chairman's Committee and the Supervisory Board in identifying suitable  candidates  to  fill  a  position  on  the  bank's  Management  Board.  In  doing  so,  the  Committee  prepares  a  position description with a candidate profile and states the expected time commitment. Suitable candidates are identified, in some cases in collaboration with external recruiting consultants, and structured interviews are conducted. Besides this succession planning with external candidates, the Management Board and Supervisory Board maintain a list of internal candidates. The Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board regularly receive reports from the Management Board on internal candidates for  succession  planning  and  the  process  from  the  perspective  of  the  Management  Board.  For  the  selection  of  suitable candidates, external and internal, the Nomination Committee takes into account the balance and diversity of the knowledge, skills and experience of all members of the Management Board. It also seeks to foster diversity on the Management Board, for example, with regard to gender, nationality and age.",

        "page_content": "Building on the work of the Nomination Committee, the Chairman's Committee submits a recommendation for the Supervisory Board's resolution. Based on this, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment of Management Board members. The first appointment period is for a maximum of three years. Management Board members can be reappointed for one or several terms of office, which may be for a maximum of five years pursuant to the law, whereby at Deutsche Bank such reappointments should generally also be for a maximum of three years. Besides proposals for the appointment of members of the Management Board,  the  Chairman's  Committee  also  submits  proposals  for  the  dismissal  of  Management  Board  members,  which  the Supervisory Board decides on.\n\nThe Supervisory Board ensures compliance with the legally required minimum gender participation pursuant to Section 76 (3a) of  the  Stock  Corporation Act (AktG). The Management Board comprised ten members until May 17, 2023, including two women: Christiana Riley and Rebecca Short. Christiana Riley decided to leave the bank, so the Management Board, reduced in size to nine members since then, has one female member: Rebecca Short. Internal and external feedback on the smaller Management Board has generally been with very positive in recognition of its efficiency. As stated at the General Meeting 2023, the Supervisory Board is not satisfied, however, with the current ratio of women and intends to raise the percentage of women in the future. To increase the number of suitable internal female candidates, the Supervisory Board set a corresponding objective for the Management Board for the current financial year for appointing women to senior management positions directly below the Management Board and embedded this objective within the long-term performance metrics of the new compensation system for the Management Board. To reach a 100% achievement level in this category, at least 32,5% females need to be represented below the two levels of the Management Board by end 2026.\n\nBased on proposals of the Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the total compensation of the individual members of the Management Board and also regularly reviews and resolves on the compensation system for the Management Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board receives reports from the Management Board within the scope prescribed by law or administrative guidelines, in particular on all issues of relevance for the Group concerning strategy, intended business policy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management, staff development, reputation and compliance. Furthermore, Group Audit informs the Audit Committee of any deficiencies identified regularly and - in the case of severe deficiencies - without undue delay. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is informed of any serious findings relating to the members of  the  Management  Board.  The  Supervisory  Board  and  Management  Board  adopted  an  Information  Regime,  a  general engagement (interaction) protocol and another engagement (interaction) protocol specifically for regulatory topics. These regulate not only the reporting to the Supervisory Board, but also, among other things the Supervisory Board's enquiries and requests  for  information  from  employees  of  the  company  as  well  as  the  exchange  of  information  in  connection  with preparations for the meetings and between the meetings.\n\nThe Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board addressed the assessment of the Supervisory Board which is to be conducted at least annually as prescribed by law pursuant to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and which is also the self-assessment of the Supervisory Board pursuant to Section D.12 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). The concrete implementation of and the schedule for the assessment were deliberated on and set out at the meeting of the Nomination Committee on October 23, 2023. Services of an external advisor were not mandated in this context. The assessment was performed essentially on the basis of extensive questionnaires regarding the work of the Supervisory Board, of the Supervisory Board committees and of the Management Board, interviews conducted by members of the Nomination Committee with the individual members of the Management Board, and an assessment of the individual members of both the Management Board and Supervisory Board. The final discussion and approval of the results of the assessment took place at the Supervisory Board meeting in plenum on January 31, 2024, and the results were set out in a written final report. The Supervisory Board continues to hold the opinion that the Supervisory Board and Management Board have achieved a high standard and that there are no reservations, in particular, regarding the professional qualifications, personal reliability and time availability of the members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board.",

The  suitability  of  each  individual  member  is  assessed, determined  and  continuously  monitored  both  internally  by  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Supervisory  Board  and externally by the regulatory authorities. This suitability assessment covers the expertise, reliability and time available of each individual member (individual suitability). In addition, there is an assessment of the entire Supervisory Board's knowledge, skills  and  experience  that  are  necessary  for  the  performance  of  its  tasks  (collective  suitability).  Passing  the  suitability assessment of the European Central Bank (ECB) after the mandate is accepted and the continual suitability of the Supervisory Board member during the entire mandate with Deutsche Bank AG are mandatory regulatory prerequisites for the performance of the tasks as a member of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board confirmed its adopted Profile of Requirements at its meeting on July 27, 2023. The Supervisory Board specified general fields of expertise and expanded fields of expertise.\n\n## General fields of expertise:\n\nIdeally, every member of the Supervisory Board possesses these individual qualifications.\n\n- -Understanding of commercial business issues\n- -Analytical and strategic mindset\n- -Understanding of the German corporate governance system, and - as a result - an understanding of a Supervisory Board member's responsibilities\n- -Understanding of the business model and the structure of Deutsche Bank AG\n- -Basic understanding of the financial services sector, e. g. (i) knowledge in the areas of banking, financial services, financial markets, financial industry, including the bank's home market as well as Europe and the bank's key markets outside Europe, and (ii) knowledge of the relevant clients for the bank, the market's expectations and the operational environment.\n\nThe fulfillment of these fields of expertise is reported on in summary in the qualification matrix in the line 'General fields of expertise'.\n\n## Expanded fields of expertise:\n\nThese fields of expertise refer to the Supervisory Board in its entirety (collective suitability). The Supervisory Board, as  a whole, must have an understanding of the specified fields of expertise that is appropriate for the size  and complexity of Deutsche Bank AG. They are derived from the bank's business model and from specific laws and regulations that apply to the bank. The fields of expertise are:\n\nAccounting, including sustainability reporting:\n\n- -Accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and German Commercial Code (HGB)) and auditing of annual financial statements\n- -Taxation\n\nRegulatory framework and legal requirements:\n\n- -Understanding of the key legal framework conditions in the countries in which the company has its main operations\n- -Understanding of the key relevant legal systems for the bank\n- -Experience in the executive management / supervisory board of large enterprises\n- -Regulatory framework and legal requirements, in particular, knowledge of the legal systems relevant for the bank\n- -Knowledge of the social, political and regulatory expectations in the home market\n\nHuman capital, compensation and corporate culture:\n\n- -Human resources and staff management\n- -Compensation and compensation systems\n- -Selection procedure for management body members and assessment of their suitability\n- -Corporate culture",

All members act with independence of mind, i.e., all members of the Supervisory Board engage actively in their duties and are able to make their own sound, objective and independent decisions and judgements when performing their functions and responsibilities. In the preceding financial year, there were no former members of the Management Board on the Supervisory Board.",

Overboarding, i.e. holding an inadmissible number of board directorships in different companies, is determined on the basis of the statutory regulation in Section 25d (3) of the German Banking Act (KWG). A Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of five companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). If a Supervisory Board member is also an executive director of a company, this Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of three companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). The decisive factors for determining if this is the case are the supervisory authority's regulatory requirements in consideration of the local laws. Compliance with this statutory regulation is continually monitored by the regulatory authorities. In the event of directorship overboarding, the supervisory authorities may require that Deutsche Bank AG revoke a Supervisory Board member's appointment and prohibit this Supervisory Board member from performing his or her work\n- ** Definition of independence: A Supervisory Board member is independent when there are no personal or business relations with Deutsche Bank or its Management Board that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. The Supervisory Board issued guidelines for the consistent assessment of the independence of its members back in 2017 and updates them regularly. These guidelines also take into account the regulatory requirements on independence. The bank has no controlling shareholder at present\n- *** Definition of experts given in the 'Auditing and Controlling' section of this report",

        "page_content": "There is a regular maximum age limit of 70. In well-founded, individual cases, a Supervisory Board member may be elected or appointed for a period that extends at the latest until the end of the fourth Ordinary General Meeting that takes place after he or she has reached the age of 70. This age limit was taken into account in the election proposals to the General Meeting and shall also be taken into account for the next Supervisory Board elections or subsequent appointments for Supervisory Board positions that become vacant.\n\nFor shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, the length of Supervisory Board membership shall not, as a rule, exceed 12 years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board respects diversity when proposing its members for appointment. In light of the international operations of Deutsche Bank AG, care should be taken that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of members with longterm international experience. Currently, the professional careers or private lives of six members of the Supervisory Board are centered outside Germany. Furthermore, all of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have many years of  international  experience  from  their  current  or  former  activities,  for  example,  as  management  board  members  or  chief executive officers or in a comparable executive function of corporations or organizations with international operations. The Supervisory Board believes that in these two ways the international activities of the company are sufficiently taken into account. The objective is to retain the currently existing international profile.\n\nSpecial importance has already been attached to an appropriate consideration of women in the selection process since the Supervisory Board elections in 2008. For the election proposals to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board takes into account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the legal requirements according to which the Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. In reviewing potential candidates for a new election or subsequent appointments to Supervisory Board positions that have become vacant, qualified women are included in the selection process and appropriately considered in the election proposals. At the end of the financial year, five women and five men were members of the Supervisory Board on the employee representatives' side and three women and seven men on the shareholder representatives' side. The statutory minimum quota of 30% has thus been fulfilled for many years now.\n\nThe average age of the Supervisory Board members was 57.25 as of December 31, 2023. The age structure is diverse, ranging from 39 to 68 years of age and spanning three generations, according to the general definition of the term.\n\nThe length of membership on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG ranged from under one year to around 10 years at the end of the financial year. The average length of membership on the Supervisory Board as of December 31, 2023, was 3.2 years.\n\nThe diverse range of the members' educational and professional backgrounds includes banking, business administration, economics,  auditing,  law,  German  studies,  political  science,  electrical  engineering  and  healthcare.  The  resumes  of  the members of the Supervisory Board are published on Deutsche Bank's website (www.db.com/ir/en/supervisory-board.htm).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board do not exercise functions on a management body of, or perform advisory duties at, major competitors. Material conflicts of interest involving a member of the Supervisory Board that are not merely temporary shall result in the termination of that member's Supervisory Board mandate. Members of the Supervisory Board may not, according to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and shall not, according to the recommendations under C.4 and C.5 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), hold more than the allowed number of supervisory board mandates or  mandates in  supervisory  bodies  of  companies  which  have  similar  requirements.  These  requirements  were  met  in  the preceding financial year.\n\nSome members of the Supervisory Board are, or were last year, in high-ranking positions at other companies that Deutsche Bank has business relations with. Business transactions with these companies were conducted under the same conditions as those between unrelated third parties. In the opinion of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, these transactions did not affect the independence of the Supervisory Board members involved.",

        "page_content": "## Principal accountant fees and services\n\nIn accordance with German law, Deutsche Bank's principal accountant is appointed at the Annual General Meeting based on a recommendation of Deutsche Bank's Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board prepares such a recommendation. Subsequent to the principal accountant's appointment, the Audit Committee awards the contract and in its sole authority approves the terms and scope of the audit and all audit engagement fees as well as monitors the principal accountant's independence. EY GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('EY') was the bank's principal accountant for the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, respectively.\n\nThe tables set forth below contain the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years by EY in each of the following categories: (1) Audit fees, which are fees for professional services for the audit of Deutsche Bank's annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years, (2) Audit-related fees, which are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the  performance  of  the  audit  or  review  of  the  bank's  financial  statements  and  are  not  reported  as  Audit  fees,  (3) Taxrelated fees,  which  are  fees  for  professional  services  rendered  for  tax  compliance,  tax  consulting  and  tax  planning,  and (4) All other fees, which are fees for products and services other than Audit fees, Audit-related fees and Tax-related fees. These amounts include expenses and exclude Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\n## Fees billed by EY\n\n| Fee category in \u20ac m.   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fees             |     66 |     59 |\n| Audit-related fees     |     12 |      8 |\n| Tax-related fees       |      0 |      0 |\n| All other fees         |      0 |      1 |\n| Total fees             |     78 |     68 |\n\nThe  Audit  fees  include  fees  for  professional  services  for  the  audit  of  Deutsche  Bank's  annual  financial  statements  and consolidated financial statements and do not include audit fees for DWS and its subsidiaries that are not audited by EY. The Audit-related fees include fees for other assurance services required by law or regulations, in particular for financial service specific attestation, for quarterly reviews, for spin-off audits and for merger audits, as well as fees for voluntary assurance services, like voluntary audits for internal management purposes and the issuance of comfort letters. The bank's Tax-related fees include fees for services relating to the preparation and review of tax returns and related compliance assistance and advice, tax consultation and advice relating to Group tax planning strategies and initiatives and assistance with assessing compliance with tax regulations.\n\nUnder SEC regulations, the principal accountant fees are required to be presented as follows: audit fees were \u20ac 68 million in 2023 compared to \u20ac 61 million in 2022, audit-related fees were \u20ac 10 million in 2023 compared to \u20ac 6 million in 2022, tax-related fees  were  \u20ac 0 million  in  2023  compared  to  \u20ac 0 million  in  2022,  and  all  other  fees  were  \u20ac 0 million  in  2023  compared  to \u20ac 1 million in 2022.\n\nUnited States law and regulations, and the bank's own policies, generally require that all engagements of Deutsche Bank's principal accountant be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by it. The bank's Audit Committee has adopted the following policies and procedures for consideration and approval of requests to engage the principal  accountant  to  perform  non-audit  services.  Engagement  requests  must  in  the  first  instance  be  submitted  to  the Accounting  Engagement  Team.  If  the  request  relates  to  services  that  would  impair  the  independence  of  the  principal accountant, the request must be rejected. The bank's Audit Committee has given its pre-approval for specified assurance, financial  advisory  and  tax  services,  provided  the  expected  fees  for  any  such  service  do  not  exceed  \u20ac 1 million.  If  the engagement request relates to such specified pre-approved services, it may be approved by the Accounting Engagement Team and must thereafter be reported to the Audit Committee. If the engagement request relates neither to prohibited nonaudit services nor to pre-approved non-audit services, it must be forwarded to the Audit Committee for consideration. In addition, to facilitate the consideration of engagement requests between its meetings, the Audit Committee has delegated approval authority to several of its members who are 'independent' as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Such members are required to report any approvals made by them to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.\n\nAdditionally, United States law and regulations permit the pre-approval requirement to be waived with respect to engagements for non-audit services aggregating to no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues the bank paid to the principal accountant, if such engagements were not recognized by the bank at the time of engagement and were promptly brought to the attention of the bank's Audit Committee or a designated member thereof and approved prior to the completion of the audit. In 2022 and 2023, the percentage of the total amount of revenues Deutsche Bank paid to its principal accountant for nonaudit services that was subject to such a waiver was less than 5% for each year.",

The last Declaration of Conformity was issued on October 26, 2022. Since then, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft has complied with the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code' in the version of the Code dated April 28, 2022, published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 27, 2022, and will continue to will continue with them in the future, with the exception of the following deviation:\n- With regard to recommendation G.10 second sentence, according to which long-term variable remuneration components shall be accessible to a Management Board member only after a period of four years. The compensation system for the Management Board provides that the long-term components of variable compensation vest over a deferral period of five years. As this involves share-based compensation elements, these are subject to an additional holding period of one year after their vesting. With regard to the structure of the deferral period, the Supervisory Board members will in future already be able to dispose over a first part after three years and over the last part of the long-term  components  after  six  years.  The  Supervisory  Board  thus  remains  within  the  requirements  for  financial institutions set out in the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutionsverg\u00fctungsverordnung). We do not consider a  further  tightening  of  the  bank-specific  regulatory  requirements  to  be  appropriate.  We  declare  a  deviation  from  the recommendation, just like last year, although the Management Board members will not be able to dispose over the first part of the long-term component granted for the 2021 financial year until 2025 and for the 2022 financial year until 2026.\n- 2. The German Corporate Governance Code limits the applicability of the Code's recommendations to the credit institutions and insurance companies to the extent that the recommendations apply to them only insofar as there are no statutory provisions to the contrary.

The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft established a Nomination Committee in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG) whose tasks are to support the Supervisory Board in the following tasks:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying candidates to fill a position on the Management Board and preparing proposals for the election of members of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the under-represented gender on the Supervisory Board as well as a strategy for achieving this;\n- \u00b7 the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the structure, size, composition and performance of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board and making recommendations regarding this to the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board as well as of the respective body collectively; and\n- \u00b7 the review of the Management Board's principles for selecting and appointing persons to the upper management level and the recommendations made to the Management Board in this respect.\n\nThe Nomination Committee to be established in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) therefore has numerous tasks that go beyond the preparation of the election proposals for the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. A general exclusion of a supervisory board's employee representatives from a membership on a committee is only admissible, according to prevailing opinion, if there is a material reason for this. Whereas such a material reason can exist for a committee that solely handles the preparation of the proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives, a justification  for  the  exclusion  of  employee  representatives  is  lacking  for  a  nomination  committee  with  the  range  of  tasks assigned to it by the German Banking Act (KWG). Due to the Nomination Committee's range of mandatory tasks stipulated by  the  German  Banking  Act  (KWG)  and  the  inadmissibility  of  discriminating  against  employee  representatives  in  the composition of the committees, the recommendation in Section D.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code is therefore not applicable to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. Nonetheless, in order to take this recommendation into account, Section 2 (3) of the Terms of Reference for the Nomination Committee provides that the election proposals to the General Meeting are prepared only by the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Goals for the proportion of women in management positions/gender quota\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the percentage of women on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG is 40%. The statutory minimum of 30% pursuant to Section 96 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is thereby exceeded.\n\nThe current German Act to Supplement and Amed Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (F\u00fcPoG II)) requires that at least one woman and one man are to be appointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. With one woman, Rebecca Short, on the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG, the bank fulfilled the requirement as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDeutsche Bank is firmly convinced that an improved gender balance in leadership roles will meaningfully contribute to its future success.\n\nIn accordance with the legal framework conditions and based on the bank's own strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion, the bank is working on making progress on its ambitious goals of the '35 by 25' program that the Management Board set on May 4, 2021. By 2025 women should represent a minimum of 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President positions combined.\n\nThe goals for the representation of women on the two management levels below the Management Board are now for at least 30% women on the first management level and at least 30% women on the second management level below the Management Board. These goals are to be reached by December 31, 2025.\n\nThe population of staff on the  first  management level below the Management Board comprises Managing Directors and Directors who report directly to the Management Board and managers with comparable responsibilities. The population of staff on the second management level comprises Managing Directors and Directors who report to the first management level.\n\n## Implementing German gender quota legislation at Deutsche Bank AG\n\n|                                                | Goal   | Dec 31, 2023    Result   | Dec 31, 2022    Result   | Dec 31, 2021  Result   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Level (headcount, in %) 1                      |        |                          |                          |                        |\n| Supervisory Board                              | 30.0   | 40.0                     | 30.0                     | 30.0                   |\n| Management Board 2                             | 1.0    | 1.0                      | 2.0                      | 2.0                    |\n| Management Board level -1 3                    | 30.0   | 20.0                     | 17.1                     | 20.0                   |\n| Management Board level -2 3                    | 30.0   | 27.6                     | 29.6                     | 27.5                   |\n| Senior Corporate Titles (headcount, in %) 4,5  |        |                          |                          |                        |\n| Managing Directors, Directors, Vice Presidents | 35.0   | 32.3                     | 30.7                     | 29.9                   |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the proportion of women was 20.0% (2022: 17.1%) on the first management level below the Management Board and 27.6% (2022: 29.6%) on the second management level below the Management Board.\n\nWhile the bank's commitment to increase the representation of women in senior management positions is global, the bank's implementation is local. Each region and each business have their own diversity and inclusion needs because cultures and current social challenges differ from nation to nation and from business area to business area. However, the Management Board remains committed to these goals and focused initiatives are put in place to accelerate change. These initiatives apply to all phases of career development, spanning across talent recruitment, development, retention and promotions.\n\nWithin this framework, the bank's decisions on promotions and appointments are aligned, in particular, to the suitability of the candidates for the respective roles, their demonstrated performance and their future potential. In line with the bank's basic diversity concept, the bank also take into account the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of tasks and the necessary experience of the employees for the composition of the two levels below the Management Board.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity concept\n\nAs an integral part of Deutsche Bank's strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market in Germany, diversity is a decisive factor for the bank's success. Diversity, equity and inclusion help Deutsche Bank in forming and strengthening relationships with its clients and partners in the societies where the bank does business.\n\nAge and gender as well as educational and professional backgrounds have long been accepted as key aspects of the far more comprehensive understanding of diversity at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe bank is convinced that diversity, equity and inclusion stimulate innovation, for example, and helps the bank to take more balanced decisions and thus play a decisive role for the success of Deutsche Bank. Diversity and inclusion are therefore integral components of the bank's values and beliefs and its Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and Management Board strive to and should serve as role models for the bank regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. In accordance with the bank's values and beliefs specified above, diversity in the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board also facilitates the proper performance of the tasks and duties assigned to them by law, Articles of Association and Terms of Reference.\n\nBased on Deutsche Bank's understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion, the values and beliefs and the measures described in the following for their implementation also apply - to the extent legally admissible - to the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG. The Supervisory Board considers diversity in the company, in particular, when filling positions on the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG updated the Suitability Guideline for selecting members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG, which also continues to comprise diversity principles. This Suitability Guideline implements the 'Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders' issued jointly by the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority.\n\n## Diversity concept for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and its implementation are described above in the section 'Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity concept and status of implementation'.\n\n## Diversity concept and succession planning for the Management Board\n\nThrough the composition of the Management Board, it is to be ensured that its members have, at all times, the required knowledge, skills and experience necessary to properly perform their tasks. Accordingly, when selecting members for the Management Board, care is to be taken that they collectively have sufficient expertise and diversity within the meaning of the objectives specified above. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and Management Board are to ensure long-term succession planning.\n\nThe current German Act to Supplement and Amend Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (F\u00fcPoG II) requires that at least one woman and one man be appointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. The bank fulfilled this requirement as of December 31, 2023, as it has one woman on the Management Board. In general, a Management Board member should not be older at the end of his or her appointment period than the regular retirement age according to the rules of the statutory pension insurance scheme applicable in Germany for the long-term insured to claim an early retirement pension.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation\n\nIn accordance with the law, the Articles of Association and Terms of Reference, the Supervisory Board adopted a candidate profile for the members of the Management Board, based on a proposal from the Nomination Committee. This profile takes into  account  an  'Expertise  and  Capabilities  Matrix',  specifying,  among  other  things,  the  required  knowledge,  skills  and experience to perform the tasks as Management Board member, in order to successfully develop and implement the bank's strategy in the respective market or the respective division and as a management body collectively. The Management Board reviews succession plans for Management Board positions, both individually and as a group. Individual succession plans are reviewed and internal succession candidates are discussed in detail based on potential, leadership skills and experience as well as fit and proper suitability. As gender diversity is a key focus of Deutsche Bank, the respective succession metrics and data analytics support this process. After approval by the Management Board these plans are submitted to the Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board in principle at a meeting for extensive deliberation.\n\nIn identifying candidates to fill a position on the bank's Management Board, the Supervisory Board's Nomination Committee takes into account the appropriate diversity balance of all Management Board members collectively. Furthermore, it also considers the targets set by the Supervisory Board in accordance with statutory requirements for the percentage of women on the Management Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board with the periodic assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the Management Board in its entirety.\n\n## Results achieved in the 2023 financial year\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Management Board comprised one woman (11%) and eight men.\n\nThe age structure is diverse, ranging from 48 to 56 years of age as of December 31, 2023. The length of experience as member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank as of December 31, 2023, ranged from less than one year to around eight years.\n\nIn light of the bank's strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market in Germany, five of the nine Management Board members as of December 31, 2023 have a German background. Furthermore, the Management Board members come from Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. However, the ethnic diversity of the Management Board does not currently reflect the full diversity of the markets where the bank does business or the diversity of Deutsche Bank's employees.\n\nThe diverse  range  of  the  Management  Board  members'  educational  and  professional  backgrounds  includes  accounting, banking, business administration, economics, engineering finance, literature law and philosophy.\n\nThe bank transparently reports on Management Board diversity in addition to the information presented above in this Corporate Governance Report in the section 'Management Board and Supervisory Board:\n\nManagement Board' as well as on the bank's website: www.db.com (Heading: Investor Relations, 'Corporate Governance', 'Management Board').",

NonGAAP financial measures are measures of the Group's historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that contain adjustments that exclude or include amounts that are included or excluded, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Return on Equity Ratios\n\nThe Group reports a post-tax return on average shareholders' equity and a post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nThe post-tax returns on average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated as profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon) as a percentage of average shareholders' equity and average tangible shareholders' equity, respectively.\n\nProfit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon) for the segments is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as profit (loss) excluding post-tax profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon), which are allocated to segments based on their allocated average tangible shareholders' equity. For the Group, it reflects the reported effective tax rate, which was 14% for the full year 2023, (1)% for 2022 and 26% for 2021. For the segments, the applied tax rate was 28% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nAt  the  Group  level,  tangible  shareholders'  equity  is  shareholders'  equity  as  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet excluding goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity for the segments is calculated by deducting goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity as allocated to the segments. Shareholders' equity and tangible shareholders' equity are presented on an average basis.\n\nThe Group believes that a presentation of average tangible shareholders' equity makes comparisons to its competitors easier and refers to this measure in the return on equity ratios presented by the Group. However, average tangible shareholders' equity is not a measure provided for in IFRS, and the Group's ratios based on this measure should not be compared to other companies' ratios without considering differences in the calculations.\n\nThe reconciliation of the aforementioned ratios is set forth in the table below:\n\n|                                                 | 2023            | 2023             | 2023          | 2023              | 2023               | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------|\n| in \u20ac m.

Revenues excluding specific items is calculated by adjusting net revenues under IFRS for specific revenue items which generally fall outside the usual nature or scope of the business and are likely to distort an accurate assessment of the divisional operating performance. Excluded items are Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA) and material transactions or events that are either one-off in nature or belong to a portfolio of connected transactions or events where the P&L impact is limited to a specific period of time.

Tangible book value per basic share outstanding is computed by dividing tangible book value by period-end basic shares outstanding.\n\n## Tangible Book Value\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                               |         |         |         | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (unless stated otherwise)                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  |\n| Total shareholders' equity (Book  value)              | 64,486  | 61,959  | 58,027  | 2,527                                 | 4                                     | 3,932                                 | 7                                     |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets 1                | (6,573) | (6,327) | (6,079) | (246)                                 | 4                                     | (248)                                 | 4                                     |\n| Tangible shareholders' equity  (Tangible  book value) | 57,913  | 55,632  | 51,949  | 2,281                                 | 4                                     | 3,683                                 | 7                                     |\n\n1\n\n## Basic Shares Outstanding\n\n| in \u20ac m.                                               |         |         |         | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2023 increase (decrease)  from 2022   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   | 2022 increase (decrease)  from 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (unless stated otherwise)                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  | in \u20ac m.                               | in %                                  |\n| Number of shares                                      | 2,040.2 | 2,066.8 | 2,066.8 | (26.5)                                | (1.3)                                 | 0                                     | 0                                     |\n| Shares outstanding:                                   |         |         |         |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Treasury shares                                       | (48.2)  | (28.9)  | (0.7)   | (19.3)                                | 66.6                                  | (28.3)                                | N/M                                   |\n| Vested share awards                                   | 46.3    | 45.6    | 34.5    | 0.8                                   | 1.7                                   | 11.1                                  | 32.0                                  |\n| Basic shares outstanding                              | 2,038.4 | 2,083.4 | 2,100.6 | (45.0)                                | (2.2)                                 | (17.2)                                | (0.8)                                 |\n| Book value per basic share  outstanding in \u20ac          | 31.64   | 29.74   | 27.62   | 1.90                                  | 6.4                                   | 2.12                                  | 7.7                                   |\n| Tangible book value per basic share  outstanding in \u20ac | 28.41   | 26.70   | 24.73   | 1.71                                  | 6.4                                   | 1.97                                  | 8.0                                   |\n\n## CRR/CRD Regulatory measures\n\nThe Group's regulatory assets, exposures, risk-weighted assets, capital and ratios are calculated for regulatory purposes and are set forth throughout this document under the CRR/CRD as currently applicable.\n\nFor the comparatives as of December 31, 2021 certain figures are based on the CRR definition of own fund instruments (applicable for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital and Tier 2 capital and figures based thereon, including Tier 1, Total Capital and Leverage Ratio) are presented on a 'fully loaded' basis. Such fully loaded figures are calculated excluding the transitional arrangements for own fund instruments as provided in the currently applicable CRR/CRD. Deutsche Bank had immaterial amounts of such instruments outstanding at year end 2022 and 2023. For those comparatives periods the CET 1 and RWA figures include the transitional impacts from the IFRS 9 add-back also in the fully-loaded figures given it is an immaterial difference. Measures calculated pursuant to the Group's fully loaded methodology are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nDeutsche Bank believes that these fully loaded calculations provided useful information to investors as they reflected the bank's progress against then known future regulatory capital standards. Many of Deutsche Bank's competitors have been describing  calculations  on  a  fully  loaded  basis,  however,  competitors'  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  fully  loaded calculations may have varied such that the bank's fully loaded measures may not have been comparable with similarly labelled measures used by its competitors.",

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of Deutsche Bank. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which the bank derives a substantial portion of its revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of its assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, potential defaults of borrowers or trading counterparties, the implementation of the Group's strategic initiatives, the reliability of its risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks referenced in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors are described in detail in the bank's SEC Form 20-F of March 14, 2024, under the heading 'Risk Factors.'
