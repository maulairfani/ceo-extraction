For a second consecutive year, we increased the average rate of return on euro-denominated products by more than the market average to an average 2.80% for life insurance and 2.99% for individual pension contracts, while maintaining an attractive preferential PAB linked to the UA rate.\n\nIn property & casualty, we were there to support all our customers who had to make claims, particularly following the severe weather events that hit France late in the year.\n\nWe also continued to advance our One 2025 corporate project, making 2023 a year of great strategic progress for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. This was evidenced by the successful expansion of our partnerships in France, for example with Mobilize Financial Services, and our partnership with Banco BPM, which has made us the third largest non-life bancassurer in Italy.\n\nIn digital, we strengthened the self-care services offered through the banking applications Ma Banque and LCL Mes Comptes , seen as key to both business development and\n\nNICOLAS DENIS Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\ncustomer satisfaction where we score 91% in life and 93% in property/casualty.\n\nAs  a  committed  insurer,  we  have  accelerated  the development of our inclusive offers, notably by supporting young people to access home insurance.\n\nWe also supported the reform of crop insurance that came into force on 1 January 2023, in order to better cover farmers in the face of climate change risks, and to protect their farms.\n\nContinuing our responsible investment strategy, and as a player committed to the climate and the ecological transition, we are carrying a very significant share of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's and the market's efforts in the financing and investment in renewable energies, such as our stake in Innergex Renewable France and the fundraising of Verkor, a French start-up with the ambition of producing batteries for the low-carbon automotive industry in France.\n\nIn an uncertain environment, we aim to develop our ability to 'Predict and Repair' by giving everyone the means to better protect themselves, while continuing to improve the quality and scope of our services.\n\nWe are also proud to continue embodying our socially useful business, driven by the values of solidarity that are written into mutualist DNA of our Group and by our corporate commitment to 'act every day in the interest of our customers and society'.\n\nWith the support of our partner banks within and outside the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and the unwavering commitment of our 5,800 employees, whom we warmly thank for their highly motivated work, we are confident Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances can rise to these challenges.",

These reserves may receive any appropriations decided by the General Meeting, on the proposal of the Board of Directors, in particular with a view to the amortisation or reduction of the capital through the reimbursement or purchase of shares.\n\nThe balance of distributable earnings is attributed to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding in the company as a dividend distribution.\n\nIn addition, the General Meeting may decide to distribute sums deducted from available distributable reserves.\n\nHowever, excluding the case of a capital reduction, no distribution may  be  made  to  shareholders  when  shareholders'  equity  is,  or would become following the distribution, less than the amount of the share capital increased by reserves prohibited from distribution by applicable laws.\n\nThe  conditions  for  dividend  payment  approved  by  the  General Meeting are set by the latter or failing that, by the Board of Directors, and the payment must occur within the time period prescribed by the laws and regulations in force.\n\nThe General Meeting called to approve the accounts for the year may grant to each shareholder, for all or part of the dividend being distributed, or for the interim dividends, a choice between payment of the final or interim dividends in cash or in shares.\n\nIn respect of 2020 to 2022:\n\n- z a  dividend  of  \u20ac7.35  per  share,  amounting  to  a  total  of \u20ac1,095,446,697.45 was distributed in cash to shareholders for 2020;\n- z a dividend of \u20ac9.27 per share, amounting to a total of \u20ac1,381,604,202 was distributed in cash to shareholders for 2021;\n- z on 19 May 2022, the General Meeting decided to distribute a total sum of \u20ac2,000,121,725.14, i.e. \u20ac13.42 per share deducted first from the 'other reserves' item for an amount of \u20ac190,523,633.03 corresponding to all of the distributable reserves, then from the item 'issue premium' for an amount of \u20ac1,809,598,092.11;\n- z a  dividend  of  \u20ac10.73  per  share,  amounting  to  a  total  of \u20ac1,599,203,137.91 was distributed in cash to shareholders for 2022.\n\nIn respect of 2023:\n\n- z the Board of Directors decided on 6 December 2023 to pay an interim cash dividend of \u20ac435,197,871.64 representing \u20ac2.92 per share;\n- z the Board of Directors decided on 6 February 2024 to propose to the General Meeting planned on 30 April 2024, a  dividend of \u20ac6.91 per share, amounting to a total of \u20ac1,029,868,935.97.

This long-term partnership will enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to extend the distribution of its non-life insurance, protection and creditor insurance products to the Banco BPM networks, including via online and mobile banking channels. This transaction is also an opportunity to expand Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' existing partnership with Agos, the leading consumer credit company in Italy, 61% owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group and 39% owned by Banco BPM.\n- This transaction is fully in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' strategic plan for 2025, representing a new major step in its international development. Thanks to this agreement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has become the third-largest non-life bancassurer in Italy,\n- z exposure in banking applications has boosted digital uses and continues to grow with the integration of new functionalities in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's LCL and Ma Banque applications. For example, since 13 November 2023, LCL customers can now sign their Property & Casualty insurance contract, at any time and from anywhere, from their LCL Mes Comptes application, without having to re-authenticate themselves. They are free to insure their home, car or mobile online. In line with the work begun in 2022 on the Ma Banque application, a new crucial step for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  has just been completed, with the integration of the Property & Casualty insurance pathways into the LCL Mes Comptes application,\n- z after a year marked by high inflows in 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, via its subsidiary Predica, continues to support its customers in building their assets and in providing them with the benefit of a financial environment that has once again become favourable to the euro life insurance fund. In line with the net increase of 2022, Predica announced an average PAB (profit sharing) rate of 2.80%, which corresponds to an increase of\n\n50 basis points applied uniformly to all contracts. In addition, in order to promote the diversification of savings, a pillar of a longterm portfolio strategy, and to deal with the erosion of returns net of inflation, Predica is continuing its policy of inflows adapted to each individual, characterised by attractive preferential PAB levels linked to the rate of UA held in their contracts outstanding, allowing a performance of up to 3.85%;\n\n- z on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) pillar:\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances launched a new call for projects: 'Help for caregivers'.

Since 2010, nearly 200  projects have been financially supported throughout France thanks to a budget of more than \u20ac2.5 million.

The latter favour the use of wood and include reuse materials. Equipped with photovoltaic panels and surrounded by green spaces covering approximately 1,000m 2 , these 1,800m 2 structures accommodate around one hundred employees. The buildings meet energy and environmental standards with the BBCA (low-carbon building), E+C- (Positive Energy and Carbon Reduction) labels, as well as the HQE (High Environmental Quality) certification for sustainable buildings 2016, all at the excellent level,\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances launched 'Water in all its states: 48 hours to innovate', a new innovation challenge dedicated to water. During the summer of 2023, 70 departments were affected by water use restrictions. Water is a precious resource but regularly subject to excess or shortages and quality problems, with, for example, the closure of around a hundred drinking water catchments each year due to pollution. As a responsible player, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's societal project, announced the launch of an innovation challenge dedicated to water-related risks, integrating climate and energy transition, inclusion and agricultural and agri-food transitions. This challenge, intended for start-ups, focuses on six issues on which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances wishes to have a direct societal impact: climate risks, water damage, water consumption, water in agriculture, water quality as well as responsible investment and savings,\n- z Pacifica, the property & casualty insurance subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, has chosen to extend, free of charge, until the end of 2023, on simple request, the extension of civil liability and legal protection cover to Ukrainian refugees housed by its multi-risk homeowners. This concerns the main or secondary residences in which refugees benefiting from the temporary protection of the European Union are accommodated. This extension allows them to be protected in the same way as a member of the insured's family;",

Then, enhanced regulatory reporting, which deliver both quantitative and qualitative information, have to be produced in order to attest the quality of the organisation and the financial strength of the company (pillar 3).\n\n## 1.5.1 QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS (PILLAR 1)\n\nFor  several  years,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  adapted  its strategy to match perfectly the Solvency  II directive, whether in terms of activity, investments policy or liabilities structure:\n\n- z orientation of the commercial policy towards Death and Disability , property & casualty insurance and  unit-linked retirement/savings products in order to meet the diversification and profitability targets;\n- z optimisation of assets allocation (investments in more diversified assets and unlisted fixed-income securities and local authority financing,  which  bring  regular  and  little  volatile  returns; development of strategic investments and interest rate hedging policy);\n- z adjustment of financial resources to the eligibility criteria and required level under Solvency II, either via issues (in particular two issues recognised as Tier 1 via the grandfathering clause, in October 2014 and January 2015, initially for \u20ac750 million and \u20ac1 billion, before the partial buyback in October 2023) as well as issues of securities classified Tier 2 in June and September 2016, in January 2018, then in September 2019 and July 2020 for an amount of \u20ac1 billion in each case and via a T2 issue of \u20ac500 million in October 2023.\n\nRegulatory  capita l requirements  are  measured  through  two indicators:\n\n- z the MCR (Minimum Capital Requirement), which is the minimum level of capital, below which the supervisory authority intervenes;\n- z the SCR (Solvency Capital Requirement), which is the target level of capital necessary to absorb the shock induced by a major risk (for instance: an exceptional claim, a shock on assets, etc.).\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group level, the evaluation of the regulatory capital required is calculated by using the standard formula of the Solvency II directive (formula and assumptions proposed by the  European  Insurance  and  Occupational  Pensions  Authority), which is adapted to the risk profile of the Group. No transitional measure was used by the Group, except for grandfathering clause on subordinated debts. The standard formula covers all risks (market risks,  life  underwriting  risks,  non-life  underwriting  risks,  health underwriting risks, default risks, operational risks), with market and life underwriting risks representing the major part of the capital required, reflecting the predominance of savings and retirement activities in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the MCR coverage ratio of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances amounted to 418%.\n\nAt 31 December  2023, the SCR coverage ratio of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances amounted to 215%.",

It ensures that non-compliance risks are properly managed, in particular through the deployment and execution of controls and reporting. It steers, as necessary, projects for the development and adaptation of Group-level compliance systems. It also issues opinions to inform decision-making by the business lines and managers;\n\n- z the Internal Audit function, which provides a professional and independent opinion to the AMSB (Administrative Management or Supervisory Body) on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system and other governance system elements, on the compliance of the activities with the strategy et the defined risk appetence, the written policies, activities' conduct and monitoring devices, leads audit missions on the spot checks into the existence (activities control, audit plan implementation, setting corrective measures and implementation of their follow-up).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group carries out estimates of its risks and solvency in the framework of the ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment) and has submitted a report to the supervisory authority every year since 2015. This report estimates the overall solvency need, taking into account the specific risk profile, the approved limits of risk tolerance and business strategies. It enables verification that the assessment of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR), based on the standard Solvency II formula, reflects the risk profile of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  and to ensure the continuous compliance, in the short or longer term, with solvency requirements.\n\n## INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (PILLAR 3)\n\nThe  Solvency  II  directive  provides  for  the  realisation  of  annual quantitative statements, the QRT (Quantitative Reporting Templates). They are dashboards, the data of which were stated by the EIOPA, and which cover the main business lines of an insurer: assets  management,  technical  reserves,  equity,  balance  sheet, reinsurance program, changes analysis.\n\nNarrative reports are also required, with the purpose of describing the company's activity, its system of governance, its risk profile. They are complementary to the annual quantitative statements, providing\n\namongst others information on valuation methods used as well as precisions on capital management. There are two narrative reports:\n\n- z the SFCR (Solvency and Financial Conditions Report), aimed at the public;\n- z the RSR (Regular Supervisory Report), aimed at the supervisory authority.\n\nIn accordance with the Solvency II directive, all European entities and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group communicate the required RSR and QRT to the regulators concerned at the frequency requested by each regulator. The SFCR and QRT for the public are published annually and are available at ca-assurances.com.\n\n1 1",

        "page_content": "## 2.1 INTRODUCTION: SETTING  SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY AT THE HEART OF CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES' BUSINESS LINES\n\nAs of 2018, the annual CSR report required by the 2012 Grenelle II law has been replaced by a Non-Financial Performance Statement (NFPS) governed by the Ordinance of 19 July 2017 and its implementation decrees. The law does not require Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to produce an NFPS. It contributes to the consolidated NFPS produced by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A., which is published in its annual Universal Registration Document. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances therefore takes a voluntary approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting.\n\n## 2.1.1 ANALYSING CSR TOPICS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's societal project published in December 2021 is structured around three themes:\n\n- z acting for the climate and the transition to a low carbon economy;\n- z strengthening social cohesion and inclusion;\n- z supporting the agricultural and agri-food transitions.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  makes  it  a  priority  to  integrate  these societal challenges into all its business lines and to ensure the impact of its actions on each of the three themes makes a difference on a local level , where its customers live and work.\n\nBy identifying its main CSR challenges, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has built a structured CSR policy based on three main thrusts, within which the themes of the Group's societal project sit.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' societal actions in each main axis of its CSR policy are detailed below.\n\nAligned with the raison d'\u00eatre (1) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group, since 2010, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has deployed a corporate social responsibility approach in all its business lines and activities. CSR is a strategic issue, as confirmed in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s 'Ambitions 2025' strategic plan, presented in 2022.\n\n## Axis No. 1: Acting as a responsible insurer\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' overriding responsibility is to protect its customers by providing products, advice and a quality service tailored  to  their  needs  and  expectations.  When  developing  its products, it systematically considers the preventive angle. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also strives to embed social and environmental issues throughout the entire value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Warn customers about upcoming weather  events and inform them of the preventive action  to take to limit their impacts ( e.g.  weather  warnings and personalised prevention advice)   |                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enable everyone access  to insurance  via offers tailored to each individual's needs and  capacities                                                                                   |                                                                                                   |\n| Allow customers to save  in a responsible  manner by increasing outstandings of                                                                                                        | Allow customers to save  in a responsible  manner by increasing outstandings of                   |\n| Uphold the  sustainability of farms  and  agricultural businesses as they deal with                                                                                                    | Uphold the  sustainability of farms  and  agricultural businesses as they deal with               |\n| climate change                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                   |\n| Continue support to  French forests  (One of the  leaders in French forest insurance, partnership                                                                                      | Continue support to  French forests  (One of the  leaders in French forest insurance, partnership |\n| with Plantons pour l'Avenir, actions implemented  with Reforest'Action, tree planting and                                                                                              | with Plantons pour l'Avenir, actions implemented  with Reforest'Action, tree planting and         |\n| protection backed by a wide range of savings  and protection products)                                                                                                                 | protection backed by a wide range of savings  and protection products)                            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 2",

In use since 2012, FReD is based on three pillars relating to trust and customer relations (Fides), respect for employees and the company's  ecosystem  (RESPECT)  and  environmental  protection (DEMETER). Each year, a FReD action plan is drawn up by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and validated by the Executive Committee. An index is used to measure progress in the plan.\n\n## Axis No. 3: Acting as a responsible company\n\nIn its operations, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances strives to take into account the social and environmental impacts of all aspects of its work, as much in its purchasing processes as in managing resources and waste, for example. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also places a strong focus on employee development, which involves improving the Quality of Life at Work (Q.L.W.) , guaranteeing fair treatment and promoting diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Measure and reduce Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances'  direct carbon footprint                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increase employee awareness  of societal  challenges and implement eco-action program s  for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances employees |\n| Nurture employee commitment                                                                                                       |\n| Continue the commitment to supporting carers                                                                                      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis performance evaluation using the FReD index forms one of the criteria for incentive plans which affect the variable compensation of employees at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions and directors of UES Pacifica.

Under the aegis of\n\n## 2.2.2 ACTING ETHICALLY\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities strive to take an ethical approach to their customers and partners, in particular by making sure that they comply with their commitments.\n\nWithin  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances,  new  products  and  services are  analysed  by  internal  Committees  (called  'New  Products and  New  Business'  (NAP)  Committees).  These  Committees  are specific to each French and international entity, and are made up of  representatives  of  the  Risk,  Legal,  Actuarial,  Marketing  and Compliance functions, among others. In particular, these validating bodies ensure that the products offered to clients meet real client needs and conform to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances' CSR  policy. These bodies ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements: clarity  of  information  provided  to  clients,  definition  of  a  target\n\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, NZIA brings together insurers and reinsurers from around the world.\n\nmarket, tackling money laundering and the financing of terrorism, prevention of fraud and corruption, compliance with the Code of Conduct and internal procedures, etc.\n\nFor  several  years  now,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  been developing actions to strengthen its responsibility towards its clients:\n\n- z customers and partner networks are regularly involved in designing new products in co-creation workshops, during which their needs are assessed in depth and their reactions to new proposals are analysed;\n- z customers are also involved in the product life cycle via their representatives on the governing bodies of non-profits that have taken out life insurance contracts: in particular, these bodies must approve any changes made to the contracts.\n\n## 2.2.3 BUILDING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS\n\n## Ensuring that products are clear and understandable\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has developed a product offering suited to all types of customers (individuals, small businesses, farmers and corporations) in response to the different insurance needs of its customers.\n\nThe legibility and clarity of the guarantees and contracts constitute an ethical commitment and a guarantee of customer loyalty.\n\nAdvertising material and contracts are carefully scrutinised, with an emphasis on the objectivity and transparency of the documents; for example, risks as well as benefits must be prominently displayed.\n\nThanks  to  the  partner  banks  operating  locally,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances provides all its corporate customers, regardless of the segment, with a summary view of claims experience and indicates the  appropriate  measures  taken  to  guarantee  the  technical equilibrium of the contract.\n\n## Supporting the distribution networks in providing  high quality customer advice\n\nThe distribution networks are trained to identify customer needs using their customer discovery tools. Customers' insurance needs and knowledge of financial mechanisms are assessed. The networks also receive regular training, especially in the case of new product launches or product changes. For each new product, Predica and Pacifica develop and distribute a training program (branch manager background, advisor background, e-learning, micro-learning, etc.) for the distribution networks of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Regional Banks and LCL. These materials are intended to provide distributors with an understanding and explanation of the characteristics of new products in order to be able to market them appropriately. In addition, as part of the marketing of its collective insurance offering, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has provided more than 30 hours of training to technical sales teams from partner banks to train and inform them on changes to regulations, the offering, and management tools and processes. Advisor training is a key marker used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group in ensuring the excellence of its relationships. It is now reinforced by the Insurance Distribution Directive, which requires advisors to undergo 15 hours of training each year.\n\n1 2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFor  personal  protection  and  property  &  casualty  products,  an 'e-Wheel' tool shared with the customer enables an approach based on exchange, listening, awareness and satisfaction. It helps discover customers'  needs  so  that  they  can  be  offered  the  appropriate protection. Accessible from the adviser's workstation and as a tablet application, the 'e-Wheel' helps advisers to present and explain all  personal  and  property  protection  options  to  customers  in  a completely transparent way. A summary of the products selected by the customer is sent by email and archived at the end of each interview.\n\nCACI,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  personal  risk  and  creditor protection insurance subsidiary, has developed an online sign-up tool. It allows medical information to be selected and the online signature  of  Creditor  Protection  Insurance  contracts.  Its  more systematic use is now being introduced in the LCL network to make the '100% digital' sign-up process easier and shorter.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  took  the  decision  to  accelerate  its digital trajectory so that advisors could maintain their long-term relationships with customers. To this end, depending on the wishes of each individual customer, advisors can provide support either face-to-face or based on a telephone conversation with documents submitted to the customer's secure online account. Customers can finalise contracts themselves and sign them via a fully online process.\n\nIn June 2021, a new personal risks insurance named Mon Assurance D\u00e9c\u00e8s was launched. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' advisory approach was reinforced for this launch through the use of a simulation tool that guides customers and advisors in choosing the level of death benefits to be covered. The simulator provides a bespoke, adjustable level of benefits tailored to the protection required by the customer and their family situation.\n\n## Optimising service quality\n\n## Claims administration\n\nFor  an  insurer,  handling  claims  (fire,  theft,  water  damage, hail  damage,  road  accidents,  etc.)  is  a  major  issue  in  terms  of responsibility. Pacifica therefore offers an active, fast service, along with quality customer support.\n\n## COMMITMENT TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nThe preservation of the environment and natural resources is at the heart of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' concerns. As a result, in claims management, repair is preferred as an alternative to replacement:\n\n- z household appliance repair:\n\nFor nearly 20 years, Pacifica has been leading and developing its partnership with Darty in the field of household appliance repair, replacement and recycling.\n\nSince 1 January 2023, a new 'Supporter' partner has been added to the system. Supporter carries out diagnostics and repairs to the\n\nproducts of policyholders affected via the home insurance contract, thanks to 611 technicians throughout the country to intervene as locally as possible to policyholders.\n\nAt the end of the repair, 70% of customers opt for one of the two proposed partners.\n\nThese partnerships also improve response times and prevent customers from paying upfront costs:\n\n- z car windscreen repair:\n\nThe repair rates vary between 10% and 30% at the main partners. This approach, which is virtuous from an environmental standpoint, also contributes to the control of claims costs;\n\n- z the use of re used parts in cars:\n- Since 2017, ASSERCAR, Pacifica's approved body shop network, has been promoting the use of reuse parts among 2,000 partner repairers through the management of their activity.\n- To provide simplified access to second-hand parts, ASSERCAR has developed, in partnership with OPISTO, the used car part specialist, its online sales portal: ASSERCAR PRE;\n- z refurbished devices to replace mobile devices:\n- For ' Tous Mobiles device insurance' claims management, Pacifica favours repair and replacement by a refurbished device. (See Tous Mobiles device insurance).\n\n## CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATION INDEX FOLLOWING A CLAIM (1)\n\n|          | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Pacifica | 44 points | 42 points | 46 points |\n\nIndex based on surveying 4,522 individual Pacifica customers making a property & casualty claim between 1 October 2022 and 30 September 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Pacifica's customer recommendation index increased by 4  points to 46  points. As in the two preceding years, this was a positive value, indicating that there are significantly more promoting than detracting clients.\n\nThe claims management units (CMUs) and partner networks involved in this service process, work closely with clients making claims to find a solution suited to each situation.\n\n## ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE HEARING AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED\n\nIn 2018, Pacifica set up a specific partnership to make its telephone service for claims reporting and assistance accessible to people with impaired hearing, sight, speech or aphasia.\n\n## PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR CLAIMANTS\n\nEach year, Pacifica manages more than a million claims ranging from a simple broken window to major events coups durs - such as house or business fires or serious personal injury. For customers, those events can be significant and traumatic, requiring a response which goes beyond the issue of financial compensation.\n\n- (1) The CRI can range from -100 to +100. Its value is based on the answer to the question, 'Following this claim, would you recommend Pacifica to your family, friends or colleagues?' The result represents the difference between the share of promoting clients and the share of detracting clients. A positive value indicates that there are more promoting than detracting clients and vice versa.  Of the clients surveyed in 2022:\n- \u00b7 55% were promoters (gave a rating of 9 or 10);\n- \u00b7 13% were detractors (ratings of 0 to 6);\n- \u00b7 32% were neutral (rating of 7 or 8) and therefore not included in the index calculation.\n- For Pacifica this year, the value is therefore +42 (55-13).",

        "page_content": "With  this  in  mind,  psychological  and  tailored  support  can  be provided in order to help clients in their daily lives and life projects. Faced with this issue, Pacifica has set up a psychological support service  for  the  post-disaster  period  such  as  attacks,  accidents, weather events, etc. This service consists of connecting customers and/or their relatives with psychologists from Work Place Options, a partner of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, to help them find emotional balance. In the customer satisfaction survey carried out in 2023, 83% of customers said they would recommend the service. This remained high, but was down compared to 2022, when 90% of customers said they would recommend the service.\n\n## SUPPORT IN REBUILDING LIVES\n\nSince  2019,  Pacifica  has  been  offering  individual  support  to  its customers who have suffered personal injury to help them rebuild their  lives  and  overcome  their  disabilities.  These  services  are externally run by Kar\u00e9o Horizon and Equiphoria.\n\nKar\u00e9o Horizon, which focuses on helping the affected person regain autonomy, operates a comprehensive Case Management system of personalised, all-round support to assist them in creating a new life plan adapted to their disability.\n\nEquiphoria is a hippotherapy centre which uses horses to treat the  whole  person,  taking  into  account  both  their  physical  and psychological needs. Victims attend personalised residential therapy courses during which they work with a horse to rebuild their confidence and in doing so reinforce their functional and cognitive abilities.\n\n## COLLECTIVE INSURANCE\n\nIn 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances introduced an analytical approach to personal risk insurance. Since 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has used an absenteeism analysis tool allowing the development of a collective action plan. The employer company receives a report and, depending on absenteeism levels, solutions may be proposed to help get employees back to work. These can take the form of interviews between the employee and a social advisor to provide support in return to work or a move to a new position (career review, job-seeking tools and techniques, identification and follow-up on job interviews). This approach was cemented in 2021 with the creation of a digital dashboard laying out the information so that employers can check it at any time.\n\n## Complaints handling\n\nComplaints are used alongside surveys to measure how satisfied customers are with their experiences. Their satisfaction is key to achieving excellence in relationships. Dissatisfied customers expect a prompt response with clear and transparent information. They want their questions to be answered and corrective action taken where necessary.\n\nThe  procedure  for  handling  customer  complaints  is  regularly updated so that each business line can improve the existing system, particularly in terms of customer information about the avenues for making a complaint, handling times for complaints and the existence of a mediation charter.\n\nIn  France,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   and  LCL  banking  networks  are  the main contacts for handling complaints about insurance contracts.\n\nDissatisfied customers may also contact the insurance companies involved or the Insurance Mediator.\n\nPredica has a set of procedures that include a periodic review of the main reasons for complaints. This may lead to improving the information provided to customers or amending procedures to make them clearer and more explicit. Information from this periodical analysis is included in a Voix du Client (customer voice) process intended to steer the resolution of all customer grievances identified. The key performance indicators for the complaints process and major complaints are also reported annually to the Management Committee.\n\nPacifica has developed key indicators to analyse complaints, thus promoting better knowledge of customer expectations, expressed through  dissatisfaction.  This  information  is  reported  back  to Pacifica's Management Committee on a regular basis and informs changes to certain policies, to improve the understanding of the cover provided for their policyholders and provide better support in the event of a claim.\n\nThe  main  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  companies  have  made  a commitment to honour the time frames for processing customer complaints. Pacifica is committed to a maximum processing time of 60 days, with nearly 90% of claims handled within 30 days (in 57% of cases a reply is provided in under 10 days of receipt).\n\n## Home care services\n\nThe personal services sector has seen growth in recent years due to a number of social changes such as favourable public policies (tax credits, assistance with long-term care), an ageing population, increased economic activity amongst women and changing family structures. Personal services play a key role in employment in France, accounting for 7% of the country's market employment. They are used by more than 15% of French people. All social categories use them and spend nearly 10% of their budget on them, regardless of their standard of living.\n\nAt the same time, companies in the sector are facing a shortage of employees and difficulties in recruitment, something they are seeking to reduce by offering more attractive pay and employment terms.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  partner,  Europ  Assistance,  offers  a national platform specialising in home care services. All of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's clients can use it to set up and manage their services.  Europ  Assistance  has  a  network  of  home  care  service providers following a very demanding quality charter, which makes it possible to select the best service providers according to essential criteria: quality of the customer relationship and the services offered, professionalism  and  training  of  stakeholders,  compliance  with the conditions of the assignment and the customer's private life, approval and required authorisations, etc. Thanks to its information system, Europ Assistance is able to manage the quality of service delivered by service providers on a daily basis based on scalable scoring.\n\nUnder  this  partnership  with  Europ  Assistance,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances can offer its policyholders a distinctive, high-quality service that facilitates their daily lives.\n\n1 2",

If these initial efforts are not conclusive, the teams responsible for finding the beneficiaries will then call on a network of specialised service providers, including genealogy firms and private detectives.\n\nLastly,  awareness-raising  measures  are  taken  with  customers, particularly  when  the  contract  is  taken  out  and  when  key  life events occur. The purpose of these checks is to make sure that the beneficiary clause is still appropriate for the family situation and in accordance with the policyholder's wishes.\n\n## Customer satisfaction\n\nCredit Agricole Assurances seeks to build a long-term relationship with customers in all its products. This recognition of the consistency of measures put in place at all levels of the value chain is reflected in the customer satisfaction rate.\n\n| Customer satisfaction rate   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Pacifica (1)                 | 93%    | 92%    | 93%    |\n| Predica (2)                  | 90%    | 90%    | 90.5%  |\n| Europ Assistance (3)         | 97%    | 91%    | 85%    |\n\n- (1) Index based on a survey of 4,522 individual Pacifica customers following a motor or domestic incident.\n- (2) Final result at the end of 2023.

In  2023,  Previseo Obs\u00e8ques organised the Responsible and Solidarity Funeral Awards in support of Social and Solidarity Economy structures and nonprofits providing support to the bereaved.\n\n## For example:\n\n- z non-profits providing a decent burial for people who have died living on the street or in isolation;\n- z the INP foundation of Grenoble, through its \u00c9tu'deuil platform, which helps students who have lost a parent during their studies;\n- z 'Les Petites Veuvries' which creates links between young widows, i.e. under 55 years old.\n\nOn  this  occasion,  in  2023,  each  winning  structure  received  an endowment ranging from \u20ac3,000 to \u20ac5,000 for a total of \u20ac42,000.\n\n## Guaranteeing personal data protection\n\nCredit Agricole Assurances has implemented the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on 25 th May 2018 .\n\nAs well as governing the collection of information without which our insurance business could not operate successfully, this regulation requires  all  personal  data  processing  to  be  described  in  detail, conducted securely and carried out by accredited staff who are regularly trained in the GDPR rules and the obligations arising from them.\n\nUnder the 'Privacy by Design' approach, privacy considerations for the personal data of customers, staff and subcontractors are integrated into all new processes and new products from the design stage.\n\nIn order to respect retention periods, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has introduced a data deletion project to destroy any data for which the legal retention period has expired.\n\n## 2.2.4 STRENGTHENING THE RESPONSIBLE DIMENSION OF OUR INSURANCE OFFERS AND SERVICES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' product offering aims at responding to the main human and environmental societal challenges. Insurance allows policyholders to directly manage new risks.\n\nTo help all business lines incorporate societal concerns into their offering, an approach and tool ('CSR reference framework') have been  created  and  trialled  since  2020.  This  approach,  involving internal  and  external  stakeholders,  continues  to  be  rolled  out across all business lines to integrate CSR criteria into the process of designing and redesigning 100% of new offers by 2025.\n\n## Reducing social vulnerabilities: ageing population, disability, increasing precarity of  customer segments, isolation\n\n## Ageing and ageing well\n\n## FINANCIAL PREPARATION FOR RETIREMENT\n\nThe issue of pensions and retirement is a major social concern in France, and a major pillar of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' targets for 2025. The goal is to reach \u20ac24 billion in retirement products by 2025. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Retraite was created to support this project.  This  Supplementary  Occupational  Pension  fund accommodates  individual  and  collective  pension  contracts  and provides the best support to policyholders in preparing for their retirement.",

        "page_content": "## LONG-TERM CARE\n\n'Ageing well' is a social issue with a double challenge: the wellbeing of seniors, and support for those experiencing a gradual loss of autonomy.\n\nKey figures:\n\n- z 39% of the population will be over 55 by 2050;\n- z 85% of French people want to age at home;\n- z in 2021, there were approximately 9.3 million caregivers in France. \u00bc of working people could be in a family caregiver situation by 2030;\n- z expenditure on long-term care for older people is likely to reach 2.78 points of GDP by 2060.\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE INNOVATES FOR AGEING WELL\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances thus seeks to provide solutions to seniors who need them. Thus, the customers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Regional Banks benefit from a product offering, targeted via a dedicated digital system set up in collaboration with other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group  entities  and  external  partners,  which  integrates  product offerings from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities.\n\nAt present, using a tablet app, bank advisors are able to conduct an interview to identify senior customers' life projects and needs on essential themes such as social links, daily life, the comfort and security of housing. Once the interview is completed, the application provides the customer with a range of advice and preventative messages, as well as Group solutions that can meet their needs (home services and support, home improvements, remote support and monitoring, insurance, etc.). The customers who have tried this new system have been very satisfied, as it allows them to understand their situation and to discover the solutions available to support them in their life projects. Bank advisors are also particularly positive about this process, which has allowed them to re-establish a link with their senior customers and better understand their needs.\n\nThis system is set to evolve in the medium term, in order to allow seniors  access  to  an  offer  dedicated  to  their  needs  in  a  fully independent manner from their bank advisor. Initially, the solution will  be  based  on  an  immediate  response via an  expert  in  the medico-social sector which will then be gradually enhanced with digital services. With these solutions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group wants to establish itself as a key player in ageing well. This initiative to promote 'ageing well at home' is part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's Societal Project and contributes to the new strategic direction of the 'Health and Territories' business line defined in the 'Ambitions 2025' medium-term plan.\n\n## EXAMPLE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY PREDICA TO PROMOTE AGEING WELL\n\nPredica has an offering which can provide financial support in the event of a loss of autonomy. Carrying the France Assureurs label, this offering provides a minimum monthly payment of between \u20ac500 and \u20ac3,000 in the event of significant long-term care needs. In particular this allows the funding of personal services to help people stay in their own homes, or the coverage of a share of care home costs. This offering also responds to the needs of families facing a close relative's loss of autonomy, by providing a panel of services, for example the funding of a respite leave. If an insured carer needs a break and wants to be temporarily replaced in looking\n\nafter their relative, Predica will offer to organise and fund up to \u20ac1,000 inc. taxes of a range of services. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' healthcare partners are committed to provide  a response within 72 hours and a solution within 30 days, for policyholders looking for a care home. Their carers of the insured can also benefit from athome training in essential carer skills provided by a nurse. Although the subject of dependency remains a major concern for the French and despite several initiatives by certain members of Parliament and France Assureurs in terms of cover and financing of dependency, no legislative scenario is emerging in the short term, which would make it possible to better position this offer. As a result, by end-2023, 148,669 customers were covered by Predica for risk of dependence.\n\n## INDIVIDUAL HEALTH\n\nIn order to respond to the challenges of public health, Pacifica's health offerings for individuals are based on solidarity and responsibility.\n\nTherefore,  no  medical  selection  takes  place,  the  coordinated healthcare circuit is followed, minimum reimbursements (such as patient contributions to consultations, pharmacy fees and hospital costs)  are  applied  and  preventive  procedures  are  covered.  To support the increase in life expectancy, Pacifica raised the age limit for taking out its contracts  in June 2023 and has adapted its cover to better meet the needs of its senior policyholders (for example, housework hours if the person is unable to move, and prevention actions such as flu vaccinations).\n\nIn  addition,  health  products  and  services  have  included  ' 100% Sant\u00e9 ' since 1 st January 2020  in order to support the 'nothing to pay'  principle  for  customers  and  thereby  reduce  incidences  of renouncement to healthcare for the most vulnerable. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  increased  the  coverage  rate  of  its hospital cover in December 2022, in view of the economic and inflationary context.\n\nIn addition, in response to the emergence of psychological problems amongst  the French population, related in particular to the health crisis, Pacifica covers psychological consultations. Henceforth, for psychology  consultations,  after  payment  under  the  mandatory health regime, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will pay the remaining cost to the policyholder regardless of the policy held.\n\n## PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE\n\nIn  addition  to  the  'Personal  Accident  Insurance'  subscription condition, which is reserved for people under the age of 75, Pacifica wished to pay particular attention to the oldest policyholders who already trust Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances . Since 2018, the extension of cover to grandchildren (if they are under the age of 18) is granted to our oldest policyholders, even over the age of 75, when they have custody and in the absence of parents. In 2019, the extension of cover was expanded to nephews and nieces of the insured under the age of 17, in the event of temporary care. Childcare is costly and people are increasingly turning to family members for their childcare needs, particularly when returning to a low-paid or insecure job. It was therefore essential to find a 'full' protection solution covering the children when in the care of other close family members. Pacifica has also strengthened it insurance cover with ' Coup Dur 50/50' for seniors, which pays out \u20ac50 a day for people over the age of 50 if they are hospitalised for more than 48 hours within a limit of 60 days per insured event.\n\n1 2",

Since 2015, this organisation has transformed this diagnosis into proposed actions to give new life to a generational contract based around a core belief: all economic policy measures must be designed and implemented through an intergenerational prism. In addition, work is underway with the TDTE Chair on the modelling of dependency risks in the Territories.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  company  is  continuing  to  invest  in  the development and management of senior care homes.\n\nThus, at the end of 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances committed to guaranteeing the Clariane capital increase, which should take place in 2024, for an amount of \u20ac200 million. At the end of 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also entered into two real estate partnerships with Clariane.\n\n## Inclusion of vulnerable populations\n\n## ASSISTANCE TO POPULATIONS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY\n\nPacifica, a subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, covers in civil liability and defence-recourse any person who usually lives under the same roof as a multi-risk home insurance policyholder.\n\nSince 2022, Pacifica has extended these guarantees, free of charge and without prior declaration, to all Ukrainian refugees hosted by its multi-risk housing policyholders, regardless of their date of arrival and the duration of their stay.\n\nThis concerns the main or secondary residences in which Ukrainian refugees benefiting from the temporary protection of the European Union are temporarily housed. This extension allows them to be protected in the same way as a member of the insured's family.\n\nIndeed, Pacifica has extended its Civil Liability and defence-recourse cover to Ukrainian refugees hosted by policyholders with multi-risk housing cover.\n\n## SOLIDARITY-BASED CONTRACT\n\nMany savers wish to invest in solidarity investments, while remaining attentive to the returns offered, in order to allow the financing of activities chosen according to their social utility. Predica launched a 'solidarity-based contract' in 2013, the first multi-fund ethical life insurance contract to obtain the Finansol label. It is an innovative policy that combines savings and social benefits, with:\n\n- z an ethical euro investment fund specially created for this contract, including investments of 5% to 10% in social enterprises ( via Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's asset manager). The remainder is managed in the same way as Predica's general assets, which includes an ESG filter;\n- z a range of eight Greenfin or Finansol-certified unit-linked products.\n\nSince the introduction of the Pacte law in 2019, all life insurance contracts have been enhanced with SRI, Greenfin and Finansolcertified funds.\n\nThe majority of the contracts offered by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances benefit  from  quarterly  additions  of  vehicles,  and  in  particular labelled vehicles, in line with the objective of having certified UA outstandings of \u20ac28 billion by 2025, making it possible to regularly enrich the universe with labelled vehicles.\n\nThe benefits and advantages of the solidarity contract are now widely distributed through a variety of possible investments.\n\nAs a result, the Solidarity Contract was closed to sales in 2023.\n\n## PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPL\u00c9MENTAIRE SANT\u00c9 SOLIDAIRE SCHEME (FREE TOP-UP HEALTH INSURANCE)\n\nOn  1 st November  2019,  the  ACS  (1)  and  CMU-C  (2)  merged  to become Compl\u00e9mentaire Sant\u00e9 Solidaire in order to improve access to healthcare for people who were eligible for the ACS ( Aide \u00e0 la Compl\u00e9mentaire  Sant\u00e9 ).  This  new  scheme  offers  a  unique  and regulated level of cover. Customers are still selected based on their financial resources. Pacifica has decided to continue taking part in the scheme and has therefore modulated its product offering and updated its processes.\n\n## 'POINTS PASSERELLE'\n\nThe Points Passerelle (Gateway Points) welcome Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group customers who encounter financial difficulties as a result of a life hazard such as job loss, separation, death, illness, etc. They are supported at no additional cost by dedicated advisors to help them  regain  autonomy  and  financial  stability.  These  customers should not have to give up their mobility or have to drive without insurance due to financial difficulties. On the contrary, a car is often essential when looking for a job. Pacifica have therefore introduced a scheme to reimburse six months of car insurance premiums for these customers, both those already insured and new subscribers. Since  December  2021,  the  scheme  also  removes  the  deductible in the event of a claim. It has also been expanded to cover twowheel vehicles. The financial cost is shared between Pacifica and the Regional Banks offering the scheme.\n\n## SOLIDARITY-BASED FUND\n\nSince 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' collective insurance business unit has taken several social action initiatives for a few targeted large  accounts  by  setting  up  a  special  assistance  fund  (fed  by various mechanisms) intended to meet the exceptional healthcare needs of employees for care not covered by the collective insurance contract. This approach continued to be implemented in 2020, and the solidarity fund was deployed for all insured in all healthcare collective contracts in January 2021. Access to a solidarity fund (subject to eligibility) makes it possible to provide financial support to employees in order to respond to vulnerable situations.\n\n## PROMOTING INSURANCE FOR ALL\n\nIn the same spirit, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances seeks to give everyone access to insurance, notably through its entry-level offering.\n\nAs a universal bancassurer, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has included an inclusive insurance solution in its new motor insurance range, with no reduction in essential cover, as everyone deserves to be properly protected against life's risks. Eko (Primo for LCL) is available to all clients and includes:\n\n- z driver injury protection, up to \u20ac2 million with no minimum amount, with cover included for all vehicles (insured, borrowed, hired, bicycles, etc.);\n- z civil liability;\n- z legal protection;\n- z roadside assistance, with an excess of 25 km in the event of a breakdown;\n- z access to an advisor and to the full range of online services;\n- z attractive prices.",

        "page_content": "Since the launch of the offer, 97,790 contracts have been covered by the EKO auto insurance formula, including more than 48,000 subscribed in 2023.\n\nThe multi-risk home offer for young tenants, intended for young people between the ages of 18 and 30, offered at a low price with essential guarantees has also been successful since its launch in December 2022. At the end of December 2023, nearly 91,000  new contracts  had been subscribed using this formula.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances hopes that by 2025, 200,000 customers will be covered by entry-level motor and home insurance contracts\n\n## Support for non-profits promoting inclusion\n\nIn 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Regional Banks mobilised for the '1  well protected customer  = \u20ac5 donated' campaign. For four months, subject to conditions, for each death benefit contract signed, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances undertook to donate \u20ac5 to local non-profits organizations.\n\nAs  a  result,  nearly  \u20ac276,000  were  collected  and  donated  to 38 Organisations  selected by the Regional Banks for their action in favour of cohesion and social inclusion.\n\n## Integrating climate change mitigation issues into offers\n\nThe frequency and scale of climate events (particularly heatwaves, drought, hail, floods, storms and periods of extreme cold) keeps increasing. According to experts and the latest IPCC reports, these changes are due to increased greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity. The cost of natural disasters is increasing and in the years to come will be exponential if people do not change their behaviour. Insurance can help limit these greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging policyholders to behave in a more environmentalfriendly way. Pacifica also supports its policyholders by alerting them by means of text messages of imminent risk situations (storms, risk of flooding, hail, etc.).\n\n## Comprehensive home insurance\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  introduced  insurance  cover  for renewable energy facilities (solar panels, wind turbines) as part of its comprehensive home insurance and all-risks business and farming insurance contracts. These offerings provide, at no extra cost, civil liability cover for energy producers in the event of damage to a third party.\n\nThe 25% premium reduction on the first year of home insurance initially offered to people taking out an eco-PTZ loan (interest-free loan to finance work to improve a building's energy efficiency) was then extended to the Energy Economy Loan. More flexible than an eco-PTZ loan, this loan finances work designed to save energy.\n\n## Car insurance\n\nPacifica promotes the use of electric vehicles by offering the Bonus Transition Mobilit\u00e9 : a \u20ac100 refund in the first year for every policy taken out to cover an electric vehicle. This bonus can also be added as an additional clause when switching to an electric vehicle.\n\nPacifica is also adapting to new uses and covers insurance needs for carpooling (driver injury, protection of passengers, including when they take the wheel, and assistance). For policyholders travelling less than 7,000 kilometres a year, Pacifica applies a premium reduction of 10%.\n\nSince 2018, Pacifica has extended its two-wheel vehicle insurance to cover new types of electric vehicles, thus meeting insurance needs and supporting new urban mobility solutions.\n\nIn addition, since 2021, the bodily protection of drivers, which is provided to auto policyholders, has been extended to all the vehicles they drive, and in particular bicycles.\n\nLastly,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  committed  to  reducing uninsured motor incidents.\n\n## 'Tous Mobiles' device insurance\n\nPacifica launched its 'Tous Mobiles' device insurance in 2018 to cover all portable electronic devices in a household against theft, accidental damage, fraudulent use of mobile phones and the theft of accessories. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to prioritising repair or reconditioning where possible within its electronic device insurance activity.\n\n## Charity donations\n\nFrom 1 st April until 30 June 2023, for each payment into an eligible life insurance contract by a customer, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances donated  \u20ac10  to  local  charities  selected  by  the  Regional  Banks. Through the 32 Regional Banks involved in the initiative, \u20ac555,000 were donated to 81 organizations  working to tackle societal and environmental issues.\n\nThis  activity  promotes  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole's  solidarity  commitment and local roots. This has been in place since 2021 to support clients who want to give meaning to their investment, and continue their commitment to societal and environmental issues, in line with the societal project.\n\n## Responsible Investment\n\nPredica offers labelled unit-linked funds (SRI, Greenfin or Finansol) in the multi-fund life insurance contracts distributed by its networks. They include thematic approaches and best-in-class approaches, which consist - in the selection of companies - in favouring the bestrated companies from an ESG standpoint in their sectors of activity, without favouring or excluding a specific sector compared to the stock market index used as a starting point.\n\nSince  2020,  rolling  out  this  responsible  investment  approach has formed part of an overall approach towards the networks in cooperation with Premundi and Amundi (events, sales techniques, pitch, etc.). In July 2021, an 'engaged and responsible' range of life insurance contracts was launched through the Regional Banks network, accompanied by specific marketing material. With this range, customers can choose to invest in products that are working to tackle today's major economic, social and environmental challenges. A process has also been put in place to expand customer access to responsible investment mandates. Examples include the LCL Better World mandate offered in certain LCL contracts since October 2022, and the Strat\u00e9gie mandate (responsible management) available in some of the contracts offered to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group customers.\n\n1 2",

As a result, life insurance contract guides provide more information for products classified as 'Article 8' and 'Article 9', and for certified products. Sustainability information for the euro product is now provided in a specific contractual document.\n\n## Supporting the French forest\n\n## Reforestation campaign\n\nForests are the world's largest terrestrial carbon sink and an essential element in biodiversity. Action to protect forests is essential to help limit the effects of climate change both locally and globally. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has therefore announced its desire to increase carbon capture and commit to biodiversity through reforestation and  sustainable  forestry  in  France.  In  2019,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances launched a project in partnership with Reforest'Action and with the backing of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group Regional Banks, pledging to plant or protect a tree for every eligible Predica life or personal risk insurance contract taken out. Since 1 January 2022, the operation has been extended to new life insurance contracts, thus strengthening its impact on the forest and the environment. Customers are provided with full information about the topic and they are involved in the approach, as they are invited to choose from several different projects when taking out their contract.\n\nIn 2023, the operation linking eligible life or personal risk contracts with planting or protecting a tree resulted in 588,508 trees planted or protected in France. Since 2019, more than 2.1 million trees have been planted or protected, providing more than 6.3  million shelters for animals and creating more than 300,000 days of work that cannot be moved abroad.\n\n## Promoting the sustainability of French forests\n\nForest  areas  are  increasingly  being  promoted  to  conserve biodiversity, in their role of carbon sequestration, in the water cycle, and for their economic importance.\n\nForest insurance is one way to protect this heritage. Following a storm or fire, an insured forest will be regenerated more quickly than an uninsured forest thanks to cover for reforestation costs and financial losses. These guarantees are included in the forest insurance contracts and make it possible to ensure the regeneration of forests following a covered loss, in addition to the tax benefit granted to forest owners. Indeed, the forest benefits from a tax benefit when it is protected and replanted. In the event of the disappearance of a forest area, the owner has five years to replant it.\n\nPacifica has been supporting forest owners for 10 years, making it one of the leaders in this market.\n\n## Targeted exclusions\n\nPacifica, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' property & casualty insurance subsidiary  in  France,  works  mainly  with  individuals  (household and motor insurance, etc.), but also with farmers (cover of up to \u20ac20 million), small businesses (revenue of up to \u20ac3  million) and, since 2020, companies (with revenue of between \u20ac2  million and \u20ac50 million or so) in France.\n\nInsurance products for individual or professional customers are not distributed outside France. Pacifica distributes its multi-risk products to farmers and businesses exclusively in mainland France, which has little exposure to deforestation.\n\nPacifica  offers  import/export  guarantees,  except  where  these concerns embargoed countries.\n\nPacifica excludes the following from cover under multi-risk business insurance:\n\n- z companies involved in the extraction or transformation of coal, oil or gas. This exclusion has been in force since Pacifica started offering insurance to companies: Pacifica's underwriting portfolio therefore has zero exposure to these sectors;\n- z companies designing, manufacturing, selling or transporting munitions and arms banned under international law. This exclusion has been in force since Pacifica started offering insurance to companies: Pacifica's underwriting portfolio therefore has zero exposure to the controversial weapons sector.\n\n## 2.2.5 STEPPING UP THE PREVENTIVE APPROACH\n\nManaged under a dedicated governance structure, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Prevention  Committee,  prevention  has  been  at  the heart of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' customer processes since 2012. Representatives from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and the Regional Banks meet quarterly to identify the main risks and priority actions and to promote preventative measures for the protection of people and property adopted at the national and local levels. The Regional Banks, working with their local ecosystem and mutualist network, develop measures suited to their regions and share their experience in the field. This cooperation translates into coordinated actions, planned and evaluated in light of their usefulness for customers. It has strong unanimous support within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group.\n\nThe current context is marked by a strong change in risks. The Covid-19 crisis in 2020/2021 has put health and safety issues back\n\nat the forefront and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has seen an increase in the number of high-intensity climate and natural events as well as a digitisation of daily uses, which is revealing new 'cyber' risks. The collective ambitions of virtuous and low-carbon growth are accompanied by ever-faster changes in personal and professional mobility. In this environment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's prevention approach, embodied in the 'act every day in your interest and that of society' brand's slogan , offers advice and support to customers in their prevention approach raising awareness among the general public on the protection of their environment or the rules for sharing the road, including supporting business or agricultural managers in their risk prevention plan.",

This course allows them to improve their control of a vehicle in an emergency situation and since September 2023 has included awareness of the principles of eco-driving on a daily basis. Since 2011, more than 250,000 courses have been recommended, with nearly 60,000 completed. A study conducted in 2019 shows a reduction in the frequency of accidents causing personal injury and material damage of around 17.5% over the period from 2014 to 2017 for customers who took the course, compared to a control group who had not completed the course;\n\n- z for professionals and farmers:\n- z training in environmentally-friendly driving is offered to everyone taking out a business vehicle insurance contract,\n- z t he ability to purchase high-quality protective equipment at low prices (carbon monoxide detectors, fire extinguishers for all types of fire\u2026),\n- z the option of benefiting from negotiated services for electrical and fire prevention systems checks, CCTV systems to prevent theft and remote assistance for the elderly;\n- z support for customers who have made repeated claims. After two claims of the same kind, customers receive personalised advice by letter with a personnalized offer  for turnkey services suited to the nature of their claim, for example the contact details of a CCTV partner if the claims were for theft or the contact details of a partner to check electrical systems if the claims were for electrical damage;\n- z proposal of insurance products including support services to help customers and their relatives in the event of death, dependency or disability. Assistance contracts also complement the range of personal risk insurance, thereby providing access to preventive advice.\n\nTo  support  the  security  of  farming  and  professional  customers, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Regional  Banks  have  a  network  of  more  than 28  experts.  These  experts  in  agricultural  and  occupational  risk prevention undergo extensive training at IFCAM (the University of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group) and benefit from continuous upgrades to their skills, like all employees supporting the insurance procedures of customers.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances supports the Regional Banks in offering fun, educational live and digital events for their mutual shareholders on preventing road risks and personal accidents, providing first aid and on the risks of falling for the elderly as well as digital risks.\n\n## Including prevention in the business offering\n\nThe Corporate insurance offer created and rolled out from 2020 by Pacifica was strengthened in 2021 when a risk prevention engineers joined the team to support the proactive preventative measures offered. In practice this means:\n\n- z a holistic approach to prevention through a visit designed to identify risks and appropriate preventative measures, carried out before the multi-risk Corporate policy is taken out;\n- z technical support in prevention/protection and risk reduction for the policyholder during construction projects;\n- z a risk management approach allowing for exhaustive analysis and information on how to prevent the risks to which businesses are exposed (whether covered by an insurance contract or not);\n- z the road risk prevention pack offered to every business taking out a 'Vehicle Fleet' insurance contract includes a one-hour telephone audit (analysis of the vehicle fleet, drivers, tools and the training plan) and an e-learning module (raising staff awareness of the various risks and training them in responsible driving), all provided by Actua Formation, Pacifica's 'go-to' partner for road risks.\n\n1 2",

They  encouraged policyholders to stay safe and provided preventive advice for the weather conditions they were experiencing (storm, snow/ice, floods, and heatwaves for people over 70).\n\n## Helping policyholders look after their health\n\nIn 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances rolled out the 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Ma  Sant\u00e9 '  app  to  help  policyholders  look  after  their  health, including  specialist  and  personalised  content  on  various  health issues, guidance through the healthcare process, online advice and consultations, the option of getting specialist medical advice for important decisions (serious, rare or debilitating illnesses). At the end of 2023, 3,759 teleconsultations had taken place. In addition, the Customer Recommendation index for the teleconsultation service was +65 in 2023. Since 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has also supported policyholders when hospitalised, through its Hospiclair service: help with administrative procedures and promotion of care services to ease convalescence.\n\nOver the coming years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances plans to continue to  develop  these  prevention  program s  to  help  customers  avoid traumatic and costly events and to help tackle climate change.\n\n## 2.2.6 SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS FACING NEW RISKS\n\n## Helping the agricultural world make its transition a success\n\n## Contributing to increase  food sovereignty\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances expects to help one in every four farmers deal to climate issues by 2025.\n\nIn line with the third pillar of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group societal project, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has again confirmed its commitment to the agriculture and food sectors. This is reflected in the offer of cover for their harvests following climate events, to support farmers in their projects to install renewable energy and to encourage the installation of new farmers.\n\nPacifica helps farmers to become more resilient in the face of the challenges of climate change, by offering insurance for most types of crops (field crops, vegetables, vineyards and orchards) to protect against almost all weather events that may affect them including drought, hail, floods, frost, etc. At the end of 2023, Pacifica managed around  37,500  climate  insurance  contracts  (crop  and  grassland insurance).  Contribution  reductions  are  also  implemented  to encourage the use of protection systems, reducing the impact of climate events on crops.\n\nOver the last four years, the issue of the 'agricultural transition' has been brought within the scope of the work, with the aim of identifying  the  new  risks  relating  to  new  agricultural  practices. Indeed, organic farming and new farming practices that are more respectful of the environment continue to attract interest. In 2023, organic crops accounted for 11% of the Harvest insurance portfolio. Pacifica draws on its research to constantly adapt its agricultural insurance offer and provide a tailored solution for farmers making the transition.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to supporting the reform of crop insurance.\n\nOne of the goals of this reform is to double the number of farmers insured in France by 2025. This engagement translates into:\n\n- z active involvement in all working groups with the stakeholders to ensure that this offering provides a sustainable response to protect farmers from climate events;\n- z the introduction of an ambitious support structure of advisors working with farmers to help them make informed choices in the management of climate risks relative to their harvests;\n- z the possibility of being appointed as a contact for the management of uninsured grasslands, under the National Solidarity Fund, by all farmers.\n\nThis commitment to supporting agriculture in its transition is part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's societal project while taking into account the new framework of public/private agricultural risk management systems.\n\n## Support for French agriculture in the development of renewable energy\n\nAs the second biggest insurer of farmers, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to supporting the market and doubling the number of multi-risk insurance contracts for farmers covering renewable energy (PV, co-generation, methanisation) by 2025.\n\nGiven the focus on the transition to greener energy consumption and with agricultural incomes increasingly volatile, the development of renewable energy is a golden opportunity for farms with their considerable  biomass  and  land  resources.  Thus,  the  number  of projects to install photovoltaic panels on roofs or in fields (solar trackers, solar shades) is increasing strongly, as are, to a lesser extent, agricultural methanisation facilities. Insurance for these facilities is essential to protect the renewable energy production business and the farm itself. Pacifica has developed a specific insurance offer to ensure these facilities are covered in the event of an incident. Pacifica is at the heart of the development of the agricultural renewable",

Pacifica encourages Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks network to promote prevention advice to customers during the implementation of their project. As a result of all these measures, the number of farms producing renewable energy insured by Pacifica tripled between 2015 and 2023. Farming enterprises producing renewable energy now represent nearly 9% of Pacifica's portfolio of multi-risk insurance contracts for farmers.\n\n## Contracts which also cover the risks specific to farming\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances supports farmers and their employees in the face of life's unknowns, by offering them health and personal risk products.\n\nAs  farmers  are  particularly  exposed  to  illness  and  accidents, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances offers them a range of solutions which complement  MSA,  their  obligatory  insurance  regime.  These  are designed to meet farmers' specific needs:\n\n- z through its Pacifica entity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances offers top-up individual health insurance and accident insurance for farmers and their families, covering both personal and professional life;\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances offers a contract that covers a loss of income in the event of inability to work, injury or invalidity of the farmer, as well as death insurance contracts, to protect the policyholder's family and ensure the continuity of their enterprise, most notably through 'key person' insurance;\n- z workforce  employers  are  supported  to  protect  their  nonmanagerial employees in health and collective protection, thanks to Groupe Agrica offers, marketed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. These offers are accredited by the social partners of their professional sector. They guarantee employers an appropriate response to their legal and regulatory obligations, and provide employees with high-level social cover and access to social action services.\n\nYoung farmers under the age of 40 or established for less than five years benefit from preferential rates that facilitate their access to the schemes, in the form of a degressive contribution reduction spread over several years.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances provides close support to advisors from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Regional Banks who advise farmers, to maintain and develop their knowledge of the offerings and ensuring these match customer needs, through sales support tools and training.\n\n## Managing pollution risk\n\nThe law of 1 st August 2008 created environmental responsibility for companies based on the 'polluter pays' principle. This law requires that the operator take preventive and protective measures for the environment. In the event of environmental damage (soil pollution, air pollution, damage to surface and underground water quality, or to species and protected natural habitats), the operator's obligations include repairing damage and restoring protected natural habitats, protected areas and species.\n\nThe biodiversity restoration law of 8 August 2016 enshrined in the Civil  Code  the  obligation  to  repair  any  ecological  damage  that\n\nanyone might cause through their activity or their products. Thus, in the event of any non-negligible damage to the elements (flora, air, non-protected species and natural habitats, water, etc.) or the functioning of ecosystems or to the benefits derived by mankind from the environment (landscape enhancement, resources, etc.), the person responsible may be required to repair it.\n\nPacifica has therefore introduced cover, at no additional cost, in its multi-risks business and agricultural contracts insuring the cost of preventing imminent damage to the environment or ecological damage, and repair if they occur nevertheless .\n\nAsbestos is very common in agricultural buildings built before 1997. If a building is damaged, for example by fire or storm, the asbestos must be removed before repairing or rebuilding it. Asbestos removal is  a  costly  operation  and  requires  specialist  skills.  The  all-risks agricultural and business contracts include unlimited reimbursement of asbestos removal costs following a claim event, unless another limit is included in the contract.\n\nSince 2022, Pacifica has joined a specialised co-reinsurance pool (Assurpol), enabling it to offer more comprehensive cover of the risks of accidental and/or gradual pollution, as part of a Multi-Risk Enterprise Environment contract, for damage caused to third parties and the natural environment and that suffered by the insured. This cover is particularly important for businesses with installations that are classified for environmental protection (ICPE) reasons as they are more exposed to these risks.\n\n## Adapting products to new uses and behaviours\n\n## Portability of driver protection insurance for rented vehicles (car and two-wheel vehicle insurance)\n\nNew cooperative patterns of use are emerging in the motor sector. The  main  examples  are  car  sharing  and  peer-to-peer  vehicle rental.  Pacifica  accompanies  them  with,  in  particular,  cover  for both passengers and driver and civil liability cover for car lending. However,  insurance  for  peer-to-peer,  business-to-consumer  and self-service  car  hire  is  generally  of  poor  quality,  particularly  as regards driver protection. To strengthen its position as a responsible bancassurer,  Pacifica's  car  and  two-wheel  vehicles  insurance contracts now include portability of the 'driver protection' cover for hire vehicles. Customers with a Pacifica car insurance contract will therefore be covered for driver injury protection for up to \u20ac2 million with no minimum amount in the event of an accident during the hire period, in addition to the cover provided by the car hire operator's insurance. For two-wheel vehicle insurance customers, driver injury protection cover portability is limited to \u20ac1 million. This additional feature in the car and two-wheel vehicles contracts is included in all contracts at no extra cost.\n\nFrom December 2021, to help customers regardless of the mode of transport they choose and support soft mobility solutions, driver injury protection cover has been extended to include all vehicles driven  or  ridden  by  the  policyholder:  the  insured  vehicle  and borrowed or hired vehicles, as well as bicycles owned or temporarily hired by the policyholder and/or their spouse.\n\n1 2",

These individual electric vehicles include electric scooters, hoverboards, mono-wheels or speedbikes. Pacifica has devised an insurance solution for this new means of mobility by making them eligible for insurance under the two-wheel vehicle contract.\n\n## House sharing with the 'rental accommodation pack' in home insurance contracts\n\nWith the boom in the sharing economy, more and more people are letting their homes out to travellers such as holiday makers, tourists and businessmen, in order to make some extra money. Hosts either make the entire home available, or just one room, for one or more nights. In most cases, hosts use dedicated platforms such as Airbnb and Abritel HomeAway. Given these conditions, Pacifica has adapted its home insurance cover to meet the new needs driven by the sharing economy. The 'rental accommodation pack' is aimed at customers exposed to specific risks when they let out their main or second home:\n\n- z theft and vandalism by travellers;\n- z loss of income in the event of cancellation following an insured event;\n- z civil liability in the event of harm caused to travellers, food poisoning and the customer's safekeeping liability.\n\n## Healthcare for young people abroad\n\nSince 1 st July 2018, Pacifica has provided a healthcare contract to students going abroad on a language course, for an au pair job or to study. Healthcare can be very costly in some countries and often,  students' healthcare cover in France is not valid in other countries. This new product offer gives Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances an opportunity to maintain a relationship with expatriates during their stay. It is available to anyone under the age of 31 and covers\n\nreimbursement of their healthcare costs with no excess, a 24/7 multilingual hotline and assistance cover valid worldwide.\n\n## Cover for bullying/cyber-bullying as part of Personal Accident Insurance contracts\n\nPacifica will pay out for the most minor after-effects of a personal accident  (minimum  of  1%  permanent  functional  impairment). Children under the age of 26 can also be covered for psychological support in the event of harassment or cyber-bullying. In today's world constant use of new communication technologies (telephones and social networks), bullying amongst schoolchildren no longer stops at the school gates. Pacifica has therefore introduced this cover to support children who are victims of bullying during these difficult moments.\n\n## Cyber-protection for small businesses, farmers, companies and non-profits\n\nBy contributing to the growth of remote working, the global pandemic has increased businesses' vulnerability to cyber attacks. Against this background, attacks and ransom demands increased, particularly those involving medium-sized businesses. Smaller companies have seen attack numbers virtually quadruple. These cyber-attacks can affect the financial activity, brand image, reputation and solvency of a company.\n\nThis  is  why,  since  1  January  2019,  Pacifica  has  been  helping customers manage the consequences of a cyber-attack with its Cyber-Protection  product  offer.  Policyholders  enjoy  guaranteed support from specialist partners (IT experts, lawyers, communication experts and data recovery experts). In addition, contracts include cover for damage related to cyber-fraud and cyber-extortion, and 'Cyber civil liability' cover for losses suffered by third parties if their data is breached, used maliciously or attacked (identity theft, virus transmission, etc.).\n\nAn income protection option is also available to cover the gross operating margin in the event of total or partial business interruption following a cyber-attack, or the policyholder cannot operate their business because their IT service provider is unavailable following a  cyber-attack  (cloud,  etc.).  This  option  also  includes  cover  for restoring the policyholder's information system if it is corrupted as a result of a cyber-attack.",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into account when analysing, making and monitoring investment decisions, and has an appropriate reporting system to measure the progress made. Some sectors are also given priority with regard to the importance of certain societal issues (health, renewable energy, financing of the economy) and with the consistency with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's policy. Since the adoption\n\nof Article 173-VI of the energy transition for green growth law, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  has  published  an  ESG-Climate  report  now incorporating the requirements of Article 29 of the Climate Energy Law. This report is available on the website www.ca-assurances.com.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is pursuing its responsible investment strategy.  At  the  end  of  2023,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  held \u20ac12 billion in green bonds, more than \u20ac1.5 billion in social bonds and over \u20ac2.5 billion in sustainable bonds (estimated figures).\n\n## 2.3.1 EMBEDDING ESG CRITERIA MORE DEEPLY IN INVESTMENT DECISIONS\n\n## Embedding ESG criteria in all asset classes\n\n## Amundi filter and ESG ratings\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  relies  on  the  expertise  of  Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's asset management company, as regards integrating extra-financial (environmental, social and governance) criteria. Amundi has produced a set of 37 criteria based on the laws and directives in force and on universally accepted principles. The weighting of each of these environmental, social and governance criteria was determined in line with the issues specific to each business sector.\n\nWithin each business sector, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invests in European companies with the best ESG practices.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances will not invest in issuers proven to have repeatedly breached all or some of the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. Likewise, all issuers that design, manufacture or sell controversial weapons (cluster bombs, etc.) are excluded from the investment portfolios.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances excludes certain sectors and has applied an exclusion policy to the tobacco industry since 2017.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances applies the Amundi ratings methodology to all portfolios under a management mandate. For the corporate facet  (listed  equities  and  bonds),  the  Investment  department ensures that holding limits are respected (depending on the rating of each asset) so that portfolios qualify as 'ESG'. Since 2022, the ESG rating of dedicated equity funds under management must be higher than the ESG index of their investment universe.\n\nThus, at the end of 2023, all listed securities (equities, corporate and sovereign bonds and similar) held directly by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances were covered by an ESG filter. This represents funds\n\nunder management of \u20ac183 billion, out of a total of \u20ac278 billion in assets invested for the purpose of euro funds and own funds.\n\nIn  addition,  for  investments  held  directly  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances' Investment department, an internal ESG analysis in the form of a rating  system has been developed. This has been gradually rolled out sector by sector, notably as part of the due diligence process (carried out prior to a new investment being made). It acts as a governance support tool, helping to identify areas of improvement, in terms of taking ESG matters into account, at companies in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invests.\n\n## Real estate investment\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continues to increase the proportion of real estate assets with environmental certification (such as HQE, BREEAM and LEED) in its office property portfolio. All new program s now include environmental certification.\n\nAt end-2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances held certified real estate assets  with  an  independent  valuation  of  nearly  \u20ac12.5  billion, representing more than 2.3 million m 2 of certified assets out of a total of 4.6 million m 2 .\n\n## Developing shareholder engagement\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a committed shareholder and votes directly for its strategic investments. They are managed by the Investment department, which sits on the Board of Directors of companies in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a shareholder. Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  encourages  the  companies  in  which it invests to communicate more about the ESG aspects of their business. In 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances formalised the main principles  of  its  voting  and  commitment  policy,  which  will  be operational in 2024.\n\n1 2",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances therefore invests in renewable energy through energy infrastructures.\n\nSince 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has joined forces with various partners to invest in renewable energy facilities in both brownfield (already developed) and greenfield (new infrastructure) projects.\n\nThe following investments were made in 2023:\n\n- z partnership with Repsol Renovables and EIP: financing of a 400 MW capacity ;\n- z partnership with Innergex: financing of a 330 MW capacity following the signature of a long-term partnership for the assets in operation and the development portfolio of Innergex in France.\n\n## Contributing to energy transition and financing innovative solutions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invests in green, sustainable and social bonds (over \u20ac15  billion in total at end-2023) and holds shares in three funds in the Ambition Climat market project coordinated by Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts and supported by France Assureurs (\u20ac20 million in each fund).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has also invested in the world's biggest dedicated clean hydrogen fund (which has total target investment of \u20ac1.5 billion), managed by Hy24, a joint venture between Ardian and FiveT Hydrogen. By investing in the future of energy and in different renewable energy sources, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is playing its part in accelerating the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure to contribute to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Calculating the carbon footprint of investment portfolios\n\nBy signing up to the NZAOA in 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its listed equity and corporate bond investment portfolios by 25% between 2019 and 2025.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes a proactive approach to reducing the carbon footprint of its asset portfolios, relying on several levers described earlier.\n\nThe carbon footprint is an indicator that measures the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the operations of companies whose securities are in the portfolio. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses two methods to calculate the indicator: an issuer by issuer approach for part of the portfolio and an overall approach for the portfolio as a whole.\n\nAmundi's bottom-up approach focuses on calculating greenhouse gas emissions at the level of corporate, government and similar issuers.  The  top-down  approach  developed  by  CACIB   (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Corporate  &  Investment  Bank)  maps  greenhouse  gas emissions across the entire asset portfolio by business sector and geographical area.\n\nThe two methods are described in the ESG-Climate report of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nThe overall objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the entire portfolio is based on an annual average reduction in line with national and international objectives (see Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances ESG-Climate report).",

This is a long-term project composed of several stages.\n\nA Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Ethics Charter, drawn up by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' parent company, was distributed to all employees in June 2017. It is always available on the entity's intranet.\n\nThe Code of Conduct distributed since 2018 to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances employees and externally is regularly updated.\n\nIt is intended for all business lines and comprises themed guidance sheets.  They  reflect  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  commitment, implementation, sets out what to do and what not to do, and gives practical examples specific to each theme. Four areas are addressed: customer and supplier relations, environmental and social issues, anti-corruption, and reputation protection.\n\nThere  is  one  single  Code  for  all  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances' employer entities and its subsidiaries, thus strengthening a shared ethics and compliance common culture.\n\nIn support of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' ethical commitments, this Code is distributed internally in all entities (available on the intranet, highlighted in ongoing news items, in a presentation video, in a specific article in the weekly newsletter), in French and in English in order to make it accessible to all employees, including those abroad. It is also available on corporate websites to ensure external visibility.\n\n## Deploying a responsible compliance approach\n\nCompliance  means  adherence  to  legislative  and  regulatory provisions  specific  to  insurance,  banking  and  finance,  to  ethical standards  and  practices,  and  to  the  instructions  issued  by  the executive  body.  Compliance  contributes  to  the  confidence  of stakeholders (customers, staff, investors, regulators, suppliers, etc.) with regard to financial institutions by preventing the risk of judicial, administrative or disciplinary sanctions, significant financial loss or damage to reputation.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Compliance  department  defines  the policy for preventing non-compliance risks, such as the risk of money laundering, financing of terrorism, violation of embargoes, market abuses, conflicts of interest, inadequate protection of customers' or employees' personal data, or inadequate protection of customers.\n\nThe Compliance function has drawn up a number of documents, including:\n\n- z the Ethical Charter adopted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group, translated into 10 languages and given to all new Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group employees;\n- z the Code of Conduct, co-designed with the Corporate Social Responsibility function, given to all new hires and also accessible from the CA Assurances website;\n- z the Fides program , comprising procedural memos setting out the regulations in terms of compliance.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Compliance department must also make sure that effective mechanisms are in place to ensure compliance. To do this, the Compliance function in its entities:\n\n- z advises operations staff by giving opinions on transactions where it is asked to do so and provides business lines with notices of compliance;\n- z intervenes in product approval, governance and monitoring processes;\n- z identifies conflicts of interest in line with the associated Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group policy;\n- z draws up compliance training plans and ensures that compulsory compliance training is effectively received by employees;\n- z monitors the proper operation of systems and transactions.\n\nThe  Compliance  function  uses  the  following  resources  for  this purpose:\n\n- z risk mapping to evaluate non-compliance risks within each entity;\n- z the implementation of compliance standards in procedures, in collaboration with the business lines on all risks of non-compliance (fight against money laundering/terrorist financing and asset freezing, protection of customers and personal data, prevention of corruption and fraud, etc.);\n- z monitoring  of,  and  reporting  on,  compliance  risks  enables assessment of the implementation of the compliance framework and the management of non-compliance risks;\n- z financial security tools including profiling software which are used to detect unusual and/or suspicious transactions, screening tools used to ensure compliance with international sanctions (asset freezes and embargoes) and information sharing tools which are used within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- z compliance tools used to manage employees who hold insider information, and tools to prevent and manage conflicts of interest;\n- z the reports enable compliance with the regulations relating to the crossing of thresholds on securities giving access to the share capital or to the voting rights of issuers.\n\nThis  function  is  performed  by  65  full-time  equivalent  (FTE) employees; the function is structured as a business line within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group in order to ensure the consistency of compliance and financial security practices within the Group.\n\n1 2",

Annual training for all employees is provided to help them understand international sanctions and to become familiar with, and know how, to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Fraud prevention\n\nA fraud prevention system has been deployed in all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  entities.  In  a  climate  of  escalating  external  fraud attempts and growing complexity of fraud methods (particularly via cybercrime), the key challenges lie in a proactive approach on the part of financial system operators. In this respect, awareness is a key component of prevention as it encourages people to be more on their guard.\n\n- A  training  program   specific  to  the  Insurance  business  was implemented in 2015 for the most exposed employees in order to raise their awareness about the risk of fraud and its prevention.\n\nIn addition to specific training, actions to raise employee awareness of the different types of existing and new external fraud to which they could fall victim are regularly organised.\n\n## Prevention and detection of corruption\n\nIn  line  with  its  values,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  believes  that fighting  corruption  is  an  important  element  of  good  business practice.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has deployed a program  to bring its systems into line with the new requirements arising from the Sapin 2 anti-corruption law. Measures include appointing a lead director, the implementation of specific corruption risk mapping, the assessment of third parties and the introduction of a Code of Conduct aiming to prevent inappropriate behaviour, and a whistleblowing procedure.\n\nEmployee training on the stakes of compliance and ethics issues is provided through e-learning with modules covering the following topics:\n\n- z professional ethics and professional conduct;\n- z prevention of external fraud;\n\n- z fight against corruption;\n- z international sanctions;\n- z anti-money laundering;\n- z GDPR.\n\n## Reporting of dysfunctions\n\nThe entire compliance framework (organisation, procedures, training programs ) creates an environment favourable to the enhancement of  the  control  framework  within  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances. Nonetheless,  when  preventive  measures  do  not  fully  play  their expected role and a dysfunction occurs, it must be:\n\n- z detected and then analysed as quickly as possible;\n- z reported to the operational managers and the Compliance functions at the most appropriate level within each business line;\n- z monitored and corrected, and its causes eliminated;\n- z reported to the Supervisory Authority in the case of the most important dysfunctions.\n\nCentralised reporting of dysfunctions in accordance with a specific procedure adopted by each Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity enables exposure to non-compliance risk to be measured at the highest level of the company. Thus, employees who have reasonable grounds to suspect, or who witness, a compliance dysfunction must notify their manager, who will report it to Compliance officers.\n\nThe  Compliance  officers  in  each  entity  report  dysfunctions  to the  Compliance  department,  which  is  responsible  for  informing Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s  Compliance  Management  Committee.  This Committee reviews the report and approves proposals to remedy the dysfunctions.\n\nThis framework is completed by a whistleblowing facility enabling employees  who  witness  an  anomaly  in  the  normal  dysfunction reporting system or who feel under pressure to allow a dysfunction to occur, to notify the entity's Compliance officer of the situation without going through their management. The employee's identity remains anonymous throughout the whistleblowing procedure.\n\n## Conducting a responsible lobbying policy\n\n## Aligning to best practices\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  conducts  its  lobbying  activities  in accordance  with  best  practices  set  out  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. and applied by its entities. In 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. adopted a Lobbying Charter which applies to all of its entities. In 2014, it signed Transparency International France's joint statement, thereby committing to the transparency, fairness and integrity principles recommended  by  the  non-profit.  Lastly,  in  accordance  with  the Sapin  2 law of 9 December 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is registered on the digital register of interest representatives and complies with the guidelines issued by France's High Authority for Transparency in Public life.",

        "page_content": "## Organising in a transparent way\n\nThe Public Affairs unit is responsible for guiding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances'  lobbying  activities.  The  unit  has  three  full-time employees  in  Paris  who  are  in  continuous  contact  with  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.'s Public Affairs department. They regularly present matters to the internal bodies, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Executive  Committee.  This  cross-functional  body  is  thus  made aware of future regulations and drives Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances' lobbying activities.\n\n## Addressing the main issues\n\nThe Public Affairs unit conducts its activity at both French and European  level.  Most  issues  are  addressed  in  close  cooperation with  France  Assureurs  and  Insurance  Europe.  In  2023,  public affairs actions targeted the French public authorities and European institutions, in the context of the review of structuring reforms for insurance such as the Green Industry law or the Retail investment strategy.\n\nThis gave the unit the opportunity to highlight the important role played  by  insurers  in  the  long-term  financing  of  the  European economy and to defend the model of a universal bancassurance sector serving its customers and society. A number of measures have been taken directly and through industry associations on major issues such as the revision of prudential frameworks, sustainable finance regulations and financial products distribution. Lastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances works alongside all of the sector's stakeholders to further increase transparency for retail customers.\n\n## Work to take into account sustainability issues in the economy through regulations\n\nIn line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's societal project and its CSR approach, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  ensures that its regulatory positions are aligned with its strategy and commitments relating to sustainability. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  is consistent with the principles of the international alliances of which it is a member, such as the PRI, PSI and NZAOA.\n\n## 2.4.2 ASSESSING AND MANAGING ESG AND CLIMATE RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has for many years been involved in a sustainable finance approach, in keeping with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Societal Project.\n\n## Assessing and managing transition risks\n\nIn June 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group published its Climate strategy with the aim of stepping up its efforts and its commitments to support   the  energy  transition.  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  fully adheres to this Climate strategy and plays an active role in its governance in order to ensure its implementation.\n\nAs the largest insurer in France and a major institutional investor, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  committed  to  three  key  priorities alongside Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group:\n\n- z supporting all customers in the transition to a low carbon economy:\n- z through its investment activities:\n- -Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is mainly subject to the transition risks resulting from adjustments that issuers will have to make in order to move to a low carbon economy. This would affect the business model of some investments and could have an impact on their value. If these adjustments are not made, the stoppage or regulatory punishment of certain activities deemed to be too polluting or emitting too many greenhouse gases could result in the impairment of the associated assets,\n- -in this context, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its listed investments in equities and corporate bonds by 25% between 2019 and 2025, and in the development of renewable energies with the aim of contributing to finance a production capacity of 14 GW by 2025,\n- z by providing information for its policyholders:\n- -in terms of climate reporting, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances implements the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This working group created\n\nby the G20 during COP 21 defines and issues recommendations of best practices in terms of business transparency on climate issues. In 2017, this COP specified the reporting elements expected in Universal Registration Documents, with four main areas: governance, strategy, risk management and measurement indicators used. In addition to this extra-financial reporting, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances communicates to its policyholders about its ESG-Climate policy via a dedicated publication implementing the TNFD principles,\n\n- z by developing its range of unit-linked funds with an ESG-Climate policy in order to offer customers a wide choice;\n- z integrating across a broad scope environmental, social and governance criteria in its investment processes (see details in the preceding section, 'Acting as a Responsible Investor'):\n- z since 2020, extending the ESG assessment to all new Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances investments and financing to ensure consistency in their economic, social and environmental impacts,\n- z reinforcing the policy for coal with a scenario of withdrawing in 2030. A review of direct and indirect investments in the coal sector was conducted and resulted in the development of a plan to dispose of the main exposures identified,\n- z continuing the regular improvement in measurement of the portfolios' carbon footprint, thanks to the combination of several approaches (sectorial and geographic approach, issuer-level approach, sovereign state approach),\n- z continuing and stepping up partnerships in order to increase investment in the energy and ecological transition. In particular note the 2014  strategic partnership with Engie to develop renewable energies in Europe;\n- z continue investments in renewable energies, for example with the acquisition of a stake in the portfolio of Innergex France, but also in related activities such as battery energy storage via the investment in the French start-up VERKOR in 2023.\n\n1 2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThese actions bring into play the following governance framework:\n\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances takes part in the governance bodies for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group's Climate strategy;\n- z internally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has introduced dedicated societal governance, with several associated steering committees, to integrate societal issues across all business lines (see the Introduction  to  this  chapter).  In  addition,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances' Board of Directors defines and approves all strategic decisions for the company, notably on ESG-Climate matters which could affect company performance. The Investment department works for the majority of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' insurance subsidiary  companies.  With  the  companies,  it  defines  their investment strategies which incorporate ESG-Climate issues. It is then responsible for implementing them. In this respect, it manages relations with all financial services providers (asset management companies, finance and investment banks, etc.) on behalf of the insurance companies.\n\n## Assessing and managing physical risks\n\nThe objective of stepping up the energy transition and supporting customers in this transformation is also reflected in action taken by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances to assess and manage the physical risks related to the climate.\n\nDue to the nature of its business, particularly in property & casualty insurance, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is directly exposed to physical risks related to weather conditions (storms, flooding, hurricanes, hail, drought, etc.). These risks may concern buildings (residential buildings and business or agricultural premises), vehicles and crops in the field. The weight of climate events in the cost of claims varies from one contract to another and can be up to 100% for climate products such as crop, pasture or forest insurance.\n\nTo  manage  these  risks  and  contain  exposure,  a  physical  risk monitoring and management system is in place:\n\n- z identification and assessment of physical risks through quantification based on simulations of general weather event scenarios;\n- z implementation of a physical risk management system to limit the impact of extreme weather events by adjusting pricing and physical risk modelling;\n- z specific monitoring and oversight of exposure to weather events.\n\nTo support its customers and improve their satisfaction with regard to  these  risks,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  continuously  renews or adapts its products and services. The evolution of products to\n\nprotect farmers against climate risk is an example. These include hail insurance for targeted protection of crops against weather events which was redesigned in 2023; crop insurance to protect crop yields and income against weather events (2005) and pasture insurance which guarantees a capital sum to purchase the fodder required by livestock in the event of a severe weather effect on pasture land (2015).\n\nPacifica seeks to bring Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's values of universality to life through the operation of its business.\n\nPricing, based on detailed knowledge of risks and the principle of pooling, is adapted according to the asset's exposure.\n\n## Assessing and managing responsibility risks\n\nResponsibility risks correspond to the damages and compensation that a legal entity may have to pay if it is judged responsible for climate change.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  monitors  this  risk  indirectly  through exposure to climate risks (notably via the indicator of exposure to coal and fossil fuels) and respect for climate commitments.\n\n## Combined risk assessment for transition risks and physical risks\n\nAt the end of 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances took part in the climate pilot exercise organised by the ACPR to carry out stress tests of its portfolios by simulating transition risk scenarios (three scenarios towards a low-carbon economy by 2050), each paired with a physical risk scenario (IPCC 'RCP 8.5' scenario). In May 2021, the ACPR published the results of this exercise in which nine banking groups and 15 insurance groups, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, took part.\n\nIn  2022,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  took  part  in  preparatory workshops for a new exercise with ACPR and France Assureurs.\n\nIn 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances renewed its participation in the climate stress test organised by the ACPR. For this second exercise, a short-term horizon (2027) was added to the long-term horizon (2050) to explore scenarios combining physical risk and transition risk. Three stress scenarios (two long-term scenarios up to 2050 and one short-term scenario) were then proposed, compared with a reference scenario.\n\nAll of these elements contribute to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole   S.A. Group's vigilance plan.",

This second class met for the first session in the Portuguese subsidiary and for the second session in Paris.\n\n## Mobility\n\nIn  line  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   S.A.  Group  policy,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances favours internal mobility to fill job vacancies.\n\nVacancies  are  therefore  published  on  'MyJobs',  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group's job mart, which is open to all employees. Employees can schedule alerts so that they never miss new vacancies. This year, MyJobs was also rolled out at all international entities.\n\nMoreover, employees seeking an internal move are invited to take part in 'Mobilijobs' (a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group scheme that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has joined), which provides opportunities for employees to talk to operational and HR staff of the various Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities to discover job and business line opportunities. They can also take part in pre-selection speed interviews at the same time.\n\nIn 2023, employees at the Paris, Lille and Vaison-la-Romaine sites benefited from conferences, workshops and interviews as part of the launch of the 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Mobility Week'.\n\n## INTERNAL TRANSFERS\n\n| (in  number)                                                        |   2023 |   2022 | Scope                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Intragroup mobility (incoming)                                      |    189 |    112 | Total - France  and International | 100%   | 99.4%  |\n| Intragroup mobility (outgoing)                                      |    157 |    103 | Total - France  and International | 100%   | 99.4%  |\n| Mobility within one entity - Active permanent  employment contracts |    127 |    153 | Total - France  and International | 100%   | 99.4%  |\n\nIncoming transfers refers to recruitment by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances of employees from elsewhere in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group. Conversely, outgoing transfers are those where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances employees join another Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity.\n\nAs part of the Human Project, the survey on the Responsibility Index was renewed and the results were up by 6 points compared to 2022. A reflection on managerial transformation was initiated by the members of the governing bodies in 2023 for implementation during 2024.\n\n## Training\n\nThe training activity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group is always very strong in order to cover the acquisition of key skills useful for the success of our business project. Excluding regulatory training, 2023 ended with nearly 13,000 trainees (+3,000 versus 2022) and 124,000 hours of training (+30,000 hours versus 2022).\n\nConcrete initiatives in support of the commitments made by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole on societal themes have been put in place: climate frescoes, CSR web conference, awareness-raising actions on gender equality, training of hiring managers on decision-making biases, training of 100% of our managers in the prevention of psychosocial risks.\n\nDeployment of program s promoting the empowerment of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances   managers  and  employees  as  well  as  the emergence of new, more hybrid and agile working methods.\n\nAnd launch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group integration days, designed  as  a  time  for  sharing  and  experimentation  with  the practices and stances put forward as part of the human project (trust, collaborative methods, feedback culture, etc.).\n\nThese actions will continue and some will be amplified in 2024.",

With 75% of contributions paid by the company, this plan is more advantageous than the requirements set out in the collective agreement.\n\nSeveral actions have been put in place to reduce psycho-social risks, including:\n\n- z the installation of a new health at work space bringing together the multidisciplinary team available to employees, both physically and virtually, including a social worker and a psychologist-coach;\n- z the recruitment of an OHS specialist who assesses the risks of each of the company's activities and implements actions with all stakeholders in order to offer safe working conditions, a positive environment favourable to the development of all,\n- z the launch of a survey to identify and diagnose pyscho-social risks and any potentially risky working conditions,\n- z the implementation of a charter for the prevention of PSR and the right to disconnect within one of our entities,\n- z training of managers in the prevention of psychosocial risks in most of our entities,\n- z measures to promote a good work-life balance and protect the right to disconnect.\n\nIn  addition,  on  the  occasion  of  Pink  October,  awareness-raising actions were organised throughout the month in conjunction with the sponsorship, creditor insurance and occupational health teams. A doctor from the Institut Curie enabled employees at our three main  sites  to  learn  procedures  for  early  detection.  In  addition, various events made it possible to donate \u20ac31,000 to Institut Curie.\n\nAwareness-raising actions and individual interviews to encourage smoking cessation were offered at the three main sites at the end of the year.\n\nLastly, a flu vaccination program  was rolled out at all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances sites.\n\n1 2",

In terms of recruitment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities seek to attract diverse profiles including people with two to five years higher education, people on work-study contracts and interns as well as experienced employees. The determining factors are experience, skills and development potential.\n\nIn  addition,  with  respect  to  disabilities,  increased  and  regular awareness-raising  initiatives  and  communications  on  diversity allowed Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances target set in the sixth Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's agreement to be met in terms of the number\n\nof disabled people recruited. This year, the theme of the SEEPH was digital inclusion with demonstrations of start-ups that have developed solutions to facilitate the daily life of employees with dyslexia and hearing impairments. The proportion of employment of employees with disabilities increased again this year to reach 3.6%.\n\nMore generally, diversity and inclusion being one of the five priority HR  areas  of  the  corporate  project,  the  actions  of  the  Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the ambassador networks in France and in international entities continued throughout the year with a highlight in November on the occasion of the Group's Diversity Month. On this occasion, two web conferences for all employees, meetings between ambassadors and Executive Management, and a webinar for managers were organised. In addition, an acculturation content platform on Diversity and Inclusion is now accessible to all employees.\n\n## NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES HIRED EXTERNALLY ON PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (IN FRANCE AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES)\n\n| (in  number)                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| France                                             | 307    | 287    |\n| International                                      | 130    | 118    |\n| TOTAL RECRUITS WITH PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS | 437    | 405    |\n| Coverage: Total France                             | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nAware that gender equality and diversity are factors of performance for the company and of well-being for their employees, the main subsidiaries of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances have signed professional equality agreements aimed at ensuring this equality in the field of  human  resources:  recruitment,  training,  career  management, compensation, etc. These agreements also provide for measures in favour of parenthood with reserved cradles in the Babilou network and the granting of CESUs for new parents during the first year after the birth of a child.\n\nIn addition, the StOpE ordinary sexism in the workplace charter was signed in January by the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances .  This  charter  defines  eight  commitments  already implemented in the company. In addition, mandatory training has been set up to raise awareness among all employees on the subject and to prevent any sexist behaviour. Combating all forms of sexism in the workplace is an essential lever for gender diversity.\n\nThe gender balance remains stable, both in France and internationally.\n\n## REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN\n\n|                                                                    | 2023   | 2023   | 2023   | 2022   | 2022   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| (in  number)                                                       | No.    | Base   | %      | No.    | Base   | %      |\n| Among all employees                                                | 1,899  | 3,580  | 53.1%  | 1,762  | 3,316  | 53.1%  |\n| Among permanent contract employees                                 | 214    | 76     | 56.5%  | 229    | 405    | 56.5%  |\n| Among the Executive Committee                                      | 4      | 20     | 20.0%  | 5      | 25     | 20.0%  |\n| Among the top 10% of highest-earning  employees in each subsidiary | 113    | 354    | 26.8%  | 86     | 321    | 26.8%  |\n| Coverage: Total France + International                             |        |        | 100.0% |        |        | 99.4%  |\n\n## PROMOTIONS\n\n|                                        | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in  number)                           | Men          | Women        | Total        | Total        |\n| Promotions in the non-manager category | 29           | 92           | 121          | 104          |\n| Promotions from non-manager to manager | 14           | 21           | 35           | 20           |\n| Promotions in the manager category     | 99           | 118          | 217          | 208          |\n| TOTAL PROMOTIONS                       | 142          | 231          | 373          | 332          |\n| Percentage                             | 38%          | 62%          | 100%         | 100.0%       |\n| Coverage: France                       | 100.0%       | 100.0%       | 100.0%       | 100.0%       |",

        "page_content": "Moreover, company-level agreements were signed in most Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' employer entities. These agreements contain a number of commitments in terms of gender balance and diversity, such as:\n\n- z a guarantee that job applications will be treated equally;\n- z the allocation of an annual budget to reduce pay gaps;\n- z measures  facilitating  the  return  to  work  after  maternity  or adoption leave (HR interviews, gradual resumption of work, option to work part time with no impact on career development and compensation);\n- z payment of the basic salary during paternity leave.\n\nThe  gender  equality  index  exceeds  85%  for  all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances entities.\n\nLastly, for all new executive and senior management hires, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances endeavours to draw up a mixed short list of candidates.\n\n## Age equality\n\n## INTERNSHIPS AND WORK-STUDY CONTRACTS\n\nSince December 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has been delivering on its commitment, in particular through two key measures:\n\n- z promoting the inclusion of young people from underprivileged areas by offering work experience;\n\n- z placements across Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group to 13 to 15 year-olds from priority education areas;\n- z helping young people to access employment through workstudy contacts by increasing the number of contracts offered (this objective was achieved by supporting the 1jeune1solution movement launched in 2020);\n- z welcoming 50,000 young people in France and internationally by 2025 in all activities and business lines.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances maintained and expanded its recruitment campaign  this  year,  welcoming  66  long-term  interns  and  258 apprentices. They benefited from a dedicated half-day induction session, which was held on site this year.\n\nThe tutors received special training or support in most entities.\n\nAt the end of the scheme, tutors fill in a questionnaire to assess apprentices and recommend them if applicable. These students are then systematically interviewed by HR with a view to offering them permanent or temporary job opportunities within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances wherever possible. The rate of conversion from workstudy contracts to permanent and fixed-term contracts was 49% in 2023.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances gave two presentations to 13- to 15-yearold students from priority education areas and eight students were welcomed for an internship in December.\n\n## AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNSHIPS AND WORK-STUDY CONTRACTS OVER THE YEAR\n\n| (average number of employees over the year)   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Internships                                   | 28     | 25     |\n| Work-study contracts                          | 182    | 159    |\n| Coverage: Total France                        | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n\n## SENIORS\n\nIn France, each  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  subsidiary  has implemented  a  proactive  policy  to  support  seniors,  the  main objective  of  which  is  to  keep  them  in  employment.  The  steps frequently taken in this respect by entities include:\n\n- z commitment to professional development for seniors in terms of training and compensation;\n- z managing the end of career and the transition between work and retirement and implementing a system to gradually reduce hours with the option of working part time;\n- z specific training for employees aged over 55 on preparing for their retirement.\n\nNegotiations should be opened in 2024 and thus enrich current arrangements.\n\n## Compensation policy\n\nCompensation policy and practice within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities are based on a number of principles:\n\n- z equity and transparency: in order to guarantee equitable practices, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to defining and applying\n\na shared framework which is widely distributed to all management lines, notably during the launch of compensation campaigns. These campaigns conclude with wage review committees which ensure the uniform application of the framework across all organisations. In addition, with the help of information provided by internal and external benchmarking, the HR department identifies employees who, for a given function, show a significant gap with market practice (salary index < 80%): a dedicated budget is then set aside to address the most significant cases of inequality;\n\n- z reward for collective and individual performance: all employees at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances enjoy a compensation package including Individual Variable Compensation (recognising individual performance) and Collective Variable Compensation (incentive plans and/or profit-sharing). These systems, which are also the subject of regular communication, have been structured to ensure recognition for individual performance and a share in the value generated by collective performance and success;\n- z competitiveness: annual surveys of compensation help ensure that employees are offered compensation packages in line with the reference market and thus address the issues of attracting and retaining the human resources necessary to the development of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\n1 2",

Their sole obligation is to be on site for at least two days in each consecutive two-week period;\n- z additional remote working days are granted to:\n- z employees who are carers,\n- z employees with disabilities,\n- z women who have made a pregnancy declaration;\n- z remote working arrangements are mutually agreed between the employee and their manager, taking into account the organisational and operational needs of the department.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continues to support employees who are carers, in particular by giving them more time off and more flexibility. All colleagues can donate days of leave or time off in lieu (up to a maximum of five days per year) which are given to employees who are carers. Thanks to solidarity between employees, nearly 328 days of caregiver leave were used in 2023, an increase of 13% compared to the previous year by beneficiaries. In 2023, the Group committed to continuing its support for carers, with a target of 25,000 carers supported in 2025.\n\n## 2.4.4 REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF OPERATIONS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a financial services company and its operations do not have any major direct impact on the environment. Its main direct greenhouse gas emission is carbon dioxide ( via the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity). The most harmful waste comes from electronic items, for which collection and processing procedures are in place. Paper is the main raw material used.\n\nTo reduce its environmental impact and serve as an example to stakeholders, it is of fundamental importance that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances reduce emissions relating to its operational footprint. Thus,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  focused  its  environmental management and reporting efforts on three priority areas: mobility; company operations (consumption of energy and water, buildings management, responsible IT, freight); and purchasing. These efforts have come alongside awareness-building amongst employees to create  a  collective  and  sustainable  reduction  in  the  operational environmental footprint. The reporting scope has changed since 2022, with the sale of La M\u00e9dicale de France to the Generali Group and the inclusion of CA Vita (Italy). In line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's  Net  Zero  commitment,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has undertaken to reduce the impact of its environmental footprint in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group has defined three targets for 2030 for reducing its operational footprint using a methodology based on the GHG Protocol and aligned with a limitation of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, in accordance with the recommendations of the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\nIn addition, the reduction target for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group is broken down into subsidiary-level targets, taking into account the degree of decarbonisation already achieved on their respective operating\n\nfootprints (carbon footprint excluding financing and investments and excluding insurance):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' contribution to the Net Zero objectives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

These stewards have been made aware of the environmental issues related to paper and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group's commitments. They are not only responsible for reporting, but also for:\n\n- z encouraging the purchase of certified (PEFC, FSC, etc.) or recycled paper;\n- z promoting paperless communication between employees, with the banking and partner networks, and with customers that opt for paperless communications;\n- z reducing the amount of paper used for business correspondence by  grouping  life  insurance  (Predica)  correspondence  with banking correspondence, double-sided printing for business correspondence (insurance certificates, death & disability renewal notices, etc.) and for annual statements, as well as using thinner paper. Employee payslips are now paperless.\n\nConsiderable work was done by Pacifica to send 100% of eligible letters in electronic format while also reducing the weight of general terms  and  conditions  documents.  Customers  can  agree  (or  not agree) to receive their documents in electronic format. To encourage them to do so, an awareness campaign was organised in 2020. This allowed for a reduction in paper consumption as well as carbon emissions relating to transporting these documents.\n\nParticular efforts have been made in ink use, which has been reduced by 30%, and in the manufacture of envelopes used for administrative purposes at Predica. Envelopes are made from 100% recycled, FSCcertified paper manufactured in France. The transparent window is made from transparent plant material (biodegradable bioplastic from agricultural plant waste), and the glue used is plant-based.\n\nIn the offices of the main French subsidiaries, printers are now shared and their default settings are double-sided and black and white. Launched in 2017, the system of employee badges to operate photocopiers  was  expanded  when  the  company's  photocopiers were upgraded. This reduces printing, as documents are only printed when strictly necessary.\n\n## PAPER INDICATORS\n\n|                                 | 2023         | 2022         |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total consumption               | 1,051 tonnes | 1,304 tonnes |\n| Proportion of responsible paper | 97%          | 76%          |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding CMUs + CA Vita (Italy).\n\n## Energy\n\nSince January 2019, buildings in Paris have been managed by the General Resources and Safety team. It monitors and controls energy consumption in the buildings and contributes to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' reporting.\n\nFor buildings in the greater Paris region, various measures have been taken to better control energy use based on in-depth knowledge of the sites (occupation techniques and types) and the outcome of energy audits. These actions include:\n\n- z optimisation of lighting timer settings (reduction of time slots), of terminals (fan-coil units), air processors (ventilation), car park extractors, circulation pumps, etc.;\n- z replacement of lighting with LEDs in the back kitchens and car parks of certain buildings in Paris;\n- z replacement of air handling units;\n- z some equipment made responsive to the outside temperature ( e.g. circulation pumps, different ventilation temperatures depending on the outside temperature, hot air curtain, etc.);\n- z changes to the temperature settings for hot and cold water;\n- z installation of innovative equipment to measure electrical signals to better understand how the buildings operate;\n- z installation of an energy loss sensor at the Paris sites to enable better response times;\n- z building closure on weekends to shut down the building in terms of energy consumption.\n\nSince 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has fitted Smart Impulse technology to its buildings in Paris to track energy consumption item by item and manage it to achieve energy consumption reduction targets.\n\nOn  11 th October  2022,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Group  signed  up  to  the Ecowatt system and undertook to reduce its energy use for heating and lighting and take the measures necessary on each site for more frugal energy management.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances,  as  a  responsible  company  and employer, has adopted three measures to help reduce its electricity consumption: reducing the set temperature in offices to 19\u00b0C in winter, increasing the set temperature to 26\u00b0C in summer, shutting down the 'all fresh air' treatment system in communal areas and turning off the hot water supply in WC hand basins.\n\nIn 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group also signed the Commitment Charter for the sobriety of private tertiary buildings.\n\nThis approach, supported by the Sustainable Building Plan and the ADEME, aims to maintain the mobilisation of stakeholders around the issues of sobriety, to monitor the implementation of related actions and to facilitate the exchange and sharing of experience between the signatories.\n\nEmployee  awareness-raising  actions  complement  this  system  to sustainably reduce electricity consumption.\n\n1 2",

The decreases were due notably to the energy-saving measures introduced since 2022: stopping of the system introduced under health protocols (operation of facilities on an 'all fresh air' basis), reduction in the recommended temperature to 19\u00b0C in winter and increase in recommended temperature to 26\u00b0C in summer, and reduction of water temperatures in hand basins.\n\nFurthermore, heating oil is only used on one site, which is equipped with a heat pump. The oil-fired boiler is only used to supplement the  heat  pump  in  extremely  cold  weather,  which  explains  why consumption varies substantially from year to year.\n\nUrban  heating  consumption  appears  to  have  increased  in  2023 compared  to  2022.  This  increase  was  due  to  low  consumption in 2022 due to the closure of a building for more than a month following an outbreak of fire in a technical room.\n\nIn 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances renewed its Green electricity agreement with EDF for two sites in Paris and its site in Vaison-laRomaine for a further five years. At a Paris site and the Lille site, green energy contracts were also signed in 2022 with EKIVOLT and EDENKIA.  Since  2022,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  therefore been using 100% renewable electricity for all its French sites. This electricity  is  purchased  under  Certificates  of  Guaranteed  Origin mostly issued by French hydroelectric electricity generators.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to reducing its direct carbon footprint, in particular by designing low-carbon office buildings with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Immobilier to house Pacifica's claims management units (CMUs). These are office buildings aiming to achieve the most demanding labels and certifications in the market, such as HQE Excellent and the B\u00e2timent Bas Carbone (BBCA) low-carbon labels, E+C- level E3/C2 and BiodiverCity \u00ae .\n\nPer 1 m 2 of built space, the Claims Management Units have a carbon impact 2.5 times lower than new traditional buildings.\n\nThe first two sites were inaugurated in 2023 in Caen and Grenoble. The next sites will be delivered in 2024 in Saint-\u00c9tienne, Dijon and Pau.\n\n## Waste management\n\nIn 2019, the Paris sites converted to flex offices were fitted with centralised collection points for sorting using different types of bins for cardboard, paper, cans, plastic bottles, etc. All of the Paris sites are now equipped with these collection points.\n\nSince 2019, waste from the Paris premises are now collected and re-sorted at 36-44 boulevard de Vaugirard (and no longer taken to Montrouge) before recycling. At the Lille premises, an ESAT (a  support through work organisation) is responsible for collecting and sorting paper.\n\n## WASTE INDICATORS\n\n|                             |          | 2023  2022 Estimate *   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Total quantity of waste     | 184 tons | 106  tons               |\n| Quantity of recovered waste | 128 tons | 44  tons                |\n\nFootnote : all waste collected (DIB, paper, plastic, cardboard, glass, metal, bio-waste, caps, cigarette butts and batteries) by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in France excluding UGS + CA VITA (Italy).\n\n- * Extrapolation from H1 2022.\n\nThe increase in the volume of waste is mainly due to the post-Covid recovery of building activities (catering, event activity, etc.), the greater presence of employees on site and the increase in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  headcount.\n\nSince 2023, waste collection and recovery have been extended at Parisian buildings thanks to new partnerships:\n\n- z with Cyclop for cigarette butts;\n- z with Les Alchimistes for bio-waste from company restaurants, which is now recycled into compost.\n\nAll waste paper, plastic, cardboard, glass, metal, bio-waste, stoppers, cigarette butts and batteries are now recycled.\n\nInk  cartridges  are  collected  exclusively  by  Canon,  the  machine supplier, which has its own sustainable development procedure.\n\nComputers (stationary and laptops) at the end of their useful life, that is to say that are more than five years old or have a 'broke' status (obsolete, broken, etc.) are collected by Olinn, which ensures recycling according to D3E standards for equipment out of service or obsolete and ensures the recovery of equipment in working order. In 2023, a donation of 184 computers was made to several nonprofits such as Konnio, Kodiko and Emma\u00fcs Connect in response to their needs. An internal process is being validated to be able to renew this operation annually.",

It showed that an employee emits an average of eight tonnes of CO2 equivalent of greenhouse gases per year (organisational scope). On a scope identical to the previous Bilan Carbone carried out in 2021 (without the Viaren and UAF Life Patrimoine entities), GHG emissions were slightly down to 7.8 tCO2e per FTE in 2022, compared to 8.2 per FTE in 2021.\n\nBy item, the results are as follows:\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES  2022 BILAN CARBONE BY ITEM (FRANCE SCOPE) CARRIED OUT WITH GREENLY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurchase of services\n\nTo measure its footprint more accurately, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has undertaken to carry out a Bilan Carbone\u00ae assessment (carbon footprint) for each of its international subsidiaries by 2025 and to carry out an annual Bilan Carbone\u00ae assessment of its French entities from 2022.\n\n## TRAVEL INDICATORS\n\n|         | Distances travelled (in thousands of kilometres)   | Distances travelled (in thousands of kilometres)   | Distances travelled (in thousands of kilometres)   |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|         | Rail                                               | Air                                                | Total                                              |\n| 2023    | 6,220                                              | 2,814                                              | 9,034                                              |\n| 2022    | 3,202                                              | 1,738                                              | 4,940                                              |\n| Changes | 94%                                                | 62%                                                | 83%                                                |\n\nScope: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances France excluding CMUs + CA Vita (Italy).\n\nIn line with the transport policy, trains remain the preferred means of travel: 69% of kilometres travelled in 2023.\n\nWith regard to the car fleet policy, a new vehicle catalogue was set up in December 2022 with the aim of reducing emissions. It does not include any of the vehicles subject to the penalty that was in force in 2021. One third of the listed vehicles are fully electric, one third plug-in hybrids and the remainder standard hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\nIn addition, the Sustainable Transport Pass  (STP) allows companies to make a financial contribution to employees to help finance all or part of their 'green' transport between their home and workplace. This system is in line with the ambitions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' societal pillar and its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Set at \u20ac550 per year, it is free of tax and social security contributions.\n\nWhen  combined  with  the  compulsory  reimbursement  of  public transport costs, the payment is increased to \u20ac650. All employees are eligible (permanent, fixed-contract, part-time and interns) and the annual amount can be paid pro rata to the date of joining the company. Only those employees with a company car are not eligible for the STP.\n\nThe eco-driving coaching with WeNow has been repeated for drivers of company cars. This program  encourages employees to adopt eco-driving thanks to personalised advice and eco-driving score challenges. The average consumption score improved positively in 2023 and reflects the mobilisation of drivers to limit energy waste. This average fuel consumption score compares, over a given trip, the actual fuel consumption with the minimum fuel consumption that could have been achieved with the same vehicle.\n\n## Travel policy\n\nIn order to limit its direct environmental footprint, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has worked on the carbon impact related to employee travel, the second largest generator of CO2 emissions. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has therefore drawn up a travel policy to encourage the use of transport with the least impact and to encourage more virtuous practices:\n\n- z rail travel to be used wherever possible and systematically for some destinations;\n- z better management of air travel: only permitted for journeys of more than three hours, no first class travel, direct flights preferred;\n- z installation of videoconferencing equipment in all premises;\n- z use of remote working.\n\nSince April 2023, a new online travel booking tool has made it possible to display to users travel proposals in line with the Group's Travel Policy (in particular in terms of CSR) as well as the associated CO2 emissions for each transport proposal.\n\nThis  is  why  this  travel  policy  will  change  in  2024  to  integrate decarbonisation issues and encourage the use of more sustainable forms  of  mobility  (for  example:  transport  by  train  preferred, introduction  of  bicycle  mileage  allowances,  recommendation  of electric vehicle rentals).\n\nAfter two years marked by the health situation, business travel resumed in 2022. The recovery was accentuated in 2023, but travel still remains at a lower level compared to 2019 (11,589 thousand km travelled in 2019).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Knowledge of societal issues and challenges is key so that each employee can be an actor in the Societal Project, which is why an evolving and progressive training course on CSR issues was launched in 2023 and punctuated by several highlights:\n\n- z a launch webconference in April;\n- z the launch in April of a mandatory e-learning training course on CSR issues that covers the key concepts of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the main societal issues, as well as the commitments and actions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group to meet these societal challenges. At the end of November 2023, 74% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  employees had completed this training module. This is a good step forward that brings us closer to our target of 100% by 2025;\n- z climate  frescoes  have  multiplied  in  the  BUs/SUs.  In  total, 1,162 employees have been able to perform a Climate Fresco at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  since 2019;\n- z specific business line training has been rolled out in certain BUs/ SUs to meet the needs of business line departments (eco-design training for IT projects, awareness of responsible digital technology, responsible purchasing training, etc.).\n\nTo strengthen this system, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  employees were invited to the 'CSR Meetings', a quarterly information session\n\nwith a webconference and a mobilisation session with collective action. In the presence of representatives of the Group's various business lines and external experts, these meetings make it possible to decipher a subject related to the societal project and to present our action levers to be a fully responsible insurer, investor and company.\n\nA community of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  CSR Ambassadors was created at the end of 2022. Representatives of their departments on societal issues related to our Responsible Company commitments, these  ambassadors  promoted  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances 's  CSR commitments  locally.  They  also  mobilised  their  team  around collective projects and/or carry out local actions within their BU/SU.\n\nA CSR section is accessible to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances entities on the intranet. It provides information about general CSR issues and about Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' approach, in particular.\n\n## Company restaurant\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances works with its service provider Sodexo on improving practices at its Paris Vaugirard company restaurant.\n\nIn terms of the supply chain for meat products, Sodexo mainly purchases labelled products that include animal welfare in their specifications,  such  as  the Bleu-Blanc-Coeur and Label  Rouge labels. Similarly, for fish products, Sodexo mainly purchases Pavillon France label fresh products from French fisheries that guarantee more  environmentally-friendly  fishing  practices  (selective  fishing methods, respect for the seasonality of products, etc.).\n\nThe catering service provider has been collecting Nespresso coffee capsules and sorting them for recycling since 2017. Selective sorting was  introduced  in  the  restaurant  in  January  2018  for  separate collection of cardboard and cans, glass bottles and bio-waste.\n\nSince January 2023, a partnership with Les Alchimistes has made it possible to collect and recycle bio-waste from company restaurants based in Paris.\n\n## 2.4.5 DEPLOYING A RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING POLICY\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances applies and respects Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group  S.A.'s responsible purchasing policy in order to meet the major challenges of the future and contribute to the company's overall performance. This focuses on 5 pillars :\n\n- z ensuring responsible behaviour in supplier relationships;\n- z contributing to the economic competitiveness of the ecosystem;\n- z integrating environmental and societal criteria in purchasing;\n- z fostering  lasting  improvements  in  the  quality  of  supplier relationships;\n- z integrating  this  responsible  purchasing  policy  with  existing governance structures.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' 'purchasing' Procedural Note respects the fundamentals of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group S.A.'s CSR process for purchasing.\n\nThe guiding principles of its CSR policy are:\n\n- z UN Global Compact;\n- z Diversity Charter;\n- z Responsible Supplier Relations Mediation Charter.\n\nAll the commitments cover human rights and labour regulations, combating  all  forms  of  discrimination,  promoting  diversity, environmental protection and business ethics.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances wishes to encourage its suppliers, service providers and their sub-contractors to share these commitments by observing the principles set out in the international conventions, the laws and regulations in the country where they operate, and practices in their business sector, and more specifically in terms of:\n\n- 1. human rights;\n- 2. diversity and working conditions;\n- 3. the environment;\n- 4. business ethics.",

The Charter is a joint initiative between French banks and insurance companies that wish to encourage their suppliers to implement duty of vigilance measures as part of their CSR approach. It sets out:\n\n- z the commitments made by the signatories to their suppliers in terms of fairness, ethics and transparency, reciprocal dependence, respect for payment periods, confidentiality and intellectual property rights, small and mid-size suppliers, and recourse to mediation;\n- z the commitments made by suppliers in terms of the environment, human rights and labour, business ethics, sub-contracting, progress approach, and monitoring compliance with the Charter;\n- z the reference texts: the 10 principles of the Global Compact, the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\n## Assessing its suppliers\n\nControlling supplier risk and compliance is a major challenge. It is based around a 360\u00b0 vision of suppliers including monitoring their financial  health,  their  economic  dependency,  the  completeness of  their  legal  documentation,  supplier  scoring,  their  screening (suppliers under sanctions including OFAC, Sapin  2 and duty of vigilance) and lastly their CSR rating. The processes adopted include a Know Your Supplier (KYS) system. These risks are monitored by a Group Executive Supplier Risks Committee, which manages the systems for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiaries.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  receives  a  dashboard  from  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group Purchasing department on the main CSR indicators shared across all Group entities (including the Regional Banks) and used in the main entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group.\n\nThese suppliers are assessed on their CSR policies not only in terms of their management system, but also in terms of their products themselves.\n\nEvaluation  of  the  supplier's  CSR  management  system,  which  is systematically requested during the tender process, is entrusted to a specialist, independent third party, EcoVadis. This approach is led by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. The scoring principle involves sending suppliers a questionnaire based on four themes:  environment, social matters, ethics and supply chain management. 5,421 suppliers common to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group entities have been rated to date.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a participant in the 'Purchasing lowcarbon trajectory' project run by the purchasing function of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group which aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe roadmap for 2024 is based on four areas:\n\n- z supporting Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group suppliers in their knowledge of decarbonisation:\n- z information on current regulations,\n- z knowledge of available financial aid and existing training,\n- z be a partner to take stock of the carbon footprint;\n- z contractually engaging suppliers in a process of reducing their carbon footprint:\n- z complete report on emissions,\n- z third-party verification,\n- z science-based goal definitions,\n- z definition of an action plan,\n- z calculation of the carbon footprint for each product;\n- z making a carbon footprint measurement tool available to all suppliers;\n- z implementation of carbon footprint reduction levers by purchasing family and implementation of monitoring.\n\n## Raising awareness amongst buyers and suppliers\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances buyers are made aware of responsible purchasing at meetings run by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.'s Purchasing department.\n\nEveryone involved in the purchasing function receives training in responsible purchasing provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group.\n\nA specific policy of sourcing from companies in the sheltered sector has been implemented for the purchasing function.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has received the Relations fournisseurs et  achats  responsables label  (LRFAR  -  Responsible  Supplier Relations and Purchasing) and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group, with the contribution of new entities, confirmed in 2021 that LRFAR labelling would continue for three years.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s  organisation  and  actions  and  those  of  its subsidiaries were certified to be at a 'convincing' level relative to the ISO 20400 standards.\n\nIn 2019, the purchasing policy was assessed on the basis of EcoVadis rating criteria. It obtained a score of 70/100.\n\n1 2",

This pilot program , launched from May to the end of December 2023, will be the subject of a review to determine the terms and conditions of the program 's continuation in 2024.\n\nThis year, around a hundred assignment offers were available, continuously  updated  and  geolocated  to  enable  employees located throughout France to commit their working hours for a maximum of five days in 2023. The assignments offered to employees in this context can also be carried out, if they wish, outside their working hours.\n\nSince the launch of the J'agis program  in May 2023, more than 200 skills sponsorship and volunteering missions have been carried out.\n\nThere is a monthly newsletter focusing on sponsorship and solidarity issues.\n\nIn addition to this program , collective actions are regularly offered to employees ( Octobre Rose , D\u00e9cembre Solidaire , etc.). As part of the 'Payroll donation' program , they can also donate the cents of their salary to a non-profit elected by them each year. In 2023, the ' L'Envol ' non-profit will benefit from the global donation doubled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\n## A long-term commitment to sponsorship\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' sponsorship program s are, at present, focused  on  two  areas:  social  cohesion  and  inclusion,  and  the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Strengthening social cohesion and inclusion\n\n## PROMOTING BETTER INCLUSION FOR CARERS\n\nFor over 10 years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has been engaged in a policy to sponsor family caregivers by financing community projects throughout France. Caregivers play a key role in intergenerational solidarity and home care for dependent people.\n\nIn 2023, the 13 th call for projects to help carers was based on three emerging or developing themes in support for caregivers:\n\n- z developing 'go-to' approaches;\n- z fighting against regional inequalities;\n- z strengthening the role of caregivers in inclusive housing.\n\nProjects are selected by a committee made up of people from civil society  (sociologist,  geriatrician,  journalist,  French  Association  of Caregivers, the CNSA, etc.) and members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group.\n\nSince  2010,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  received  over  1,550 applications, especially from the Regional Banks that promote the initiative. At the end of 2023, 200 local projects had been financed and more than \u20ac2.5 million distributed.\n\nIn 2023, a 'Jury's Choice Prize' provided the chosen charity with six months' support from a consulting firm to help consolidate its financial model, define a three-year development strategy for its resources and develop the skills and tools needed to improve its efficiency.\n\nThe  other  winning  charities  received  two  days  of  'Developing my resources and communication to support my charity project' training, provided with the support of a consulting firm.\n\nIn 2024, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to continuing its support for carers, with a target of 25,000 carers supported in 2025.\n\n## SUPPORTING REFUGEES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances provides financial support to the Kodiko charity, which works on the inclusion of refugees in the world of work,  and  the  involvement  of  a  dozen  employee-tutors  in  the program .\n\n## SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has set up financial support for the T\u00e9l\u00e9maque non-profit, which works on the socio-cultural opening of young people from modest backgrounds, and the commitment of 10 employees/tutors.\n\n## TACKLING ILLITERACY\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances supports StopIllettrisme , which tackles illiteracy in the workplace, and the involvement of 20 employeetutors in a training program  for workers at the cleaning services provider in Paris.\n\n## SUPPORTING EMPLOYEE'S COMMITMENT\n\nAmong  its  philanthropic  actions,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances has been financing since 2011 the call for projects called J'AgisParrainage associatif (formerly the ' Courte Echelle ' call for projects), for its employees involved in public interest organisations or wishing to have a project by a non-profit of their choice supported.\n\nThese charitable projects span international solidarity, environmental protection and social inclusion.\n\nIn 2023, the Employees' Choice Prize was continued. This allowed employees to vote on the project of their choice, with the winner receiving  an  additional  donation.  The  winning  non-profits  of the call for projects are also supported as part of a training day 'Developing my resources and my communication to serve my associative project'.",

The fund is dedicated to  accelerating  forest  replanting  in  France  by  providing  owners engaged  in  sustainable  forestry  with  the  funding  they  need  to replant their land (in the form of an interest-free advance repayable over 30 years).\n\nThe support of 'Plantons pour l'Avenir' in 2023 contributed to:\n\n- z the planting of 183,704 trees, reforesting 165.5 hectares under sustainable management;\n- z the protection of 273 forestry jobs.\n\nSince  2018,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  donations  have  funded the  planting  of  1,255,407  trees  reforesting  1,041  hectares  under sustainable management.\n\nThrough  these  two  program s,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has committed to replanting or protecting four million trees by 2025, which could capture nearly 600,000 tonnes of CO2.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  had  planted  or protected nearly 3.4 million trees.\n\n## TACKLING PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR OCEANS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is committed to the Plastic Odyssey association, which fights plastic pollution in the seas and oceans through a waste recycling program .\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group has been a partner of this project since 2018 and is continuing its support with a donation of \u20ac50,000 over five years. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is involved in this contribution. The support provided for this expedition forms part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Societal Project.\n\nThis approach is complementary to the 'one contract one tree' operation carried out as part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' insurer activity with Reforest'Action (see section 'Reforestation operation').\n\n1 2",

The preparation and organisation of the work of the Board of Directors are governed by current legislation and regulations, the company's articles of association and the Board of Directors' Rules of Procedure.\n\nOn  21  July  2009,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances adopted Rules of Procedure setting out the operating procedures of the company's Board of Directors, taking into account the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. A directors' Code of Conduct and a process for the succession of corporate officers have been added to the Rules of Procedure.\n\nThe Rules of Procedure set out how the Board's work is organised at Board meetings and meetings held by its specific Committees (Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  Group  Customer  Processes  and  IT Strategic Committee).\n\nThe directors' Code of Conduct appended to the Rules of Procedure constitutes a formal reminder of the legal and regulatory requirements governing the prerogatives and responsibilities associated with a directorship (regular attendance, duty of discretion, protection of the company's interests, prevention of conflicts of interest, right to information, etc.).\n\nSince they were adopted, the Board of Directors has amended the Rules of Procedure (reproduced below) on several occasions.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances decided not to adopt a Code of Corporate Governance (AFEPMEDEF or Middlenext), as some of their provisions do not apply to  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  due  to  it  being  100%  owned  by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., a CAC 40 company. However, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances complies with most of the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The governance rules applied in addition to legal requirements and in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code are described in a table below.\n\n## The C hairman of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nIn  accordance  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Group's  specific  governance model, the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive  Officer  are  separate.  This  is  a  long-term  governance decision.  In  order  to  arrange  for  the  effective  and  optimum running of the company, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has chosen to separate guidance, decision-making and control functions and therefore separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board reiterates this principle each time a Chairman or Chief Executive Officer is appointed or reappointed.",

        "page_content": "At 31 December 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances was chaired by Jos\u00e9 Santucci (appointed on 27 July 2022 to replace Nicolas Denis). The Chief Executive Officer was Philippe Dumont from 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2023 inclusive. Since 4 April 2023 and until 31 December 2023, Executive Management has also had two Deputy Chief Executive Officers: Nicolas Denis and Guillaume Oreckin.\n\nPhilippe Dumont having asserted his pension rights, Nicolas Denis, by decision of the Board of Directors on 2 November 2023, has been Chief Executive Officer of the company since 1 January 2024, with Guillaume Oreckin as his Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  law  and  the  articles  of  association,  the Chairman, appointed by the Board of Directors from among its members,  organises  and  manages  the  Board's  work,  which  he reports to the General Meeting.\n\nThe length of the Chairman's term of office is aligned with that of his term as director. The age limit for the Chairman according to the articles of association is 65. His legal duties include drawing up the agenda for Board meetings and ensuring that information provided to directors is sufficient for them to make an informed judgement. In this Respect, he contributes to the smooth flow of information between the Board and Executive Management and between the Board and its Committees. The Chairman maintains regular direct dialogue with the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, the Secretary General, the heads of key functions and the members of the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. As stated in the Rules of Procedure, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that directors receive the necessary information in advance of each meeting to deliberate with full knowledge of the issues. He encourages and promotes open, critical discussion and ensures that all points of view can be expressed within the Board. He ensures that the responsibilities of the Board are clear to all directors. Following consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors assesses the work carried out and the work still to be carried out, in particular, when the Board's meeting agendas are being set.\n\n## The Board of Directors\n\nThe operation of the Board of Directors is governed by applicable legal requirements, the company's articles of association and its Rules of Procedure.\n\nThe Board of Directors is a collegial body mandated by all of the shareholders. It has a minimum of three members and a maximum of 18  members, subject to the exemptions provided by law. On 31  December  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances consisted of nine directors including the Chairman and two non-voting members. (see composition of the Board as of 31 December 2023, below).\n\nOn the Chairman's recommendation, the Board of Directors can appoint one or more non-voting members. The non-voting member participates in Board meetings but does not have the right to vote. They are consulted on any issue on the Board's agenda. Non-voting members are subject to the same rules as Board members. In this regard, they are considered to be permanent insiders and are subject to the requirements of the Board's Rules of Procedure, particularly in terms of preventing conflicts of interest.\n\nThe term of office of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' directors and nonvoting members is set at three years by the articles of association. This term is renewable, although directors cannot serve for more than four consecutive terms of office. The Board of Directors ensures that directors elected by the General Meeting are reappointed such that, as far as possible, their terms of office end over a balanced period\n\nof time. The main reasons for departure are reaching retirement age, reaching the age limit or holding other offices that means they are no longer able to maintain their directorship.\n\nThe  first  expression  of  the  relationship  between  the  Board  of Directors and Executive Management is constituted by the regular contacts between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, when they are appointed. The Chief Financial Officer and the Secretary General attend all Board meetings. Depending on the subject, the heads of Technical departments may also present to the directors. In accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Code, and in application of its Rules of Procedure, the Board interacts regularly with the four key function managers: 'Risk Management', 'Compliance Verification', 'Actuarial function' and 'Internal Audit'. These latter have regulatory, and if necessary, direct access to the Board of Directors. Their appointment is presented to the Board. In 2023, as every year, the heads of key functions reported very regularly on their activities and results of their assignments before the Board and its Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, staff representatives from the executive and non-executive colleges of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions, a service provider subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group, are invited to attend Board meetings twice a year.\n\n## Conflict of interest policy\n\nThe members of the Board are subject to the legal obligations and regulations applicable to conflicts of interest. Each director of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, as well as the non-voting members adhere to the Group's values and commitments described in its Ethics Charter and Code of Conduct. The latter constitutes the basis of ethical and  professional  conduct  applicable  to  directors,  managers  and employees of the Group. Furthermore, the functioning of the Board is governed by its Rules of Procedure and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances directors' Code of Conduct which affirm that in the event of conflicts of interest, in which it could be involved directly or indirectly, the director must inform the Board. The director must abstain from deliberating and voting on any resolution tending to authorise any transaction whatsoever in which he (or the company he represents) has a direct interest or indirectly.\n\nBoard meetings are convened by the Chairman as often as required by the company's interests and, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, at least four times a year.\n\n## Assessment by the board of its operation\n\nPeriodic assessment by the Board of its operation is part of good governance. A questionnaire has been sent out each year since 2018.\n\nThe Board of Directors assessed its operation in respect of the 2023 financial year. This assessment shows that the directors are satisfied with the operation, composition and activity of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Compensation paid to directors\n\nThe directors, the Chairman and the non-voting members receive, in respect of their functions, the sole compensation provided for attendance at the meetings of the Board and/or Committees.

It strives to promote long-term value creation taking into account the social and  environmental  impact  of  its  operations.

The Board of Directors may delegate this hearing to the Audit and Risk Committee. Heads of key functions may, directly and on their own initiative, inform the Board of Directors when events occur in order to justify a hearing.\n\n## Limitations that the Board of Directors may place on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer and, if applicable, on the Deputy Chief Executive Officers\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer has the widest powers to act in the name of the company in all circumstances and to represent the company in its dealings with third parties.

If the company does not have a policy of this kind, the reasons for this must be explained.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances was made up of nine directors and one non-voting member. In accordance with its policy, it is both balanced and diverse in terms of age, qualifications and professional experience and gender balance.

The Board of Directors is formed seeking balanced representation of women and men. The proportion of directors of each gender cannot be less than 40% at the close of the next General Meeting to approve appointments for companies that, for the third financial year in a row, employ an average of at least two hundred and fifty permanent employees and generate net revenues or have a total balance sheet of at least \u20ac50 million.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nAlthough Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has no employees, its Board of Directors has five women and four men out of nine members, i.e. a proportion of 56% women.

The Board has to make sure that important issues are suitably prepared and debated. It has to measure the actual contribution of each director to its work. It is recommended that the Board organise once a year a discussion on how it operates, carry out a formal assessment every three years with the assistance of an external consultant, and inform shareholders.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nSee above section 'Operation of the Board of Directors - Assessment by the Board of its operation'.\n\n## Number of Board meetings\n\n## French Commercial Code:\n\nThe frequency of meetings is not regulated. Only one meeting per year is compulsory, to approve the financial statements.\n\n## AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code - 2022:\n\n(Recommendation 12). The frequency of meetings shall allow for an in-depth review of the matters addressed.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nBoard meetings are convened by the Chairman as often as required by the company's interests and at least four times a year.

See 'Activity of the Board of Directors' above.\n\n## Videoconferencing\n\nFrench Commercial Code:\n\nThis is permitted by law.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nDirectors who cannot physically attend a Board meeting may inform the Chairman of their intention to participate by videoconference or other means of telecommunication allowing for them to be identified by the other members and the proceedings to be faithfully transmitted. (...) Participation may also be refused for technical reasons by the Chairman. (Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors).

In addition, it is expected that all directors have the requisite qualities and, in particular, that they are honest, present, active and involved.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nDirectors receive compensation for attending Board meetings (formerly called directors' fees). Each year, the total budget for this remuneration is set by the General Meeting and the allocation is determined by the Board of Directors. In the event of a director's repeated absence disrupting the functioning of the Board, the Chairman may ask the director to offer their resignation (see Rules of Procedure). The Board held seven meetings in 2023. The average attendance rate for the year was 92%. See 'Compensation paid to directors' above.\n\n## Right to be personally informed\n\n## French Commercial Code:\n\n(L. 225-35 para. 3). The Chairman or Chief Executive Officer is required to provide each director with all of the documents and information required to perform their duties.

The Rules of Procedure must state how this right to disclosure is exercised and the related confidentiality obligations: requirement to provide all relevant information, even critical, at any time in the company's life between Board meetings if an emergency or important matter so requires, importance of providing directors with information if they do not have sufficient knowledge of the company's organisation and activity.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors organises the Board's work and ensures that it operates smoothly. He convenes Board meetings, sets the agenda for meetings and ensures that directors receive necessary and sufficient information in advance, so that decisions can be made with full knowledge of the facts. The Chairman alone is authorised to ask Executive Management for documents and information about the company outside Board meetings. Directors also have this option subject to having informed the Chairman (Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors).\n\n## Training of directors\n\n## AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code - 2022:\n\n(Recommendation 14). If they consider it necessary, each director benefits from additional training on matters specific to the company, its business lines, its business sector and the issues it faces in terms of corporate social responsibility, particularly in relation to climate.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances governance:\n\nEach year, directors benefit from a training programme devised on the basis of the results of the annual assessment of the Board's overall competence and the wishes expressed by directors each year.\n\n## Term of office of directors\n\n## French Commercial Code:\n\n(L. 225-18 para. 1). The term of office of directors is set by the articles of association and may not exceed six years.\n\n## AFEP-MEDEF Governance Code - 2022:\n\n(Recommendation 15).

Two non-voting members also take part in Board meetings.\n\nEach year, the Board considers the desirable balance of its members and, in particular, its diversity (representation of men and women, age, qualifications, professional experience, etc.).\n\nThe Board is composed  of five women and four men, with women therefore making up more than 44% of members.\n\nThe average age of directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances as at 31 December 2023 was 56. The company's articles of association provide for an age limit of 65. If a director were to exceed this age limit, he or she would be automatically deemed to have resigned at the end of the next General Meeting.\n\nMembers' qualifications and experience vary and are complementary (see Biographies below).\n\nThe Board's overall competence is evaluated on the basis of an individual assessment of each member. Directors must collectively have the necessary knowledge and experience with regard to the insurance markets and the financial markets, the company's strategy and business model, its governance system, financial and actuarial analysis and legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to insurance undertakings, as well as the societal and environmental fields.\n\nA director's skills are assessed in relation to their role: member or Chairman of the Board or of the Audit and Risk Committee. This takes account of experience acquired during their working life in Respect of offices held or through training courses taken in the course of their career.\n\nIn accordance with the 'Competence and Good Repute' policy, approved and reviewed annually by the Board, a questionnaire is sent to each member enabling them to assess themselves on the six themes (Insurance market and financial markets, company strategy and its business model, Corporate Governance System, Financial and Actuarial Analysis, Legislative and Regulatory Requirements, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and thus express a request for training in these areas. The results of all questionnaires are also used to assess the Board's overall competence.\n\nIn accordance with the results of the assessment of the Board's collective competence and the wishes expressed by the directors at the end of 2022, six training sessions were provided during 2023 on  the  following  topics:  1)  Regulatory  overview  of  climate  risk; 2) Advanced IFRS 17; 3) Regulatory compliance news; 4) ORSA Financial risks; 5) Data management - Point to date; 6) IT and Cybersecurity risks - Regulatory news.\n\nIf they consider it necessary, each director benefits from training on matters specific to the company, its methods, its business sector and the issues it faces in terms of corporate social responsibility.\n\nAs it is part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group, and in its capacity as head of an insurance Group whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is composed of one independent director and for the other directors, 50% composed of Regional Banks executives (four directors) and 50% Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Management (four directors).\n\nIts non-voting members are the Chief Executive Officer of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Customer and Development division. The Board does not have a lead director.\n\nAlthough as at 31 December 2023, with its subsidiaries in France and  abroad,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  had  6,251  employees (including 5,498 in France), its Board does not include any directors representing employees, as its parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., fulfils this requirement.\n\nThe Board also does not have a director representing employee shareholders. None of the employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group holds shares in the company. The directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are also not shareholders of the company. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' articles of association do not require directors to hold a minimum number of shares in the company.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Board  of  Directors  includes  one independent  director.  Their  appointment  was  based  on  an assessment of several criteria: expertise in insurance, no conflicts of interest, respect for the principle of gender equality and diversity, respect for the age limit, availability, involvement, adaptation to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group's culture. The independence criteria used by the Board were as follows:\n\n- z not to have any relationship whatsoever with the company, its Group or its management that could compromise the exercise of their freedom of judgement;\n- z not to be or not have been during the previous five years: an employee, Chief Executive Officer, director of the company, of a subsidiary, or of the parent company;\n- z not to be a corporate executive officer of a company in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is a director;\n- z not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker, commercial banker or consultant that is significant to the company or its Group;\n- z not to be related by close family ties to a company officer;\n- z not to have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years.\n\nThe  status  of  independent  director  is  lost  after  12  years.  An independent director cannot receive variable compensation linked to the performance of the company or Group.\n\n## Movements within the Board and renewals of mandates during the 2023 financial year\n\nOn 7 February 2023, the Board of Directors co-opted with effect from 1 March 2023 Catherine Galvez to replace Nicolas Denis, who resigned.\n\nOn 2 May 2023, the General Meeting renewed the terms of office of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Grivet, Clotilde L'Angevin and Olivier Gavalda then ratified those of Olivier Gavalda and Catherine Galvez.\n\nOn 27 July 2023, the Board of Directors co-opted C\u00e9cile Mouton to replace Clotilde L'Angevin, who resigned.\n\nOn 2 November 2023, the Board of Directors appointed G\u00e9rald Gr\u00e9goire as non-voting member.",

Group has been pursuing its policy of gender diversity  for  several  years,  in  particular  through  successive agreements, with the aim of accelerating the feminisation of the highest management bodies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group entities. Within the framework of the 'Law aimed at accelerating economic and professional equality', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances shares two indicators each year assessing the representation of women among managers and in the governing bodies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions. This law, which aims to actively promote the presence of women in positions of responsibility, commits to a representation of 30% of women among senior executives and in governing bodies no later than 1 March 2026, and 40% no later than 1 March 2029.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, a corporate entity, does not have any employees. In the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, approximately 70% of employees are employees of two French entities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances  Solutions  and  Sirca,  providing  services  for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances subsidiaries (financial, commercial, legal, management, etc.). The male/female representation of these two companies was as of 31 December 2023:\n\n- z representation of senior executives: 82.9% men and 17.1% women at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions; Absence of senior executives at Sirca;\n- z representation of senior management: 77.6% men and 23.3% women at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions and 72.1% men and 27.9% women at Sirca.\n\n## Agreements entered into between a corporate officer or a significant shareholder and a subsidiary - Agreements governed by Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code\n\nNo agreements that fall within the scope of Article L. 225-37-4, point 2, of the French Commercial Code were entered into in 2022. With the exception of agreements involving transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business on an arm's length basis, this article covers agreements entered into between (i) a corporate officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances (Chief Executive Officer or director) or a shareholder holding more than 10% of the company's voting rights ( i.e. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.), and (ii) a company controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nAgreements that fall within the scope of Article  L.  225-38 of the French Commercial Code (related-party agreements) entered into by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and one of its corporate officers or shareholders or a company that shares a common director with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, are subject to special oversight due to potential conflicts of interest. Since the creation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, only one agreement falls within the scope of this article. This agreement, signed between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, on the one hand, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A., on the other hand, was authorised by the Board of Directors on 27 July 2023 and concerns the VAT Group.\n\n## Terms and conditions of shareholders' participation in General Meetings\n\nThe terms and conditions of shareholders' participation in General Meetings are laid down in Article  18 of the company's articles of association.\n\nAt  31  December  2023,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  had  two shareholders: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for all the shares except one share held by the simplified joint-stock company Sigma Investissement 39, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

        "page_content": "## 3.3  COMPENSATION POLICY\n\n## 3.3.1 COMPENSATION POLICY OF CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES\n\n## General principles applicable to all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances employees\n\nAs subsidiaries of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group, the entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances share, in their own compensation policy, the principles of fairness, transparency and utility that have contributed to building its success and its reputation.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. has established a responsible compensation policy which frames risk taking and is aimed at reflecting the values of the Group and respecting the interests of all stakeholders, be they employees, customers or shareholders. Its goals consist in:\n\n- z attracting, motivating and retaining the talents the Group needs;\n- z recognising individual and collective performance over time;\n- z aligning the interests of employees with those of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its shareholders;\n- z promoting sound and effective risk management; and\n- z applying a neutral compensation policy from the point of view of gender.\n\nIn accordance with the EBA Guidelines on compensation policy (GL/ EBA/2021/04), the compensation policy and its practice are based on the principle of equal pay for men and women workers for the same job or work of same value.\n\nIn line with the specific characteristics of its business lines, legal entities and legislation in local markets, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's compensation system aims at offering competitive compensation relative to its benchmark markets to attract and retain the best talent. Compensation is dependent on individual performance, but also the overall performance of the business lines.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  thus developed in accordance with the objectives defined by the Group while endeavouring to adapt them to the different categories of employees and the Insurance regulatory corpus defined in particular by laws applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies which come under the 'Solvency II' system in accordance with Delegated Regulation  2015/35  of  10  October  2014.  It  also  includes  the provisions of the Volcker Rule, the Banking Separation Law and Finance,  the  Insurance  Distribution  Directive  and  the  European regulation Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on the consideration and integration of risks in terms of durability.\n\nTotal compensation paid to employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances comprises the following elements:\n\n- z basis  salary;\n- z individual variable compensation;\n- z collective variable compensation;\n- z long-term variable and deferred compensation;\n- z peripheral compensation (supplementary pension and health insurance schemes).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances compares its practices with those of its market (mutual insurance, insurance, and bancassurance companies)\n\nand thus seeks to position the overall compensation of its employees around the median market practice.\n\n## Base   salary\n\nThe base  salary rewards employees for the skills required to exercise the responsibilities associated with their position.\n\nA  position  (and  by  extension  the  associated  function)  are characterised by a particular role and contributions, a grade within the  organisation  and  a  job  description  outlining  the  expected competencies and experience.\n\n## Individual variable compensation\n\nIndividual variable compensation rewards employee performance and is an integral part of the annual compensation structure.\n\nThe base  salary and variable compensation are calculated to allow a fully flexible variable compensation policy, with the possibility of non-payment of individual variable compensation in the event of under-performance and/or reported and proven risk behaviours.\n\nFurthermore, variable compensation is set in such a way that it does not impede the ability of Group entities to increase their solvency when necessary.\n\nIndividual variable compensation is assessed by precise measurement of the results obtained relative to specific annual objectives (how much), taking into account the conditions in which the objectives were achieved (how).\n\nThe extent to which objectives are achieved or exceeded is the key criterion for the allocation of individual variable compensation, in addition to a qualitative evaluation focusing on how the targets were achieved (examining criteria such as autonomy, involvement, uncertainty, general context, etc.), and in light of consequences for other stakeholders in the company (managers, colleagues, other sectors, etc.).\n\nTaking these various aspects into account helps to differentiate between individual performance levels.\n\nIn response to regulatory requirements both in Europe (Solvency II, Directive  on  insurance  distribution)  and  the  United  States  (the Volcker Rule), a code of conduct is included in the compensation policy so that compensation practices:\n\n- z do not create incentives that might encourage the persons concerned to promote their own interests to the potential detriment of their client;\n- z do not hinder the ability of their employees to act in the best interests of their clients, or dissuade them from presenting information in an unbiased, clear and non-misleading way;\n- z do not encourage speculative trading positions to be taken, where proprietary trading is permitted by law;\n- z prohibit employees from any recourse to an individual hedging strategy or income protection or liability insurance that could compromise the risk alignment envisaged by variable compensation schemes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements under Solvency II, to prevent any conflict of interest, the compensation of personnel occupying 'key' functions will be set independently of that of the business lines they oversee or audit. These include functions such as those defined by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014, namely Risk Management, Compliance, Internal Audit and Actuarial functions.\n\nThe targets set for them and the indicators used to determine their variable compensation do not take into account criteria relating to the results and financial performance of the entities they control.\n\nThese targets can be economic and/or non-economic:\n\n- z economic targets are disconnected with the results of the controlled entity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, and based on the results of the immediately upper entity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.;\n- z non-economic targets are set up with respect to the SMART method (Specific, Measurable, Accessible, Realistic and Time-limited). These targets can for instance focus on the quality/reliability of the control procedures under their responsibility.\n\nGuaranteed  compensation  is  only  authorised  in  the  context of recruitment and for a period not exceeding one year. In the context of the recruitment of employees benefiting from deferred and unvested compensation in the company they have just left, a practice of 'buyback of deferred variable compensation' is possible.\n\n## Collective variable compensation\n\nCollective variable compensation rewards the collective performance of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances.  It  consists  of  profit-sharing  and incentive plans.\n\nCollective variable compensation is supplemented by a company savings scheme and a collective pension savings plan for the benefit of all employees.\n\n## Employee share ownership to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s equity\n\nIn 2023, in order to bring employees into the capital of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.,  it  carried  out  a  capital  increase  reserved  for  the employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group with a discount offered on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. share price of 20%.\n\n## Compensation policy for executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has implemented the Credit Agricole S.A. compensation policy for executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group.\n\nThese managers, members  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances management team, are identified and named according to the rules laid down and defined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.: they then join the management pools established by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group.\n\nThe  variable  compensation  policy  put  in  place  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group's senior executives aims to compensate, on the one hand, the annual performance based on the scope of responsibility of each executive, and on the other hand, the long-term performance of the entity and the Group by considering sustainable economic performance, consideration of its societal impact and the alignment of the interests of managers and shareholders.\n\n## Individual variable compensation\n\nAmong individual variable compensation mechanisms, the executive managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are eligible for a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  Group  variable  compensation  scheme:  individual variable compensation, based on the achievement of pre-defined individual  and  collective  targets  within  an  employee's  area  of responsibility.\n\nThis  programme  has  been  designed  and  adapted  for  senior executives,  who  are  not  executive  managers,  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances who also receive individual variable compensation.\n\nThe  calculation  of  individual  variable  compensation  measures individual performance, on the basis of the attainment of individual and collective targets in four areas specified below.\n\nThese areas are weighed according to the level of responsibility of the executive manager or senior executive:\n\n- z economic results are weighted by 20% to 50% of the total individual variable compensation, the weight increasing with the level of responsibility;\n- z the remaining 50% to 80% are split according to non-economic performance indicators.\n\n## ECONOMIC RESULTS\n\nThe creation of shareholder value is assessed according to the nature of the function concerned. It must cross-reference financial results as well as levels of investment and risks generated, the cost of capital and liquidity, in harmony with the development strategy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group and its businesses.\n\n## NON-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nNon-economic performance indicators are linked with the Group's Client, Human and Societal projects, and measure the following creation of value:\n\n- z client: satisfaction with services and advice provided, adaptation of offers for new uses, innovation;\n- z human: ability to attract, develop and retain employees, to initiate the managerial transformation enabling a framework of enhanced confidence;\n- z societal: mutual and societal commitment, respect for values beyond legal obligations, development of green finance.\n\nThe variable compensation awarded is also directly impacted by the observation of non-respectful behaviour good repute requirements, compliance rules and procedures and risk limits.\n\nThe levels of annual variable compensation are defined in percentage of the base salary and are increasing according to the level of manager's responsibility.\n\nEach senior executive, regardless of their profession or function, has a part of its economic objectives based on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group criteria, this share depending on its level of responsibility, the other part being based on the economic objectives of its entity.\n\n## Long term variable compensation\n\nThe long-term compensation plan set up by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole   S.A. Group takes the form of a share award and/or cash scheme indexed to long-term performance conditions.\n\nThe allocations are annual and decided based on a proposal by the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. for each executive manager  according  to  their  performance  and  potential  and  by the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  for key personnel and high-potential employees.",

        "page_content": "The objectives of the long-term incentive plan are multiple:\n\n- z to strengthen the link between sustainable performance and compensation;\n- z to adapt compensation structures, in line with regulations, by allowing compensation to be managed over both the short and long term;\n- z to align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders and the Group's long-term performance;\n- z to strengthen the Group's attractiveness and its ability to retain its talents; and\n- z to enable the company's value creation to be shared with key employees.\n\nSubject to the fulfilment of the performance conditions, the shares and/or indexed cash are vested annually in equal proportions over a three-year vesting period.\n\nAfter vesting, an additional holding requirement may subsequently be imposed on beneficiaries.\n\nAt the end of the deferred period, the vesting of the shares and/ or of the indexed cash is linked to the fulfilment of strict long-term performance conditions, on the basis of criteria linked to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group's economic, financial and societal performance.\n\nThese performance criteria are set when each plan is implemented.\n\n## Supplementary pension schemes\n\nFrom  2011  to  2019,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances'  supplementary pension plan for executive managers consisted of a combination of defined contribution pension plans and a top-up defined benefit plan:\n\n- z the aggregate contributions of the two defined-contribution supplementary  pension  plans  (the  branch  scheme  and  the company scheme) are equal to 8% of the gross salary capped at eight times the Social Security ceiling (of which 5% is paid by the employer and 3% by the beneficiary);\n- z the rights to the defined-benefit top-up scheme, which are determined after the rights paid under the defined-contribution plans. These rights are equal, subject to presence at term, to the product of a pension rate between 0.125% and 0.30% per quarter of seniority, within the limit of 120 quarters, and the reference compensation.\n\nThis  defined-benefit  supplementary  pension  plan  complies  with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code as well as with the former provisions of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code which, for the periods concerned, limited the vesting rate of defined-benefit plans to 3% per year (law repealed by Ordinance No. 2019-1234 of 27 November 2019).\n\nIn all cases, at the settlement date, the total retirement annuity of all schemes is capped at 70% of the reference compensation by application of the supplementary pension scheme regulations for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' executive managers.\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  PACTE  law  and  in  accordance  with  the provisions of Ordinance No.  2019-697 of 3 July 2019, the top-up defined-benefit plan has been definitively closed since 4 July 2019 and the conditional rights it provides have been crystallised as of 31 December 2019.\n\nEntitlements accumulated within the Group prior to the effective date of the 2011 regulation are maintained in accordance with the provisions of the regulation and are accumulated, where applicable, with entitlements arising from the application of the regulation in force for the calculation of the ceiling of the pension paid.\n\nTherefore, no additional entitlements under the top-up definedbenefit pension plan will be granted for periods of employment after 1 January 2020. The entitlements for periods of employment prior to 1 January 2020 will continue to be calculated on the basis of the salary at the end of the career, in accordance with the conditions provided for by the plan, and the benefit of these past entitlements remains uncertain and subject to the condition of presence.\n\nAs of 1 January 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has deployed a new pension savings scheme implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. enabling the gradual building of savings with the Company's support. This system consists of an Article 82 defined contribution plan and free share allocations. Part of this capital will thus evolve according to the Group's performance, thus reinforcing the alignment with the objectives of strong and sustainable growth of the Group's corporate strategy.\n\n## Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is appointed free of charge. Their compensation is provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. in accordance with the provisions applicable within the  Group.  He  is  not  entitled  to  any  benefits,  specific  pension arrangements, death and disability insurance or severance benefits of any kind in respect of his office.\n\nHowever, they are considered 'identified staff' (as defined under the heading 'Reward policy' of the Universal Registration Document of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) and their compensation is structured in such a way as to be aligned to the long-term interests of the company.\n\nThus, and in accordance with regulatory obligations, strict rules apply to the compensation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' Chief Executive Officer, in particular through a compensation policy that encourages sound and effective risk management, a variable compensation that is partly deferred and paid in the form of instruments, and which may be adjusted according to risks (malus and/or clawback clause).\n\nThis annual variable compensation is also determined on the basis of economic and non-economic objectives measuring the creation of managerial, social and customer value.\n\nThe offices of Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances are exercised against payment or free of charge. In both cases, their compensation is set in accordance with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. executive compensation policy implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nDeputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  are  therefore  subject  to  the compensation  policy  for  executive  managers  presented  in  this document and are 'identified staff' as defined below ('Compensation of identified personnel').\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group.\n\nAccordingly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has established a Committee to implement compensation policies; this Committee gathers the Risk Management and Permanent Control department, the Compliance department and the Human Resources department.\n\nThe role of this Committee, that allows to involve control functions in the process of variable compensations review and more precisely the ones relative to identified staff, is to:\n\n- z define identification criteria for employees considered to be 'risktakers', in a consistent manner within the framework given by the Group for each period, and the regulatory requirements specific to insurance;\n- z identify and update the list of identified staff;\n- z coordinate the effective implementation of risk-behaviour control, in accordance with the applicable procedures and norms;\n- z validate the review of the process and the reporting to the Group governance bodies, including the information relative to individual risk-behaviour situations observed.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' compensation policy, which is drawn up on the recommendation of the Human Resources department, is regularly adjusted on the basis of the Committee's work, assessments and recommendations, as well as any changes in regulations, the\n\nrecommendations of Internal Audit or of the ACPR and changes in the Group's compensation policy.\n\nSince 5 November 2013, the date on which the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances decided to transfer the duties of the Compensation Committee to that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A., the compensation  policy  has  been  placed  under  the  control  of  the Compensation Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Group. Therefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group, through the Human Resources department, provides this Committee with all the information it needs to carry out its duties.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  is  then informed each year of the work carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Compensation Committee, in particular:\n\n- z through the issuance of opinions relating to the compensation policy, its updates and the various related application notes;\n- z on its position regarding the variable compensation package in relation to the financial situation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, its long-term performance and its compliance with the risk policy;\n- z on the completion of a census of identified staff;\n- z on the review of the opinion of the control functions on the implementation and control of the compensation policy.\n\nThis work enables the Board of Directors to review and approve the compensation policy.\n\nFinally, the Group Control and Audit function ensures, through its audits, compliance with the policy and conformity of practices.\n\n## 3.3.2 COMPENSATION OF IDENTIFIED STAFF\n\nThe determination of employees as identified staff is the result of a joint process that involves the Risk Management and Permanent Control department, the Compliance department and the Human Resources department. This process is under the supervision of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. Compensation Committee.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2015/35  of  10 October 2014, the employees considered to be 'identified staff' include the employees that belong to a category of staff that could have an impact on the risk profile, because of the functions they carry out, namely:\n\n- z corporate officers and executive directors;\n- z members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Executive Committee;\n- z staff holding 'key' positions specified in Articles 269 to 272 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35: Risks management, Compliance control, Internal audit, Actuarial function;\n- z the staff responsible for the underwriting activity and the business development;\n- z the staff responsible for investments.\n\nFor each new financial year, the list or categories of employees identified are presented to the Compensation Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on the recommendation of the executive management of each entity, after validation by the Risk, Compliance and Human Resources functions.\n\nThe compensation policy of identified staff is specific in terms of variable compensation, 40% of this compensation (60% for the highest compensations) being deferred over three years, subject to performance conditions:\n\n- z the deferred share is acquired in one-third tranches: one third during the year N+1, one third during the year N+2 and one third\n\nduring the year N+3, N being the reference year, provided that the acquisitions conditions are fulfilled (performance conditions);\n\n- z the performance conditions are in line with the ones of the longterm variable compensation, defined in the chapter 'Long-term variable compensation' above;\n- z the deferred variable compensation is paid in cash backed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. share;\n- z the employees involved in this scheme are prohibited from implementing a hedging or insurance strategy (whether on a personal basis or through their employer) with a view to limiting the scope of the statements contained in the compensation system in order to align a portion of the variable compensation with risks taken;\n- z the total amount of variable compensation attributed to an employee being identified staff can entirely or partially be reduced in function of the actions or risk behaviour observed;\n- z in case of proven risky behaviour or particularly serious acts, subject to applicable local laws, the return of all or part of the variable compensation already paid could be demanded, up to five years after the payment;\n- z the staff whose variable compensation is below \u20ac120,000 is excluded from the scope for the application of these rules relative to deferred compensation.\n\nThe compensation paid during the financial year identified staff is  the  subject  of  a  resolution  that  is  submitted  annually  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s General Meeting.",

They held up better than expected to still high inflation, violent monetary tightening and a disappointing Chinese recovery. They also continued to evolve in an international context marked by major uncertainties, particularly geopolitical, such as the continuation of the war in Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Palestinian conflict in October.\n\nIn  the United  States in  addition  to  the  more  substantial-thanexpected support provided by abundant savings and the stimulus linked  to  President  Biden's  industrial  policy,  the  main  factor  of resilience was less sensitivity to the rise in interest rates. While growth continued to slow during the first half of the year (with annualised quarterly variations down to 2.1%), the second half of the year confirmed unexpected robustness with respect to monetary tightening. Thanks to the rebound in the second and third quarters (4.9% then 3.3% at an annualised quarterly rate), average growth stood at 2.5% in 2023 (compared to 1.9% in 2022). This good result is explained by the resilience of the consumption of services and goods (which provide, respectively, around one and a half points of growth), justified by the sustained increase in real disposable income (4.2% on average) and the slight decrease in the savings rate (down to 4% in the last quarter). Growth was also supported by public spending and net external demand (respectively contributing nearly 0.7 and 0.6 points of growth) although private investment and inventories weighed on growth (subtracting 0.2 and 0.3 points respectively). The decline in total inflation continued, (3.4% ov er 12 months in December 2023; 6.5% a year ago) helped by the drop\n\nin energy prices and the easing of food prices despite the more limited decline in core inflation (3.9% over 12 months in December 2023, 5.7% a year earlier). The change in the 'Personal Consumption Expenditure' index, a benchmark which is monitored by the Federal Reserve (1) confirmed disinflation, despite more stubborn underlying inflation.\n\nIn the Euro zone , after being strongly penalised in 2022 by the increase in gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine, inflation has largely benefited from the fall in energy prices as well food prices. Total inflation thus fell significantly (from 9.2% in December 2022 to 2.9% in December 2023) while core inflation (excluding energy and  unprocessed  food)  remained  more  dynamic  (an  increase of 3.9% in December 2023 compared to 6.9% a year earlier). In December, the largest contribution to the annual inflation rate came from  services  (around  +1.7  percentage  point,  pp)  while  energy contributed negatively to inflation (around -0.7 pp). Penalised by high inflation, household consumption initially weighed on growth before recovering in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, negligible contributions from investment and net external demand, on the one hand, and negative contributions from inventories, on the other hand, eclipsed the positive contribution from household consumption. GDP therefore fell by 0.1% during the quarter but remained stable year-on-year. This annual stagnation is the result of the difficulties in Germany (-0.4% year-on-year) which contrasts with the moderate increase in Italy (0.1%), more marked in France (0.6%). and especially in Spain (1.8%). After a stagnating fourth quarter, the average growth rate in the Euro zone stood at 0.5% in 2023. As for France, annual growth was 0.9% in 2023.\n\nIn a context of robust activity in the United States and less depressed than  transferred  in  the  Euro  zone,  resilient  labour  markets  and inflation still far from the 2% targets, central banks remained very vigilant. After falling mechanically thanks to the favourable base",

        "page_content": "effects of energy and food prices, disinflation has slowed, raising fears of the triggering of price-wage loops and more marked and lasting second-round effects. The resolve of the Federal Reserve and the ECB in their fight against inflation was therefore strengthened. After raising the target range for the rate of fed funds from 425 basis points in 2022 to (4.25%; 4.50%), the Federal Reserve maintained its  monetary  tightening,  however,  less  aggressively  (100  basis points, bringing the upper limit of the range to 5.50% in July 2023). It also continued the quantitative tightening initiated in June 2022 (no reinvestment of securities held and reaching maturity). After increasing its key rates by 250 basis points in 2022, the ECB also continued its monetary tightening with increases totalling 200 basis points, bringing the refinancing and deposit rates to 4.50% and 4% respectively  from  September  2023.  After  expanding  its  balance sheet  (targeted  long-term  refinancing  operations,  TLTRO,  asset purchase program, APP, then emergency pandemic program, PEPP), the ECB continued its quantitative tightening (end of net purchases of  securities,  repayments  of  TLTROs)  with  the  expectation,  all other things being equal, of absorbing excess liquidity by 2029. However, the ECB decided to maintain the reinvestment of the PEPP maturities in the first half of 2024, i.e. a little longer than expected, before gradually reducing them before ending it at the end of 2024.\n\n2023 can be very schematically divided into three parts regarding the bond markets . Markets began 2023 with an overly optimistic scenario  assuming  a  sharp  and  lasting  rebound  in  the  Chinese economy, a rapid normalisation of inflation and the imminent end of monetary tightening. Bond tensions (2-year and 10-year swap rates) thus eased overall despite a violent upheaval in March due to the disruptions affecting the US banking system (bankruptcies of three\n\nUS Regional Banks, particularly exposed to new technologies and real estate). However, because of the resilience of inflation, the rise in the price of oil (OPEC's decision to reduce its production) and the continuation of monetary tightening, market expectations were disappointed and interest rates were again on an upward trajectory until central banks opted for the monetary status quo in September. The hope of finally reaching an end to tightening, or even a rapid easing, encouraged a downward movement in interest rates.\n\nDespite their fall at the end of the year, US rates (Treasuries) at two years (4.25% at the end of December 2023) and 10 years (3.90%) increased significantly in 2023: to 4.60% and 3.95%, respectively, the average rates recorded increases of 160 and 100 basis points, accentuating the inversion of the curve over the full year. There was also a very large increase in European sovereign rates. German 2-year and 10-year yields averaged 2.90% and 2.45% respectively (up 215 and 130 basis points). At the end of the year, the Bund reached around 2%, a fall of nearly 40 basis points year-on-year. During the year, while the spread offered by France stabilised at around 50 basis points above the Bund, those of Italy and Spain (respectively 95 and 170 basis points compared to the Bund) contracted.\n\nDriven by more resilient growth and falling inflation, eclipsing a troubled international context and deferred monetary easing, the equity markets performed outstandingly. Betting on a soft landing, risk appetite was maintained overall despite a tense and uncertain geopolitical climate, which is borne out by the average increases in the indices (S&P 500 +24%, Eurostoxx 50 +17%, CAC 40 +14%). Finally, the euro appreciated very slightly on average (+3%) against the dollar, which itself appreciated against the yen (+7%) and the yuan (+5%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Without collapsing, but without inflation reducing quickly either. Uncertainty remains high, due in particular to the conflicts in Ukraine and  the  Middle  East,  and  downside  risks  weigh  on  our  growth scenario.\n\nIn the United States, although aggressive monetary tightening is acting with a relatively long delay (which has been underestimated), it is not painless, its effects simply diffuse more slowly and more durably.  With  growth  still  positive  but  below  its  potential  rate, the US economy should remain afloat until mid-2024, before the impact of rising interest rates takes a more significant toll through debt refinancing. Our central scenario is based on a recession, at the junction of 2024 and 2025, but only slight because the financial situation of companies and, above all, households is healthy. They should also benefit from an 'unbalanced' labour market favouring supply and whose cooling would result in a slight increase in the unemployment  rate.  They  will  benefit  from  the  fall  in  inflation, which, even if the increase in the price of services proves to be persistent, should fall below the 3% mark in the second quarter of 2024. Our scenario assumes total inflation at 2.4% and core inflation at 2.7% at the end of 2024, and will remain close to these levels throughout 2025. In terms of average growth, our scenario assumes a significant slowdown in 2024 (to 1.6% after 2.5% in 2023) followed by a further decline in 2025 (to only 0.5% in 2025) despite the acceleration expected at the end of the period thanks to the fall in interest rates.\n\nIn the Euro zone, the slowdown is certainly marked, but is cushioned by the disinflationary process, enabling the scenario of a smooth landing on a deteriorated growth trend to be anticipated. Negative factors (higher real interest rates, structural competitiveness shock linked to energy, a very uncertain external environment) are driving the Euro zone economy at a lower weakened potential growth rate compared to the pre-pandemic period. But some of the positive factors that allowed European growth to weaken without collapsing, despite falling but still high inflation and a powerful transmission of monetary tightening, will still be at work in 2024. This above all concerns employment and wages, which are resisting to the detriment of productivity and unit labour costs.\n\nWith a transmission delay of twelve to eighteen months after the last  hike  in  rates  in  September  2023,  the  roll-out  of  monetary transmission will continue in 2024, reducing the pace of increase in total investment: it should remain positive (0.9% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025), but well below the 2014-2019 average. The recovery in domestic demand will be driven mainly by the recovery in private consumption (1.1% in 2024 and 1.3% in 2025). The increase in the unemployment rate, low and temporary (6.7% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025, after 6.6% in 2023), will not derail this rebound based on an increase in the wage bill and of its related purchasing power. Households will also be able to rely on significant cumulative savings, which  will  no  longer  be  precautionary,  once  the  disinflationary\n\ndynamic  contributes  to  improving  confidence.  However,  the budgetary stance is becoming more restrictive, definitively removing all subsidies (Covid and energy) from 2024.\n\nGrowth should therefore stand at 0.7% in 2024 before recovering to 1.4% in 2025. Total average inflation (year-on-year) should reach 2.8% and 2.5% in 2024 and 2025 respectively. This very 'sluggish' growth scenario is based on a recovery in household consumption, which itself is estimated by less dynamic but still positive job creation, sustained wage growth, and the continued slow pace of disinflation and, ultimately, an improvement in confidence, suggesting a decline in precautionary savings. This scenario is nevertheless surrounded by downside risks: the 'switch' to a recession scenario does not require an external shock, but a simple deviation from the favourable assumptions  on  which  our  central  scenario  is  based  (continued disinflation, easing of financing conditions, maintenance of activity and employment, gains in the purchasing power of wages).\n\nAs  for  France,  the  scenario  uses  a  'story'  whose  elements  are essentially those of the scenario drawn for the Euro zone: continued recovery in consumption in 2024 which will remain robust in 2025 (decline in inflation, dynamic wages, slight decrease in the savings rate), modest decline in corporate investment before its recovery on the occasion of the easing of financial conditions (end of 2024 then 2025, slightly positive contribution from net external demand). After 0.9% in 2023, growth should reach 1% and 1.3% respectively in 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn China, one year after the abrupt abandonment of zero-Covid, growth  remains  'weighed  down'  by  structural  problems  and support policies are failing to instil the confidence necessary for stabilisation and then for recovery. The Chinese economy is running at its potential pace and remains marked by a chronic shortfall in domestic demand, which is reflected by the absence of inflation: deflation and serious real estate crisis, but also the aging population, accumulation of precautionary savings and high internal debt which is reminiscent of Japan at the end of the 1980s and its 'lost decade'. The 2024 growth target should be officially announced in March during the parliamentary sessions: it should be between 4.5% and 5%. It seems more likely that the government will favour a more cautious and conservative approach with a target of around 4.5%, so as not to take the political risk of 'missing out'. Our 2024 forecast is in this region, at 4.4%.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, we will have to be patient. While the major central banks have completed their key rate hikes, they are not yet done with inflation. The mechanical and rapid decline in total inflation must be succeeded by a more arduous decline in core inflation, which is likely to resist. In the United States, the Federal Reserve wants to see inflation measured by the PCE ('Personal Consumption Expenditure') index to fall permanently below 3% before easing its monetary policy. In the Euro zone, the risk of demand increasing inflation has disappeared, but the channel of transmission of inflation through wages is still open and the risk of second-round effects cannot be totally ruled out.",

        "page_content": "In our scenario, inflation rates will slowly converge towards the 'comfort  zones'  (which  are  still  unclear)  of  central  banks,  but will still exceed the 2% targets. These inflation prospects justify a scenario of cautious monetary easing: in terms of key rate cuts, market expectations seem 'aggressive'.\n\nIn the United States, our scenario does not anticipate a first decline of 25 basis points until July 2024. The rate of decline is expected to be gradual, with a second cut of 25 basis points only in November, bringing the upper limit of the Fed funds rate to 5% at the end of 2024. The expected decline in growth could enable the Fed to accelerate its cuts in 2025: the upper limit would be located at 3.50% at the end of 2025, a threshold below which the Fed would have difficulty crossing given the persistence of a crisis. inflation above the target and a neutral interest rate likely to be higher than before.\n\nAs for the ECB, it anticipates a deceleration in wages and will wait until this is confirmed. It should also continue to monitor unit profits to ensure that future wage increases are absorbed by margins and not passed on to selling prices. Its first rate cut (25 basis points) should therefore only occur in September 2024. This should be followed by five cuts of 25 basis points each until the ECB reaches its neutral rate, with a deposit rate at 2.50%, in the second quarter of 2025. At the end of 2025, this policy should bring the refinancing and deposit rate to 2.75% and 2.50% respectively, with a tightening of the interest rate corridor.\n\nAs with monetary policy, our long-term interest rate scenario is 'temperate optimism'. Inflation, growth but also the need to avoid easing financial conditions too quickly: everything is inviting central banks to be patient and argues in favour of a moderate decline in long-term rates, once the sequence of key rate cuts has truly begun.\n\nIn the United States, our scenario assumes a decline in sovereign bond yields, when the Fed makes its first cuts, and expects a 10-year rate of around 4% at the end of 2024. In the Euro zone, our scenario for government bond yields does not 'brighten up' until the second half of 2024. The cumulative 75 basis point reduction in ECB key rates in 2024 that our scenario uses from September should then enable the bond markets to begin a phase of moderate decline and steepening. After rising during the first half of 2024, the Bund yield should be around 2.60% at the end of 2024, while 10-year sovereign rates should approach 3.30% in France and 4.60% in Italy.\n\n## Subseque  nt  events\n\nNo  significant  events  occurred  between  the  reporting  date  on 31 December 2023 and the date on which the Board of Directors approved the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other risks and uncertainties which are currently not known or considered as minor could significantly impact Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances in the future.\n\nThe risks described below are inherent in the nature of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's business as well as in the economic, political,  competitive  and  regulatory  environment  in  which  the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group operates.\n\nConsidering the numerous possibilities and uncertainties related to these risks, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is not always able to precisely\n\n## 5.1.1\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO  FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's operating income is impacted by  investment returns and changes in the fair value of its portfolio of financial investments\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group holds an investment portfolio related to the matching of liabilities and particularly guarantees granted to policyholders. As of 31  December 2023, the Group's portfolio of investments amounted to \u20ac409  billion.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is exposed to a number of financial risks in connection with its financial investment portfolio, including:\n\n- z market risk, in particular interest rate risk, which poses a valuation risk to euro-denominated funds, and equity risk. In 2022, a year of increase in interest rates, the change in the fair value of investments recognised at fair value through profit or loss was -\u20ac15.9  billion. It is, one year later in 2023, +\u20ac5.8  billion. At the end of 2023, the amount of financial investments stood at \u20ac294.6  billion, thanks in particular to better oriented financial markets than in 2022;\n- z asset-liability management risks: the evolution of the portfolio's return is negatively impacted by a low interest rate environment (on Euro-denominated life insurance contracts). This low interest rate environment directly affects the rates at which the Group invests and thus the return on its portfolio, which could lead to a decrease in margins. As of 31 December 2023, 76 % of the Group's investments (excluding unit-linked products) consisted of bond products and the Group is pursuing a policy of asset diversification which limits the dilution of the investment portfolio's return, with limited risk taking, notably thanks to the hedges set up on the portfolio. Thus, at the end of 2023, the average return rate on the Group's assets was 2.12%. Such risk does not affect unit-linked contracts, where the policyholder obtains a return directly linked to the return on the underlying asset.\n\nIn  an  unfavourable  market  situation,  these  financial  risks  could therefore have a very significant negative impact on the Group's operating income.\n\nChanges in interest rates, whether a sharp rise in interest rates that could impact the market value of investments, or a longterm low (or negative) interest rate environment, may affect the financial position of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group\n\nAn increase in interest rates may have a significant negative impact on the fair value of the Group's fixed income portfolio, leading to a decrease in unrealised gains which could negatively impact its capital, solvency position, and  net income.\n\nThe sensitivity of the balance sheet to variations in interest rates is presented in note 6.19.6.2 of the consolidated accounts presents an evaluation of the risk impact.\n\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of the bonds the Group may issue to finance the Group's operations or to meet regulatory requirements. For example, in 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances placed an issue of \u20ac500 million of subordinated bonds eligible for Tier  2 capital, with a maturity of 10  years, and bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.875% until their maturity in 2033. By way of comparison, in 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances had placed, in a low interest rate environment, an issue of \u20ac1 billion of subordinated bonds eligible for Tier 2, with a maturity of 10 years, at a fixed rate annual rate of 1.500%.\n\nOn the other hand, a persistently low or even negative interest rate environment can have a significant negative impact on the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's business. As of 31  December 2023, 76  % of the Group's investments (excluding unit-linked products) consisted  of  fixed-income  products.  Low  (or  negative)  interest rates weigh on the return on fixed-income investments, which may be insufficient to cover the minimum guaranteed rates on savings products,  which  could  significantly  affect  the  Group's  operating income  and  solvency  position.  While  the  Group  has  not  issued products with minimum guaranteed rates in excess of zero (beyond one year) since 2000, certain policies issued prior to that date, a portion of which remain outstanding, offered positive guaranteed rates; the average minimum guaranteed rate being 0.08% for all policies as of 31  December 2023, leaving the Group exposed in a\n\nquantify the impact of these risks. However, many risk management processes,  procedures  and  controls  have  been  implemented  in order  to  continuously  monitor  and  manage  these  risks,  which, nevertheless, have their limits like any control system and cannot protect with absolute certainty against all of the risks described below or losses liable to be generated.\n\nIn addition, if the risks described below lead to quantifiable financial losses  and/or  a  potential  material  liability,  these  elements  are reflected  in  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  consolidated financial statements, in accordance with applicable IFRS accounting standards.",

For comparison, the yield on Group investments as of 31 December 2023  was 2.12%.\n\n## General economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect the market value of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's investments and its business\n\nThe  market  value  of  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's investments could be impacted by the general situation of financial markets, or by the situation of particular sectors or geographic markets to which the Group is exposed. As of 31 December 2023, the Group's investments by asset class of the life entities (excluding unit-linked products) consisted of 76% % fixed income products, 9 % real estate and 7 % equities, and 8 % others. At that same date, the breakdown of the Group's investment portfolio (consisting of assets owned directly, excluding Mudum Seguros and CA Assicurazioni as well as derivatives, repurchase agreements, and Intragroup loans) by economic sector included 34%  government, 21% financial and securitisation institutions, 25% corporate, 11% public sector agencies and 9% real estate. The Group's investments by geographic area (consisting of assets owned directly, excluding Mudum Seguros and CA  Assicurazioni  as  well  as  derivatives,  repurchase  agreements, Intragroup loans) at the same date included 60% of investments in France, 24% in the Euro zone (excluding France), 5% Europe nonEuro zone, 7% Americas and 4 % other. The Group's total exposure to sovereign debt was \u20ac58.6 billion, of which 62% was exposure to France, 13% exposure to Italy, 13% exposure to Spain, 7% exposure to Belgium and 5% exposure to other countries.\n\nA number of factors could negatively impact economic conditions and  consumer  confidence  resulting  in  volatile  financial  markets. Among  other  things,  these  factors  include  concerns  over  the creditworthiness of certain sovereign issuers, high levels of corporate indebtedness,  the  fluctuations  of  foreign  currencies  against  the Euro, the availability and cost of credit, the stability and solvency of certain financial institutions and other companies, central bank intervention in the financial markets, energy costs, trade disputes and geopolitical issues and pandemics. Moreover, extreme market events, such as the global financial crisis during 2008 and 2009, have led, and could in the future lead, to a liquidity crisis, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation of the values of all asset classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a widening of credit spreads. These factors, as well as adverse economic conditions in general, could lead to significant declines in the market value and performance of the investment portfolio and a decline in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's business.\n\nInternational  conflicts,  such  as  the  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as the economic sanctions measures adopted in response by a number of countries (including France, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States), may have widespread economic and financial repercussions. These conflicts can exacerbate instability in global markets, with a negative impact on stock market indices, increases in commodity prices (particularly oil, gas and agricultural products such as wheat), worsening supply chain disruptions, increases in\n\nproduction costs and additional inflationary pressures beyond those already observed in recent months. These difficult conditions in the global economy and financial markets could have significant negative effects on the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and its customers. These conditions may continue or worsen as the conflict evolves.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's hedging programmes may be inadequate to protect the Group against the full extent of the risks or losses the Group seeks to mitigate, which could negatively impact the Group's business, operating income and financial condition\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group uses derivatives to hedge certain risks. As of 31 December 2023, the notional amount of the Group's total hedging derivative instruments was \u20ac0.9 billion. For further quantitative information, see note 5.2 of the Consolidated financial statements at 31  December 2023. The Group's hedging techniques  are  designed  to  reduce  the  economic  impact  of unfavourable changes to certain of the Group's exposures to interest rate risk and other factors. In certain cases, however, the hedges are not perfect or are limited compared to the overall exposure, due, for example, to the insufficient size of the derivative market or due to its lack of liquidity, or due to excessive hedging costs or the very nature of the risk which cannot always be hedged. This may result in losses due to hedging imperfections as well as unanticipated cash needs to collateralise or settle certain transactions. In addition, hedging counterparties may fail to perform their obligations, resulting in losses on positions that are not collateralised. The operation of the Group's hedging program is based on models and assumptions that may not fully reflect reality and may therefore give rise to a risk, which could have a material impact on its business, operating income and financial position.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's valuation of investments that lack an active trading market or observable market data may change as a result of changes in methodologies, estimations or assumptions, or may prove inaccurate\n\nCertain of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's investment assets, for which there is no active trading market or other observable market  data,  are  valued  using  models  and  methodologies  that involve estimates, assumptions  and  significant  management judgement.\n\nDuring periods of market disruption like those we have experienced over the past several years, a larger portion of the Group's investment assets may be valued using these models and methodologies as a result of less frequent trading or less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes that were previously actively traded  in  liquid  markets.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the Group's valuations on the basis of these models and methodologies represent the actual price for which a security may ultimately be sold or at specific point in time. Use of different models, methodologies and/or assumptions may have an impact on the estimated fair value amounts and inaccurate valuations could have a material negative effect on the Group's operating income and financial condition.\n\n1 5",

These parties  include  private  sector  and  government  (or  governmentbacked) issuers whose securities the Group holds, reinsurers to which the Group has ceded insurance risks, customers, derivatives counterparties,  or  other  counterparties  including  brokers  and dealers,  commercial  and  investment  banks,  investment  funds, clearing members,  market  exchanges,  clearing  houses  and other financial institutions. As of 31  December 2023, the Group's investments by economic sector included 34%  government, 21% financial and securitisation, 25% corporate, 11% public agencies and 9% real estate. In addition, as of 31 December 2023, the breakdown of the Group's bond portfolio, which represents 76 % of the investment portfolio, by credit rating included 9% exposure to bonds rated AAA, 41% exposure to bonds rated AA, 32% exposure to bonds rated A, 17% exposure to bonds rated BBB, less than 1% exposure to bonds rated BB or lower and 1% exposure to non-rated bonds. For further quantitative information on the Group's counterparty risk exposure,\n\nsee item entitled 'Credit risk ' in the section 5.3  'Risk factors and risk management procedures - Quantitative and qualitative information'.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's reported earnings\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group publishes its consolidated financial  statements  in  euros.  A  small  portion  of  the  Group's revenue, of financial income, as well as the Group's benefits, claims and other deductions are denominated in currencies other than the euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates can have a very moderate impact on the Group's operating income, cash flows, investments value, shareholders' equity and solvency. As of 31 December 2023, the Group's foreign exchange risk related primarily to structural exposure to the yen for its CA Life Japan subsidiary (net exposure equivalent to \u20ac7.7 million) and to the Polish zloty for its CA Zycie subsidiary (net exposure equivalent to \u20ac4.4  million), as well as the  risk  of  operational  foreign  exchange  exposure  arising  from a mismatch between the currency of assets and liabilities in the Group's global portfolio. For additional quantitative information on the Group's exposure to foreign exchange risk, please refer to the 'Foreign exchange risk' section of note  6.19.7. Risks arising from contracts falling within the scope of IFRS 17 consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\n## 5.1.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group may not b e able to meet its obligations to pay minimum guaranteed returns and the surrender value of policies in connection with its savings and retirement business\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's principal business is savings and retirement, which consists of offering insurance policies that provide policyholders with investment returns, and that can either be surrendered for their cash value at the option of the policyholders or paid out to the beneficiaries in the event of death. In 2023, the savings and retirement business accounted for 71% of the Group's gross written premiums.\n\nThe Group's savings and retirement business is subject to risks related to the guaranteed surrender value of its euro-denominated contracts. Under these contracts, the surrender value is not tied to the fair value of the underlying assets (unlike unit-linked contracts that provide the policyholders with returns specifically tied to underlying assets or indices), which leads to the risk of asset and liability valuation mismatches. If rapid increases in interest rates or other factors lead to a large increase in surrender rates by policyholders, the Group may be unable to meet its obligations under the surrender value of these contracts. As of 31 December 2023, the Group had \u20ac330.3 billion of savings and retirement outstandings, of which 71% came from euro-denominated contracts.\n\nThe Group's life insurance business is also subject to risks related to minimum guaranteed rates offered to policyholders on some of its euro-denominated contracts issued before 2000, corresponding on average to a minimum guaranteed rate of 0.08% for all of the Group's contracts as of 31 December 2023. For these contracts, if investment income falls below the guaranteed rates, the Group may not be able to meet its obligations under the minimum guaranteed rates. In 2023, the return rate on the Group's investments was 2.12%\n\nand the Group had a policyholder participation reserve ('PPE') of \u20ac9.8 billion, representing 4.5% of outstandings in euro.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  the  Group's  obligations  with  respect  to the surrender value or minimum guaranteed rates would have a significant impact on the Group's financial position.\n\n## Because the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's business is concentrated in France, a downturn in the French market could have a disproportionate impact on the Group's operating income\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's life and non-life segments in France accounted for 87 % of the Group's gross written premiums. At the same date, 60% of the Group's investments were concentrated on issuers located in France. As a consequence, a sharp deterioration in French economic conditions would significantly affect the Group's operating income, and would impact the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group more than a group with more diversified international activities.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance business may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates\n\nIn addition to impacting the Group's financial investments and the valuation of insurance contracts under IFRS 17, changes in prevailing interest  rates  also  affect  the  Group's  insurance  operations.  For example, in periods of declining interest rates, euro-denominated savings and retirement products may be relatively more attractive to consumers due to better expected returns compared to other types of savings investments available to them, which could result in a higher rate of savings and retirement contract renewals, creating potentially significant duration mismatches with the asset portfolio if the change is not anticipated.",

        "page_content": "Conversely, in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, surrender rates in savings and retirement contracts may increase as  policyholders  choose  to  forego  the  protection  provided  by insurance  and  seek  higher  investment  returns.  In  2023,  in  an environment of rising interest rates, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's redemption rate was 5.5%. An unanticipated increase in policy surrenders could require the Group to liquidate fixed maturity investments in order to obtain cash to satisfy surrender obligations at a time when market prices for such assets are depressed, leading to significant realised investment losses for the Group. Accelerated surrenders may also cause the Group to accelerate amortisation of deferred contracts acquisition costs, which would reduce the Group's net income.\n\n## Claims experience could be inconsistent with the assumptions used to price the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's products and establish its reserves\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  earnings  depend  to  a large extent upon the adequacy of its claims experience with the assumptions the Group uses in setting the prices for the Group's products and establishing the liabilities for obligations relating to technical provisions (under French standards). These assumptions concern,  for  example,  changes  in  mortality  or  morbidity,  the behaviour of policyholders, and the frequency and cost of claims. The Group uses both its own experience and industry data to develop estimates of future claims and policy benefits, including information used  in  pricing  insurance  products  and  establishing  the  related actuarial liabilities. However, the claims experience may be higher than the assumptions used for pricing and establishing reserves. This risk mainly concerns products from the Death & Disability/ Creditor/Group  Insurance  and  Property  &  Casualty  businesses, which accounted for 14% and 15% of the Group's premium income in  2023,  respectively.  It  is  particularly  important  as  obligations to clients are long, as is the case with creditor or long-term care insurance products. In 2023, creditor insurance premium income was \u20ac3.3 billion. Thus, if the Group's actual benefits paid to policyholders are greater than the assumptions on which the pricing was based and the provisions were established, the Group's operating income and financial position may be materially affected.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is subject to risks specific to the death & disability, creditor and Group insurance segments\n\nIn 2023, 14% of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's gross written premiums originated in the death & disability, creditor and Group insurance segments. These segments include insurance products designed to protect against the financial consequences of a serious life event (death, hospitalisation, serious injury, disability or longterm care needs), guarantee the repayment of a loan in the event of  disability  or  unemployment  and  to  provide  additional  health insurance services for employees. In these segments, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk that mortality rates will be higher than expected for policyholders with death coverage or the risk that policyholders with disability coverage will experience health needs that are in excess of those expected when the policies were written. In addition, the Group's life and health insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality and disease, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. If any such event occurs, or if the Group's assumptions related to mortality rates,  life  expectancies  and  other  health-related  factors  used  in pricing insurance policies prove incorrect, the Group's operating income could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's loss reserves for the property & casualty segment may prove to be inadequate\n\nAs of 31  December 2023, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's property & casualty segment accounted for 15% of the Group's gross written premiums. In accordance with industry practices, the Group establishes reserves for claims and claims expenses related to the Group's property & casualty segment. As of 31  December 2023, the Group's combined ratio in France (Pacifica scope) i.e. the ratio of claims, management fees and commissions on gross premiums, net of reinsurance, including discounting and excluding the effect of unwinding the discount - is 97.1%. If the Group were required to increase its technical liabilities or were to incur greater losses than expected, its combined ratio would increase, and its operating income would decline. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent estimates, generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date. These  reserve  estimates  are  expectations  of  what  the  ultimate settlement  and  administration  of  claims  will  cost  based  on  the Group's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of  historical  settlement  patterns,  estimates  of  trends  in  claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. The Group continuously monitors the adequacy of the reserves built up, the evolution of emerging claims and actual claims in relation to the assumptions made when estimating the gross reserves built up. No assurance can be given that ultimate losses will not exceed the claims reserves and have a moderate negative effect on the Group's operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is subject to risks specific to catastrophic events, which by definition are unpredictable and can increase the volatility of the Group's operating income\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, particularly in its principal market  of  France,  which  represents  87 %  of  its  2023  premium income. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks, military actions and core infrastructure failures. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes or man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life or property damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. In addition, changing  climate  conditions,  primarily  global  warming,  may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, and result in greater than expected losses. Although the Group takes efforts to limit its exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not eliminate all risk and claims resulting from catastrophic events could therefore moderately affect the Group's operating income and increase its volatility. Recent examples of natural catastrophes that have led to an increase in claims in the Group's non-life insurance business include the Ciaran and Domingos storms in November 2023, and the hailstorms of summer 2022, which had a material impact on the Group's operating income.\n\n1 5",

These events may also affect the financial condition of the Group's reinsurers, thereby  increasing  the  probability  of  default  on  reinsurance recoveries. Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt the Group's business and the value of its investments or ability to write new business. It is possible that increases in the value of insurance policies, caused by the effects of inflation or other factors, and geographic concentration of insured lives or property, could increase the severity of claims the Group receives from future catastrophic events. Due to their nature, the Group cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of any such catastrophe, which could lead to increases in claims and moderately adversely affect the Group's operating income.\n\n## Default of a reinsurer or increased reinsurance costs could adversely affect net income\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group reinsures with reinsurance companies to limit its risks. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on prevailing market conditions, in terms of price and available capacity, which may vary significantly.\n\nWhile  the  purpose  of  reinsurance  agreements  is  to  transfer  a portion of losses and related expenses to other insurers, they do not eliminate the requirement for the Group, the direct insurer, to settle claims. In this regard, the Group is subject to the solvency risk of its reinsurers at the time that sums due must be recovered from them. Although the Group initially places its reinsurance with reinsurers that the Group believes to be financially stable, its assessment may be incorrect and the financial stability of a reinsurer may change adversely by the time recoveries are due. The accounting value of reinsurance contract portfolios held that are assets is \u20ac1.1 billion. Informations about the credit quality of reinsurance contracts is presented in note 6.19.6.4 of the consolidated financial statements.  A reinsurer's failure to make payment under the terms of a significant reinsurance contract would have a moderate negative effect on the Group's businesses, financial condition and net income. In addition,\n\nafter making large claims under reinsurance policies, the Group may have to pay substantial reinstatement premiums to continue reinsurance coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on overall current economic conditions and may vary considerably. In future, the Group may be unable to obtain a reinsurance contract at commercially reasonable prices. Such a situation may increase the risk of losses, due to a low level of reinsurance, or adversely affect the Group's income statement due to the increase in the cost of reinsurance for activities already reinsured.\n\n## A sustained increase in the inflation rate in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's principal markets would have multiple impacts on the Group, particularly in the pricing of insurance related products, and may negatively affect the Group's business, solvency position and operating income\n\nA sustained increase in the inflation rate in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's principal markets could have multiple impacts on  the  Group  and  may  negatively  affect  the  Group's  business, solvency  position  and  operating  income.  In  non-life  insurance, whose  revenue  represented  15%  of  the  Group's  gross  written premiums  in 2023, a sustained increase in inflation rates may lead to (i)  an increase in the amount claimed in respect of claims, i.e. increase the final amount paid in order to settle the amount due in respect of the claim, several years after the guarantee period or after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the claim, accompanied by, (ii)  an under-estimation, at the time of their establishment, of the reserves corresponding to these claims, due to the inability to fully anticipate inflation and its effects on the amounts actually paid to policyholders, and, consequently, (iii)  a significant surplus of the actual payments over the insurance reserves, which will have a moderate impact on the Group's operating income. In 2023, 96% of the Group's property and casualty insurance gross written premiums came from the French market. The average rate of inflation in France in 2023 was 4.9%. A failure to accurately anticipate higher inflation and factor it into the Group's product pricing assumptions may also lead  to  underwriting  losses  which  would  moderately  negatively impact the Group's operating income.\n\n## 5.1.3 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\n\n## T he solvency capital ratios of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and its insurance subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by adverse capital market conditions, evolving regulatory interpretations and other factors\n\nUnder the Solvency  II Directive requirements, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances  Group  is  required  to  maintain  eligible  own  funds sufficient to meet solvency capital requirements. To determine the solvency capital requirement, the regulations allow either a standard formula or an internal model approved by the regulator.\n\nThe Group has chosen to use the standard formula and its assumptions proposed by EIOPA (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), without transitional measures (with the exception of the grandfathering clause on subordinated debt).\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  solvency  capital  ratio  is  sensitive  to capital market conditions (including the level of interest rates, the performance of equity markets and foreign exchange impacts) as well as a variety of other factors. In particular, the Group's solvency position  is  affected  by  the  negative  interest  rate  environment because it impacts investment returns and the Group's ability to meet minimum guaranteed returns in euro-denominated contracts. See risk factor 'Changes in interest rates, whether the continuation of a low (or negative) interest rate environment impacting operating income, or a sharp rise in interest rates that could impact the market value of investments, may affect the financial position of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group'.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2023, an increase of 50 basis points in interest rates would bring the solvency ratio to 196%, while a reduction of 50 basis points would bring it to 235%. At the same date, a 25% drop in equity markets would lower the ratio solvency to 206%, an increase of 75 basis points of corporate spreads would lower the solvency ratio to 197%, and a 75 basis point increase in govies spreads (sovereign debts or government loans) would increase the ratio to 190% solvency.\n\nInsurance  regulators  are  generally  free  to  interpret,  apply  and enforce their rules and regulations regarding the solvency margin and regulatory capital. In times of extreme financial market turmoil, such as those we have experienced in recent years, regulators may become more conservative in interpreting, applying and enforcing related rules, for example by imposing a tightening of the conditions relating  to  regulatory  provisions  for  certain  types  of  risks,  an increase in liquidity requirements, an increase in reductions/haircuts on certain assets or asset classes, more conservative calculation methods or the adoption of any other similar measure that could lead to a significant tightening of regulatory capital requirements.\n\nIn the event of a failure by the Group and/or any of its insurance subsidiaries  to  meet  the  minimum  applicable  regulatory  capital requirements, insurance regulators have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions including limiting or prohibiting the issuance of new business, prohibiting payment of dividends, and/or, in extreme cases, putting a company into rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings. A failure of any of the Group's insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory capital requirements and/or a reduction in the level of their regulatory capital that may negatively impact their competitive position may also result in the Group deciding to inject significant amounts of new capital into its insurance subsidiaries which  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's  liquidity  position, operating income and financial position. Regulatory restrictions that inhibit the Group's ability to freely move excess capital among its subsidiaries or which otherwise restrict fungibility of the Group's capital resources may, depending on the nature and extent of the restrictions,  adversely  affect  the  capital  position  of  the  Group's operating  insurance  subsidiaries  which  may  have  a  consequent negative impact on the Group and the perception of its financial strength. Additional regulatory developments regarding solvency requirements, including further implementing measures under the Solvency  II Directive or changes resulting from further efforts by EIOPA to harmonise implementation of the Solvency  II Directive may lead to further changes in the insurance industry's solvency framework and prudential regime as well as associated costs. It is difficult to predict how the regulations resulting from such initiatives and proposals will affect the insurance industry generally or the Group's operating income, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## Regulatory actions against the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group or an insurer in the Group in the event of resolution could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group\n\nOn 28 November 2017, Ordinance No. 2017-1608 of 27 November 2017 (the 'Ordinance') establishing a resolution framework for insurers was published (Ordinance No. 2017-1608 of 27 November 2017 on the creation of a resolution framework regime for the insurance sector). This Ordinance, which defines the French legal framework providing French insurers with effective resolution strategies, has entered into force.\n\nThe  Ordinance  is  designed  to  provide  the  French  supervision authority, i.e. the Autorit\u00e9  de contr\u00f4 le prudentiel et de r\u00e9 solution (the 'ACPR') with a credible set of tools to intervene in an institution failing or likely to fail (as defined in the Ordinance) so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of an institution's failure on the economy and financial system.\n\nUnder the Ordinance, powers are granted to the ACPR to implement resolution measures with respect to an institution and certain of its affiliates (each a 'Relevant Entity') in circumstances in which the resolution conditions are met - namely that the institution is failing or likely to fail.\n\nWhile the Ordinance does not include bail-in powers such as those applicable to credit institutions, it nonetheless provides the ACPR with resolution tools that could, if used, significantly impact the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group:\n\n- (i) bridge institution: enables the ACPR to transfer all or part of the business of the Relevant Entity to a 'bridge entity';\n- (ii) asset separation: enables the ACPR to transfer impaired or problem assets of the Relevant Entity to asset management vehicles to allow such assets to be managed and worked out over time; and\n- (iii) administrator ( administrateur de r\u00e9 solution ): enables the ACPR to intervene in the corporate governance of the Relevant Entity.\n\nThe impact of the Ordinance on insurance institutions, is currently unclear but its current and future implementation and applicability to  the  Group  or  the  taking  of  any  action  pursuant  to  it  could significantly affect the activity and financial condition of the Group.\n\n## Changes in government policy, regulation or legislation in the countries in which the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group operates may affect the Group's profitability\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  is  subject  to  extensive regulation  and  supervision  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which its  French  and  international  insurance  subsidiaries  do  business, which are mainly France, Italy and Luxembourg, but also other European  countries  and  Japan.  Applicable  regulations  relate  to a  range  of  matters,  including  licensing  and  examination,  rate setting, trade practices, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, underwriting and claims practices, adequacy of the Group's claims provisions, capital and surplus requirements, insurer solvency, transactions between affiliates and the amount of dividends that may be paid.\n\nAs the amount and complexity of these regulations increase, so will the cost of compliance and the risk of non-compliance. If the Group does not meet regulatory or other requirements, the Group may suffer penalties including fines, suspension or cancellation of its insurance licenses which could adversely affect the Group's ability to do business. In particular, the Group is subject to the capital requirements of the Solvency II Directive presented in the risk factor 'The solvency ratios of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group and its insurance subsidiaries may be negatively impacted by the financial market situation, changes in the interpretation of regulations and other factors' and could be resolved by the ACPR as specified in the ordinance presented in the risk factor 'Regulatory measures taken against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group or one of its insurance subsidiaries in the context of a resolution could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial position'. A lack of compliance with the requirements of the Solvency II Directive or any regulatory action against the Group could have material negative financial effects, cause reputational harm or harm the Group's business prospects.\n\n1 5",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the Group may be adversely affected by changes in government  policy  or  legislation  applying  to  companies  in  the insurance industry.\n\nThese  include  possible  changes  in  regulations  covering  selling practices  for  certain  classes  of  products,  regulations  covering policy terms and the imposition of new taxes and assessments or changes in the tax treatment of life insurance savings products and retirement savings plans. Regulatory changes may affect the Group's existing and future businesses by, for example, causing customers to\n\ncancel or not renew existing contracts. One recent example is the adoption of the Bourquin amendment to the Sapin 2 law in France in 2018 which led to the unbundling of mortgage loans and creditor insurance products. It is not possible to determine what changes in government policy or legislation will be adopted in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and, if so, what form they will take or in what jurisdictions they may occur. Insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than the Group's current requirements, may result in higher costs or limit the Group's growth or otherwise adversely affect the Group's operations.\n\n## 5.1.4 OPERATIONAL AND OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED RISKS\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is subject to cyber security risks\n\nThe most significant operational risk faced by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is the risk of unauthorised intrusions into the Group's websites and/or information systems. While no significant cyber security breach has affected the Group to date, the risk of unauthorised intrusions is increasing given the number of incidences of hacking globally. If the Group's information technology systems were  compromised  by  a  security  breach,  the  Group  could  lose the ability to carry out functions that are essential for its activities particularly  in  the  savings  and  retirement  business,  including underwriting new insurance contracts, pricing policies, estimating technical liabilities and reserves, conducting relations with customers and implementing risk management activities with respect to its portfolio of financial investments. Moreover, given that the Group's insurance business requires it to obtain and process a large amount of clients' personal data (banking information, health information, etc.), the Group is subject to the risk that such data may become compromised or subject to unauthorised disclosure in the event of a cyber security breach. The occurrence of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business and operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group could incur significant sanctions if it fails to protect its customers' data\n\nWith the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the 'GDPR'), the data protection framework in the EU has been significantly modified  and  now  includes  new  restrictions  on  data  usage/ processing, disclosures to customers and a stronger enforcement regime.  As  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  insurance business requires it to obtain and process a large amount of personal data of its customers the Group is particularly exposed to risks related to the protection of its customers' data (including banking information, health information, etc.). If the Group's policies and procedures fail to ensure that data collected by the Group and its third-party service providers is processed in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR or other data protection laws, this could result in significant regulatory sanctions (including fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenues) or damage to the Group's reputation and may consequently have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business and operating income.\n\n## Failure to adequately manage the reputational risk of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group could have an adverse effect on its competitive position and business prospects\n\nConsidering the highly competitive environment in which the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  operates,  a  reputation  for  financial strength, solvency and transparency is critical to its ability to attract and  retain  customers  and  employees,  access  markets,  maintain positive  interactions  with  regulatory  authorities  and  compete effectively. The Group's reputation could be harmed as a result of internal operational risks inherent to the business environment in which it operates, by the Group's response to external events affecting its operations, by adverse press coverage or other factors. Further,  the  Group's  membership  in  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Group increases the potential sources of reputational risk to the Group to the extent that any reputational harm to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group or any entity within it may indirectly affect the reputation of its insurance business. Reputational risks may be further compounded by the increasing use of social media channels such as blogs, social networks,  online  commentaries  and  consumer  surveys,  through which damaging and potentially unfounded information may spread rapidly and any such reputational harm could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's competitive position and business prospects.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group faces strong competition in all of its business segments\n\nThere  is  substantial  competition  among  general  insurance companies in France and the other jurisdictions in which the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group does business, in particular in Italy and Luxembourg and some of the Group's competitors may benefit from greater financial and marketing resources or name recognition than the Group. In France, the Group is the largest life insurance provider (source: L'Argus de l'assurance, 7 april  2023, based on  premiums and outstanding at the end of 2022), the sixth largest property and casualty insurer (source: L'Argus de l'assurance, 13   December 2023, based on premiums at the end of 2022) and the second largest creditor insurer  (source: L'Argus de l'assurance, 1 september  2023, based on premiums at the end of 2022).",

        "page_content": "The Group's competitors include not only other insurance companies, but also mutual fund companies, asset management firms, private equity firms, hedge funds and commercial and investment banks, many of which are regulated differently than the Group is and may be able to offer alternative products or more competitive pricing than the Group. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance and securities products, including through the internet, may result in increasing competition\n\nas well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. While the Group seeks to maintain premium rates at targeted levels, the effect of competitive market conditions may have a material adverse effect on the Group's market share and financial condition. These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of the Group's products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, which could harm the Group's ability to market certain products profitably.\n\n## 5.1.5 RISKS RELATED TO THE CR\u00c9 DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES GROUP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CR\u00c9 DIT AGRICOLE GROUP\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group relies primarily on entities in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group to distribute its insurance products and perform a range of other important services\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group relies primarily on the networks of banks affiliated with the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group to distribute its products. In 2023, 94% of revenue came from the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group's banking networks or its partners and only 6% from external partnerships. As a result, factors affecting the competitive position, reputation or credit quality of the banks in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group could have a very significant adverse effect on the Group's gross written premiums, reputation and operating income. Similarly, in countries where the Group distributes its products primarily through other partner banks, such as Japan, factors affecting the reputation, performance or credit quality of those banks could have an adverse impact on sales of the Group's products through those channels. In addition to the distribution of its products, the Group has also entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with members of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group and other third-party service providers for certain other services required in connection with the day-today operation of the Group's insurance businesses. Deficiencies in the performance of outsourced services may expose the Group to substantial operational, financial and reputational risk. The Group's reliance on its affiliates to provide it with important services may give rise to conflicts of interest. Failure to manage these conflicts of interest appropriately could have a very significant adverse effect on the Group's reputation, gross written premiums or operating income.\n\n## The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group may not realise the targets set out for the Group in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group's Project & 2025 Medium-Term Plan\n\nOn 22 June 2022, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group announced its 2025 Medium-Term  Plan  entitled  'Ambitions  2025',  setting  specific targets  for  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  and  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Group's insurance business. These targets were published separately by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances on 14  September 2022. The 2025 Medium-Term Plan was drawn up for internal planning purposes in order to develop the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group's strategy and enable it to allocate resources.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' contribution to the Ambitions 2025 Medium-Term  Plan  is  based  on  ambitious  goals  of  developing its  core  business  lines  in  France  and  worldwide  between  now and 2025, and expanding its range of products and services, in particular in the fields of healthcare, ageing well and retirement. Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is also aiming to become the leading digital insurance company and market leader in terms of customer satisfaction by 2025.\n\nThis is reflected in the following quantified targets:\n\n- z savings assets under management of over \u20ac345  billion, and \u20ac23 billion in retirement savings;\n- z unit-linked assets under management of over \u20ac110 billion, and doubling the level of certified unit-linked assets under management;\n- z 25% of total gross written premiums  generated outside France;\n- z cost/income ratio of less than 15% (after transition to IFRS 17);\n- z business revenues of \u20ac1.5 billion;\n- z 40% increase in health insurance beneficiaries;\n- z 2.5 million additional individual property and casualty insurance contracts in France;\n- z 14 GW of renewables installed capacity financed;\n- z 20% of property and casualty insurance underwriting on a self-care basis;\n- z 25% of total gross written premiums  generated outside France;\n- z 14 GW of renewables installed capacity financed.\n\nThe plan is based on a number of assumptions and is therefore, by definition,  subject  to  uncertainties.  Although  the  2025  MediumTerm Plan is underpinned by what are deemed to be reasonable assumptions, there are no guarantees that these will prove correct. Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances may not achieve the targets set out in the 2025 Medium-Term Plan for its business for a number of reasons,  some  of  which  -  such  as  the  economic  and  financial climate worldwide, in Europe and in France - are outside its control. The 2025 Medium-Term Plan is subject to change and there is no obligation to update or revise the information contained in the 2025 Medium-Term Plan in the light of new information or future events or for other reasons.\n\nThe success of the plan relies on a very large number of initiatives within the various business units of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group. While many of these may succeed, it is possible that not all targets will be achieved, which could have a significant negative impact on the Group's ability to achieve one or more of the targets set out in the 2025 Medium-Term Plan, as well as damaging its image on the markets depending on the extent to which these targets are achieved and the circumstances resulting in some targets not being achieved. The Medium-Term Plan also includes a high level of investment, but if the targets of the plan are not achieved, the return on these investments will be lower than expected.\n\n1 5",

At the end of 2023, the workforce allocated to these functions for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group amounted to 208.5 FTEs compared to 182.2 FTEs at the end of 2022, i.e. +26.3 FTEs of which +6.4 related to changes in scope, notably in Italy. They are divided into 76.9 in the Permanent Control and Risk functions, 65.1 in the Compliance Control function, 47 in the Periodic Control function and 19.5 in the Actuarial function. Each of these four key functions (Risk Management, Compliance, Actuarial function, Internal Audit) is headed by a manager appointed by Executive Management, approved by the Board of Directors and notified to the competent national Supervisory authority.\n\nIt should be noted that the internal control system implemented by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is part of the framework of standards and principles set forth below and adapted and appropriately deployed across the various business lines and risks in order to best observe insurance-related  and,  as  the  subsidiary  of  a  credit  institution, banking-related regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances satisfies the new regulatory requirements of the Solvency II Directive (effective since 1 January 2016) with its three pillars, thanks to its adaptation over several years of its organisation and procedures, as necessary. Further information on Solvency II is given in the 'Solvency' section of 'Presentation of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 5.2.1 INTERNAL CONTROL REFERENCE TEXTS\n\nInternal  control  standards  are  derived  from  the  regulati ons applicable to insurance companies (Insurance Code in France and its equivalent in other countries where Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances subsidiaries are based).\n\nIn addition, as a subsidiary of a banking group, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is subject:\n\n- z to the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Article L. 511-41);\n- z to the Decree of 3  November 2014 on the internal control of banking, payment services and investment services firms subject to supervision by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR);\n- z to  the  AMF  General  Regulation  and  the  Basel  Committee recommendations on internal control, risk management and solvency.\n\nThese national and international external standards are supplemented  by  internal  standards  specific  to  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole,\n\nas well as by procedures and standards specific to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries.\n\nWithin this context, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. issued procedural notes regarding the organisation of internal control and a body of rules and procedures relating, in particular, to accounting (Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole chart of accounts), financial management, risk management and permanent controls. It also adopted, in 2004, a set of procedural notes  to  control  its  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  (in particular, in relation to financial security), which have been rolled out by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group entities. This procedural system  is  regularly  updated  to  take  into  account  regulatory developments and changes in the internal control scope.\n\nAn Operating Charter was signed by the main French subsidiaries and by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances S.A. holding company with the Risk Management and Permanent Control function to be applied to international subsidiaries.",

These were approved by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries in their respective areas. Among these policies, it should be noted that a Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group risk management policy exists at the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group level. This serves as a frame of reference for the organisation of the internal control system.\n\n## 5.2.2 ORGANISATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## Fundamental principles\n\nThe organisational pri nciples and components of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurance's internal control system, which are common to all Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group entities, cover obligations with regard to:\n\n- z reporting to the decision-making body (risk framework, risk limits and use of such limits, internal control activity and results);\n- z the direct involvement of the executive body in the organisation and operation of the internal control system;\n- z the comprehensive coverage of all business operations and risks, and accountability of all persons involved;\n- z the  clear  definition  of  tasks,  effective  segregation  of  the commitment  and  control  functions,  formal  and  up-to-date delegations of authority;\n- z formal, up-to-date standards and procedures, especially in the area of accounting.\n\nThese principles are supplemented by:\n\n- z risk  measurement,  monitoring  and  management  systems: financial risks (assets/liabilities, counterparty risk, liquidity risk, etc.), insurance business-related techniques, operational risks (transaction processing, IT processing), accounting risks (including the  quality  of  financial  and  accounting  information),  noncompliance and legal risks;\n- z a control system, forming part of a dynamic and corrective process, encompassing permanent controls, which are carried out by the operating units themselves or by specific staff, and periodic controls (carried out by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Internal Audit department and the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Control and Audit function).\n\nFurthermore,  across  the  various  business  lines,  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Assurances' objectives and strategy are taken into consideration when changes are made to internal control systems, particularly via the Risk Management and Internal Control Committees and NAP (new business and new products) Committees.\n\n## Oversight\n\n## Respective responsibilities of the business lines with control functions\n\nsystem and compliance with the principles listed above over the entire scope of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances internal control. Their organisation was as follows on 31 December 2023:\n\n- z the Risk Management Officer (RCPR) of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group has a hierarchical reporting line to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department (DRG), and a functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group Executive Management. In France, the RCPRs of the entities have a hierarchical reporting line to the Risks director of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and a functional line to the Chief Executive Officer of their entity; internationally, the RCPRs have a hierarchical reporting line to a non-executive function, a director or to the Chief Executive Officer of their entity, in compliance with the legislation of the country and a functional reporting line to the Risks director of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group;\n- z Compliance Control falls within the scope of the enhanced compliance  programme  of  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Group.  The Compliance Officer of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group has a hierarchical reporting line to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group's Compliance department and a functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group Executive Management. The Compliance Officers in the subsidiaries have a hierarchical reporting line to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' Compliance department and a functional reporting line to their Executive Management;\n- z the Permanent Control system ensures the integration of the control system in general, including non-compliance risks (mapping, local and consolidated control plan, action plans);\n- z Internal Audit operates as a third level of control throughout the entire Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group. Its operation is governed by the internal audit policy of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, as approved by the Board of Directors, a policy which establishes its independence from operational functions. The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Audit director has a hierarchical reporting line to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Control and Audit function, and a functional reporting line to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management.\n\nFinally,   Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  set  up  the  Actuarial function,  required  under  Solvency  II,  at  the  level  of  the  Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  and  its  insurance  subsidiaries.  On 31  December 2023 , the heads of the Actuarial function for Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries, had a hierarchical and a functional reporting line to their Executive Management.\n\nIn terms of banking regulation, three separate control functions ensure the consistency and effectiveness of the internal control\n\n1 5",

The tasks of these key functions are specified in the 'Solvency' section of the 'Presentation of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis Committee meets 11 times a year under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances. It is composed of the members of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's Executive Committee  (in  particular  the  three  executive  directors  and  the heads of key functions), and representatives of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A.'s control business lines.\n\nThe  purpose  of  this  Committee  is  to  reinforce  cross-functional actions to be implemented within the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group. Its role is to review common internal control issues and to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of internal control and, in particular:\n\n- z to carry out progress reports on the work of the four key functions;\n- z to validate the internal control system;\n- z to validate the draft Solvency II policies to be submitted to the Board of Directors for validation;\n- z to draw up an assessment of the control of financial, technical, operational and non-compliance risks;\n- z to validate and ensure the follow-up of the main associated action plans;\n- z to validate Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group's risk management strategy;\n- z to make decisions on remedial measures.\n\nIt includes  the  prerogatives  of  the  Compliance  Management Committee within the scope of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group. Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' Data Protection Officer also reports on their activity and submits, if necessary, opinions for decision to the Committee.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's Compliance director acts as  the  secretary  of  the  Risk  Management  and  Internal  Control Committee and prepares the agenda in consultation with the other participants, supervises the drafting of the minutes and monitors the implementation of the decisions taken by the Committee.\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is informed of the organisation, operation and results of the internal control system. It is involved in understanding the main risks to which the company is exposed.\n\nOn this basis, it is regularly informed of the overall limits set as acceptable levels of such risks. It is also notified of levels of use of such limits.\n\nReports  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  and  risk management systems are submitted on a regular basis to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Assurances  Group  governance  bodies  which  are  also informed of the main incidents identified.\n\nIn addition to the information that it receives on a regular basis, the Audit and Accounts Committee informs the Board of the main risks incurred by the company and of significant incidents picked up by internal control and risk management systems.\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the overall organisation of the holding company and of its internal control system. It also approves the overall organisation of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group as well as that of its internal control system.\n\nIn addition, it is informed, at least twice a year, by the executive body and the heads of the three control functions, of internal control activities and results, either directly or via feedback given to the Audit and Accounts Committee. In accordance with the Solvency II Directive, the heads of the four key functions have direct access to the Board of Directors, to which they present the results of their work at least once a year.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit and Accounts Committee reports to the Board on the Committee's work.\n\n## Role of the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nThis  Committee  is  responsible  for  verifying  the  clarity  of  the information  provided  and  of  assessing  the  appropriateness  of accounting methods used to prepare the consolidated and parent company financial statements as well as the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control system.\n\nAs  such,  it  has  broad  communications  powers  in  respect  of  all information relating to periodic control, permanent control, including accounting and financial control, and Compliance control. Since the beginning of 2016, these communication powers were extended to the Actuarial function.\n\nAccordingly, it receives periodic reports on activity management systems and risk measurement.\n\nCommittee  meetings  also  include  an  update  on  internal  audit activities,  thereby  enabling  audits  to  be  monitored  as  well  as the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  made  by  national supervisory authorities, by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Control and Audit function and by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Internal Audit function.\n\n## Role of the executive body: Executive Management\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the two others executive directors appointed under the Solvency II Directive are directly involved in the  organisation  and  operation  of  the  internal  control  system. They ensure that risk strategies and limits are compatible with the financial position (capital base, earnings) and strategic guidelines set by the decision-making body.",

Group Risk Management department and functionally to the Chief Executive  Officer  of  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances.  Head  of  a  key function within the meaning of Solvency II, the director in charge of  the  Risk  Management  function  is  responsible  for  the  overall supervision of the risks of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and, among other things, ensuring consistency and standardisation within the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group. He/she is assisted by the Risk Management Officers at the different entities, who report to him/her on a hierarchical basis for French entities and on a functional basis for international entities and have a fully operational role within the respective entities. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, both French and international subsidiaries are provided with the necessary means of managing the risks inherent in their specific business activities. Each subsidiary uses risk measurement, monitoring and control systems for all risks (market risks, including liquidity,  counterparty,  insurance  and  reinsurance  technical  risks, operational  risks,  compliance  and  legal  risks)  depending  on  its business activities and its organisation, and incorporates them into its internal control system.\n\nA  description  of  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  risk exposure is presented in the 'Risk factors and risk management procedures' section. Due to their savings and retirement activities, life insurance entities are, more specifically, exposed to market risks and risks associated with assets/liabilities management. Non-life insurance entities are mainly exposed to insurance and reinsurance technical risks.\n\nThe  organisation  and  operation  of  the  Insurance  Risk  business function is based on a matrix approach which takes into account, on the one hand, the supervision of all the Risks of each entity by its Risk Management Officer and, on the other hand, the management of major risks centrally at the holding company level. Financial risks are  monitored  by  a  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  Financial Risks advisor, who operates across all entities to analyse financial risks (in an advisory capacity) and define a risk framework (proposal of a Financial Risk framework and associated risk policies). The other major risks are also managed according to a Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group approach, with coordination and consolidation given direct impetus by the holding company (technical risks), or by sharing best practices for harmonisation purposes (operational risks). Monitoring and management of information systems security across the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group are also centralised in the holding company, under the aegis of the Information Systems\n\nRisk Manager, and are separated from operational monitoring of those risks, which is under the aegis of the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), also centralised at the holding company level.\n\nTo carry out its strategic orientations, by managing and regulating its risks in a proper manner, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group has implemented a risk appetite framework which has to be observed. It is implemented in key indicators, by the nature of risks, which provide the foundation of its Risk framework.\n\nThe Risk framework implemented by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group formalises the risk management system and the limits and alert thresholds for the range of different risks it is exposed to through the implementation of its business strategy.\n\nIt is reviewed and validated, as well as the risk appetite framework, at least annually, by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances, after review by the Credit Agricole  S.A. Group Risk Management Committee (a sub-Committee of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A.'s Executive Committee,  chaired  by  its  Chief  Executive  Officer)  of  the  main indicators and limits. With regard to limits of their responsibilities, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Executive Management and Board of Directors or even the Credit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department is notified of any breaches of alert thresholds or limits and, when appropriate, the resulting corrective measures.\n\nThe limits system includes, particularly for market risks, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group consolidated limits, set in reference to assets under management (the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group total portfolio), on allocations in terms of assets classes and risk spreading (by class of rating, by counterparty, by sector, etc.). It is supplemented by alert limits and thresholds to manage Predica (the main Group life insurance company) assets/liabilities risks. In addition, the technical and climate risks of the Group's entities are monitored by means of indicators measuring the ratio between claims and contributions, compared to an alert threshold defined by each of the companies, a model validation monitoring indicator and a carbon footprint monitoring indicator. To control counterparty risk in reinsurance programs, the quality of the reinsurer is subject to a minimum rating criterion.\n\nEach entity adopts the limits and risk appetite framework of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group through a process coordinated by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances, taking into account the specificities of life insurance and non-life insurance companies. Furthermore, they have formal risk policies and procedures providing a strict framework for  risk  management:  rules  for  accepting  risk  when  insurance contracts are taken out, hedging of technical risks by reinsurance (action thresholds), claims management, decisions based on formal analyses, authorisations, 'four-eyes' principle (second reading, two signatures) where justified by amounts or risk levels, rules governing management mandates granted to asset managers, etc.\n\n1 5",

It covers all  categories  of  commitments  (on-  and  off-balance  sheet)  and positions, and consolidates commitments to companies belonging to the same group, by aggregating all portfolios and identifying risk levels.\n\nThese  measurements  are  supplemented  by  regular  assessments based on stress scenarios. In this regard, each year, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries conduct the ORSA exercise, a multiannual  forward-looking  assessment  to  analyse  changes  in  their risk profile and solvency, including in negative cases. Prospective assessment  can  be  carried  out  more  often  if  necessary.  The measurement  methodologies  on  which  these  assessments  are based are documented and explained. They are subject to periodic review in order to check their relevance and adaptation to the risks incurred. The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group Insurance Models Committee, under the responsibility of the Group Risk function, validates the methodologies underpinning the models and indicators used  to  address  major  risks  for  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances Group or presenting cross-sector challenges for the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\nEach entity controls the risks involved. This oversight takes the form of  permanent  monitoring  of  limits  exceeded  and  corresponding adjustments  and  technical  and  price  monitoring  of  insurance contracts, particularly for new or specialised business. In property and  casualty  insurance,  matching  the  level  of  provisioning (corresponding to the commitment to pay out for claims made by policyholders) to the real cost of claims, is measured at regular intervals.\n\nOn  its  part,  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  holding  company provides to the governance a comprehensive and consolidated view of the Insurance business risk by producing a Flash-risk dashboard including quarterly review of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group risks,  supplemented  by  monthly  risk  updates.  More  specifically, for financial risks, a monthly report makes it possible to ensure compliance with the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's consolidated aggregate limits and to monitor consumption in relation to such limits. For technical risks, reporting on policyholder behaviour makes it possible to strengthen the monitoring of surrenders/cancellations. Bodies have also been set up to manage risks consistently at the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group level: a bi-monthly meeting of the Risk Management Committee, a monthly meeting of the Financial Risk Committee, specialist portfolio reviews (equities, real estate, etc.), quarterly fixed-income portfolio reviews with both the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Group Risk Management department and with the Amundi Credit Risk teams, within the context of asset management services outsourced to Amundi.\n\nThe entities also have their own Risk dashboard. Any anomalies identified, any non-compliant accounting classifications as well as any instances where limits fail to be met, are reported to the entity's appropriate  management  levels,  to  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances and potentially to the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Risk Management and Permanent Control department, depending on the procedures laid down.\n\nIn this context, significant incidents, whose trigger thresholds for each type of risk identified are calibrated by the entities according to their size, are reported in accordance with the alert procedure.\n\nThe following have been validated by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances:\n\n- z thresholds for strategic indicators of solvency, results and value;\n- z thresholds for indicators relating to significant risks with a potential impact on strategic indicators (in particular, monitoring of interest rate risk, issuer risk and liquidity risk);\n- z thresholds  for  indicators  relating  to  operational  risks  and compliance;\n\nwhose  exceeding  leads  to  the  information  of  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Assurances' Board of Directors.\n\nLastly,  the  internal  operations  and  procedures  control  system aims at ensuring that the corrective measures decided upon are implemented within reasonable time limits. It also ensures that the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group's compensation policy and the associated internal controls have been implemented, in accordance with the measures relating to the compensation of executive managers and risk-takers within the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Group, as defined by regulations.\n\nWith regard to liquidity risk, and in accordance with regulations, the entities have developed specially adapted approaches, with the aim of measuring their capacity to handle shock situations likely to affect their cash position both in relation to their liabilities (increase in non-life insurance benefits, large-scale redemptions of life insurance contracts, etc.) and to their assets (occurrence of adverse market conditions).\n\n## Risks related to the effects of climate change\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group exposure to risks related to climate change consequences can be classified, according to the industry's drive, in physical risks and transition risks, knowing that induced liability risks (legal and reputation risks) are also likely to affect the Group.\n\nIn line with  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Group's  'Corporate  Social Responsibility' (CSR) approach and in accordance with a strategy presented to the Board of Directors, the CSR system is managed by the CSR manager within the Corporate Communication and CSR department, who reports directly to the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nDirect physical risks are, for instance, the destruction of goods caused by adverse climatic events such as hurricanes, floods or drought, the excess frequency of which can affect the technical results of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances property and casualty business and, besides, cause a decrease in the value of the investments affected by these risks. In its property and casualty insurance business, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is exposed, among other things, to catastrophe risk, particularly climate risk. The monitoring of this risk is integrated into the monitoring of technical insurance risks. Pacifica, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' property and casualty insurance subsidiary, has set up a system to monitor and follow-up these risks in order to contain exposure (quantification based on general scenarios simulations and monitoring of the climate burden compared to an annually revised",

Given such a  risk,  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  put  in  place  a  business continuity plan as described in the section 'Internal control system for  the  security  of  information  systems  and  business  continuity plans' below.\n\nThe transition to a green economy could, for instance, impact the business model of some investments and decrease their value. These new risks are taken into account by the Investments department of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances which integrates extra-financial criteria into the choice of issuers. Bond investments are subject to Amundi's 'Socially Responsible Investment' (SRI) filter. The issuers with the lowest ratings on these criteria are either excluded from investments or limited. Thus, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is continuing its  coal  policy  by  excluding  issuers  deriving  more  than  25%  of their turnover from coal mining or producing 100 million tonnes or more of coal per year. In addition, a policy to improve the energy performance of the real estate assets in the portfolio (materialised by obtaining a label) has been implemented. The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group also participates in discussions within the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Group  and  with  other  insurers  on  the  contribution  of financial investments to achieving the objectives of limiting global warming.\n\nThe impacts in terms of image and reputation could result from investments  in  activities  in  contradiction  with  environmental protection policies. The Compliance function works to protect the reputation of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group including in its investments.\n\nThe measures taken by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances to reduce climate risks by implementing a low-carbon strategy are developed in the section 'Economic, social and environmental Information'. The lowcarbon strategy includes in particular the reduction of the direct carbon  footprint  linked  to  the  operation  of  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Assurances  Group  (energy  consumption,  transport,  etc.).  Finally, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances adopted a code of conduct that includes a section on social, environmental and societal issues.\n\n## Permanent control system\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances permanent control system complies with the principle of subsidiarity defined by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Risk  Management  department.  Each  subsidiary  has  its  own permanent control system which is based on a set of core operational controls implemented by the business lines, under the supervision of agents dedicated exclusively to controls and of second-level controls implemented by agents dedicated exclusively to controls.\n\nWithin the entity's departments and services, procedures describe the processing to be implemented as well as related permanent operational  controls.  These  particularly  concern  the  accurate documentation  of  work  and  results,  compliance  with  policies, procedures and regulations, validation in line with the governance of each theme, and the monitoring of operational risks and of action plans.\n\nThe permanent control system has been implemented throughout the  Group  and  is  constantly  updated,  notably  when  there  are organisational  changes  and  when  new  activities,  projects  or regulations are implemented.\n\nWithin the context of the implementation of the revised Decree of 3  November 2014 on the internal control of companies in the banking sector, resources dedicated to last-line permanent control, independent of the operating units, working on all of the processes of the entity, are grouped together under the authority of the Risk Management Officer.\n\nWhere control points have not been incorporated into automatic processing systems (blocks on data entries, checks for consistency, etc.), they are defined with the aid of a risk map, which is updated on a yearly basis.\n\nThe results of the controls are formalised in check-lists and are the subject of summary reports for the attention of the Executive Management  within  the  context  of  the  Risk  Management  and Internal Control Committees. The heads of the control functions also receive the main reports issued by the Operating departments. Corrective plans of action are set up for any anomalies that these different methods detect.\n\n## Non-compliance risk control system\n\nThe aim of this system is to protect against risks of non-compliance with laws, regulations and internal standards and, in particular, to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, to  prevent  and  combat  fraud  and  corruption,  and  to  protect customers  and  personal  data.  Specific  means  of  managing  and monitoring operations were implemented: staff training, adoption of written internal rules, permanent compliance control, fulfilment of reporting obligations to supervisory authorities, etc.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's Compliance department is also in charge of regulatory projects. For example, the Compliance department supervised the deployment of GDPR (personal data protection), the corruption prevention part of the Sapin 2 law, and the OFAC remediation plan.\n\n## Internal control system for the security of information systems and business continuity plans\n\nThis system covers information systems and business continuity plans,  for  which  procedures  and  controls  aim  at  ensuring  a satisfactory level of security with regard to major risk scenarios (internal/external fraud, wide-scale virus attack, physical destruction of a production site, inaccessibility of a vital piece of software and its backup, etc.) approved by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Security Committee.\n\nSecurity  levels  are  measured  every  six  months  and  tests  are carried out on a regular basis. Plans are drawn up to improve any weaknesses.\n\nActions are taken to secure protection against cyber-attacks.\n\nThe  national  crisis  management  system  (in  which  the  entities participate through their designated correspondents) is tested every six months. A cyber crisis exercise is organised annually.\n\nA business continuity plan approach for the 'Insurance function', aimed  at  avoiding  the  'compartmentalisation'  effect  during  an\n\n1 5",

Thus, emergency tests are usually carried out on an annual basis by alternately simulating the loss of each of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole's two data centres in the Centre region.\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 crisis, and the massive deployment of remote working, the traditional SRU (User Fallback Site) system has been replaced by alternative solutions (strategic stock of PCs and increase in the capacity of the PC matrixing benches).\n\n## Internal control systems for accounting and financial information\n\n## Roles and responsibilities in the preparation and processing of financial information\n\nWithin the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, three functions are the main contributors in terms of preparing accounting and financial information for publication: Accounting, Management Control and Financial Communication, this information being mainly based on accounting data and management data.\n\nManagers  of  these  functions,  who  are  members  of  the  Finance department of the holding company and its subsidiaries, report to their line manager, the Chief Financial Officer, within their respective entities.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group holding company's role is to lead and coordinate the Finance Group function within insurance companies, its subsidiaries. It bases its IT standards and organisation on the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Group principles, which it adapts and supplements to meet the specific requirements of the insurance sector.\n\nEach subsidiary obtains the means to ensure the quality of the accounting  and  management  data  forwarded  to  the  holding company  for  consolidation  purposes.  Subsidiaries  must  comply with the following principles: compliance with current standards applicable in the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Group, consistency of the consolidated financial statements with parent company financial statements approved by its decision-making body, reconciliation of accounting and management reporting figures.\n\n## Accounting Data\n\nEach Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group entity has responsibility, towards the supervisory authorities to which it reports, for its own financial statements, which are approved by its decision-making body. Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances prepares its consolidated financial statements  in  accordance  with  current  accounting  standards applicable  in  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Group,  distributed  by  Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A.  and  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances'  Accounting  and Consolidation department.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances uses accounting and financial information systems which allow it to process data under satisfactory security conditions.\n\n## Management Data\n\nWhen data is not extracted directly from accounting information, the sources and definition of the calculation methods used are generally referred to so as to make the data easier to understand.\n\nManagement  data  mainly  comes  from  the  Management  Control function. It may also come from external sources of information ( France  Assureurs , L'Argus  de  l'assurance ),  particularly  for  the information relative to market shares. The management data used by Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances is subject to accounting controls (particularly for data covered by the application of IFRS 7) to ensure that this information is accurately reconciled with accounting data, as  well  as  compliance  with  management  standards  set  by  the executive body and the reliability of management data calculations.\n\nManagement  data  is  prepared  using  calculation  methods  and methodologies that ensure the comparability of figures over time.\n\n## Description of the permanent accounting, financial and prudential information control system\n\nAn Accounting Control Charter has been formalised within Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Assurances  Solutions  (Predica,  CACI,  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Assurances holding). It describes the general organisation of the control system, the roles and responsibilities of those conducting the controls and the way in which results are fed back.\n\nThe  permanent  control  of  accounting  and  financial  information (second-scale  control,  second  level),  carried  out  by  the  Risk Management function, aims to provide an independent view of the accounting and financial information production system on the basis of a risk-based approach by:\n\n- z exploiting recurring reports on the results of business controls following the closing of the accounts;\n- z carrying out thematic missions on subjects presenting risks.\n\nThe checks focus in particular on:\n\n- z compliance of data with legal and regulatory requirements and with the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group standards;\n- z reliability and fair representation of data, in order to give a true and fair view of the financial position of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its consolidation scope;\n- z security of data preparation and processing procedures, to limit operational risks and respect publication deadlines;\n- z prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nA risk mapping of accounting processes has been set up using a  harmonised  methodology  thanks  to  joint  development  work between the business lines, the shared permanent control teams and the accounting audit. It will be adapted to take into account the  changes  brought  about  by  the  implementation  of  the  new IFRS 17 standard. Accounting risks are integrated into the Group's alert procedure.",

It is supported by five dedicated teams in the subsidiaries in Italy, Poland, Spain, Portugal  and  Japan.  These  controls  are  independent  of  the operating units. So as to guarantee its independence, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances internal audit director reports hierarchically to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Control and Audit and functionally to the Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances. This dual reporting line falls within the operating logic of the Audit-Inspection function of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiaries.\n\nIn accordance with Solvency II requirements, the Board of Directors of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and the Boards of Directors of its insurance subsidiaries approved the appointment of a person\n\nresponsible for the Internal Audit key function at the Group level and its subsidiaries. The appointment was then approved by the competent national supervisory authority.\n\nThe annual audit plan was prepared using a risk-based approach. It is part of a five-year audit plan. It is based on a risk map updated on an annual basis. It is prepared by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Audit department in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and with the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Head of Control and Audit.

Control  and  Audit  function  provides  a second-level audit of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, within the context of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group risk map (critical issues, parent company's systematic audit coverage over the main Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group subsidiaries).\n\nControls are in proportion to the nature and intensity of the risks to which all the activities and entities within the consolidated scope of surveillance are exposed, both in terms of their frequency and the resources allocated.\n\nThey are conducted using formal methodologies, in line with the annual plan. They aim at ensuring compliance with external and internal rules, risk management, reliability and completeness of the information and risk measurement systems. They focus, in particular, on permanent control and compliance control systems, as well as the activities of the Actuarial function.\n\nThe smooth running of the audit plan is monitored by the Executive Management  of  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  and  by  the  Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group Control and Audit function. The Audit Director also systematically presents a summary of the findings of the published audits to the Risk Management and Internal Control Committee of the Group and its subsidiaries, as well as to the Audit Committees and, at least once a year, to the Boards of Directors.\n\nThe audits carried out by the Audit department, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Group Control and Audit function or any external audits (supervisory authorities)  are  monitored  through  a  formal  system.  For  every recommendation formulated as a result of these audits, this process ensures the effective implementation of corrective measures, by deadlines agreed with the entity's management at the end of the audit. If necessary, the Head of the Audit department will submit a statutory disclosure to the decision-making body as a result of this process.\n\nIn accordance with the organisational procedures common to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  Group  entities  and  described  above,  and  with  existing systems and procedures at Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances, the Board of Directors, the Executive Management and the relevant parts of the company are provided with detailed information on internal control and exposure to risks, areas of improvement achieved in this area and the status of any corrective measures adopted, as part of a continuous improvement approach.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group is also subject to insurance risks (presented in section 6, note 6.19.6.1  of the consolidated financial statements). Finally, it may be impacted by operational risks, in particular in the execution of its processes, non-compliance risks and legal risks.\n\n## 5.3.1 GOVERNANCE AND ORGANISATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE CR\u00c9 DIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCES GROUP\n\nThe risk governance system at the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is based on the following principles:\n\n- z it is part of the control system, which includes the 'Risk Management and Permanent Control' function, in charge of steering (supervision, prevention) and second-level control, the 'Internal Audit' function, in charge of periodic control, and the 'Compliance' function at Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. level. In addition to these functions, the Actuarial function at Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances level completes this system, in accordance with insurance company regulations;\n- z it is headed up by the Risk Management function of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, which manages the 'Risk' function, supervises the frameworks, and ensures, through Group standards and principles, the consistency of subsidiaries' risk management systems, supported by experts for each major risk category;\n- z it is based on the principle of subsidiarity. Each Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances  Group  entity  is  responsible  for  defining  and implementing its solo risk management policy, in accordance with Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. principles and rules, the principles and rules of management of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group, and local regulations for international subsidiaries.\n\nRisk governance is based on:\n\n- z the Executive Management, composed of the Chief Executive Officer and the second executive directors within the meaning of Solvency II, and the Board of Directors, ultimately responsible for the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's compliance with legal and regulatory provisions of all kinds;\n- z the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances, strategic body of the Executive Management, which relies on Group-level Committees (in particular the Risk and Internal Control Committee, the Strategic Financial, Plan, Budget and Results, Committee, the Strategic ALM and Investments Committee, the Strategic Reinsurance Committee);\n- z the four key functions (Risk, Compliance, Actuarial function, Internal Audit), whose representatives have been appointed by the Chief Executive Officer. Their appointment is validated by the Board of Directors and notified to the competent national supervisory authority. The coordination of the four key functions is ensured by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group Risk Management and Internal Control Committee. The heads of the key functions have a direct access to the Board of Directors to whom they introduce the results of their activity at least once a year;\n\n- z an internal control system, defined as the framework designed to manage and control all types of operations and risks and to ensure that all transactions are carried out in a manner that is proper (in compliance with regulations), secure and effective. Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances risks policies are validated by the Board of Directors;\n- z the internal process for evaluating the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's solvency and risks (ORSA), synchronised with other strategic processes MTP/Budget, Capital planning and the updating of the Risk and business policies framework. The forward-looking assessments, carried out within this framework, allow analysis of the consequences of adverse situations on the control indicators of the Group and take the necessary measures in case of need.\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe risks management framework of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is led by the director in charge of the Risk Management function, who reports functionally to Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' Chief Executive Officer and hierarchically to the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. They rely on the Risk Managers of each local entity reporting directly to them hierarchically, for the French entities, and functionally for the international entities. The Insurance Risk function is organised in a matrix structure integrating entity level organisation with Group approaches by type of risks.\n\nThe hierarchical business line reporting guarantees independence, with  a  'second  glance'  role  (to  issue  an  opinion)  to  back  the operating functions, which manage risks on a daily basis, make decisions and exercise first-level controls to ensure their processes are performed properly.\n\n## Risk management procedures\n\n## At the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group level\n\nTo carry out its strategic orientations, by managing and regulating its risks in a proper manner, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group has implemented a risk appetite framework which has to be observed.

Group Risk Management Committee (a sub-Committee of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A.'s Executive Committee,  chaired  by  its  Chief  Executive  Officer)  of  the  main indicators and limits.

Group is notified of any breaches of alert thresholds or limits and, when appropriate, the resulting corrective measures.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's quarterly risk dashboard, supplemented by monthly risk reporting, monitors changes in the Group's risk profile and identifies any deviations.\n\nThe Board of Directors is regularly informed about monitoring of compliance with the appetite framework.\n\nDedicated bodies ensure consistent risk management at Group level: a bimonthly Risk Monitoring Committee, a monthly Financial Risk Committee, portfolio reviews by type of assets, with news items presented monthly to the Executive Committee.\n\nMoreover,  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  set  up  a  group-wide Insurance Models Committee, steered by the Group Risk function. Its role is to approve the methodologies underpinning the models and indicators used to address major risks for the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances  Group  or  presenting  cross-sector  challenges  for  the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\n## 5.3.2 MARKET RISKS\n\nThis  section  deals  with  market  risk  on  financial  instruments. Information on market risk arising from contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS 17 is described in note 6.19.6.2 to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices ( e.g. interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices) will affect the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is exposed to several types of market risks:\n\n- z interest rate risk;\n- z price risk (including equity risks and risks known as diversification asset risks);\n- z foreign exchange risk.\n\nIn view of the predominance of savings activities in the French and international (Italy mainly) life insurance subsidiaries and, as a consequence, the very large volume of financial assets held to cover policyholder liabilities, the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group is particularly affected by market risks.\n\nThese risks impact the valuation of the assets in the portfolio, their long-term yield and are to be managed in close connection with the matching of liabilities.\n\n## At the entity level\n\nIn accordance with the Group framework, companies define their own risk monitoring and control systems: risk and process mapping, Risk  framework  implementing,  based  on  their  risk  appetite,  the Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group's  overall  limits  in  accordance with a process coordinated by the holding, taking into account, if necessary, limits intended to manage their specific risks.\n\nThe entities also draw up formal policies and procedures providing a strict framework for risk management (including the rules for accepting risk when insurance policies are taken out, provisioning and hedging of technical risks by reinsurance, claims management, etc.).\n\nFor its international subsidiaries, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances has drawn up a set of standards to be transposed by each entity, which sets out the scope and rules for decentralised decision-making.\n\nOperational  risk  management  is  supervised  in  each  entity  by Committees  that  meet  periodically  (investment,  ALM,  technical, reinsurance, etc.) to monitor developments in the risk position, based on reporting by business lines, to present analyses to support the risk management process, and, if necessary, to draw up proposals for action. Alerts are triggered if main incidents (and breaches of limits)  occurred  and  notified  either  to  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  S.A. Group Risk Management department (for certain Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances  Group  or  main  entity  limits),  or  to  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole Assurances  Executive  Management/the  entity's  management. Corrective measures are implemented in response.\n\nThe  risk  management  system  is  reviewed  during  the  Risk  and Internal Control Committees of each subsidiary, in the light of the results of ongoing controls, the analysis of their risk dashboards and the conclusions of periodic control missions.\n\nHence, the financial policy of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group includes  ALM  supervision  aimed  at  reconciling  the  objectives of  conserving  ALM  balances,  delivering  shareholder  value,  and seeking yield for policyholders. This supervision is based on 'risk/ yield'  analyses,  'stress  scenarios'  and  'risk  factor  sensitivity' analyses to identify the characteristics of the amounts to invest, the requirements and objectives over short/medium and long-term horizons, and a market analysis, supported by economic scenarios, to identify opportunities and limitations in terms of the environment and the markets.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' Investments department contributes to the development of the investment policies of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and of the subsidiaries (taking into account their individual ALM requirements and financial objectives), which are submitted to their respective Boards for approval, and monitors their  implementation  As  such,  it  is  responsible  for  oversight of  the  investment  management  services  provided  by  Amundi (management mandates entrusted by the companies). Moreover, it makes investments directly (without a mandate) on behalf of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group companies (in real estate and infrastructure in particular), as part of the policy of diversification.\n\n1 5",

The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's bond portfolio, excluding unit-linked contracts and UCITS, amounted to \u20ac190 billion at 31 December 2023 (in market value), compared with \u20ac184 billion at the end of 2022.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe management of interest rate risk requires a comprehensive approach combining financial strategy, reserve building, commercial policy  and  results.  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances'  framework  for managing interest rate risk sets out the limits on risks and the related governance (ALM Committee, presentation of stress scenarios to the Board of Directors, etc.).\n\nThus, Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances implements measures to manage the risk of a rate rise:\n\n- z adjustment of asset duration according to projected outflows of liabilities;\n- z retention of liquidities or liquid investments with a low risk of loss;\n- z dynamic investment portfolio management;\n- z derivative products hedging against a rise in rates.\n\nA context of low interest rates weighs on the profitability of the life-insurance activity of Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances: it leads to a situation where the yield on the securities entering the portfolio is lower than the rates served on life insurance contracts. Risks related to the minimum guaranteed returns in France are handled at regulatory level by means of prudential provisions.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances has a range of levers to tackle the risk of falling rates:\n\n- z hedges using bond assets and swaps/swaptions to manage reinvestment risk;\n- z adaptation to the very low rates environment of the assets/liabilities management and of the investments policies;\n- z prudent diversification of investment assets;\n- z adaptation of the sales policy, favouring inflows towards unit-linked contracts.\n\nWith regard to investments representative of unit-linked contracts (representing \u20ac94,362  million at 31  December 2023), the interest rate risk is significantly mitigated since it is mainly borne directly by policyholders.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Assurances  Group  dashboard,  presented  to  the Executive Committee, includes indicators to monitor the nature of this risk.\n\n## Analysis of the sensitivity to rate risk\n\nThe  table  presenting  the  impact  on   net  income  and  equity  of reasonably possible changes in interest rates at the closing date is presented in note 6.19.6.2  to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance.\n\n## Financing debt\n\nBorrowings  arranged  by  the  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group mainly pay fixed rates. Interest is therefore largely insensitive to rate changes.\n\n## 5.3.2.2    Price risk (including equity and  other assets known as diversification assets)\n\n## Nature of the exposure\n\nPrice risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, and that the fulfilment cash flows of an insurance or reinsurance contract, will fluctuate due to changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether due to factors specific to the instrument or contract in question or to its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded on the market or all similar contracts.\n\nThe Group's exposure to price risk concerns financial assets and financial liabilities whose values fluctuate due to changes in market prices, i.e. financial assets measured at fair value and insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWith regard to financial investments, exposure to equity markets and  other  so-called  diversification  assets  (private  equity  and listed and unlisted infrastructure, real estate and alternative asset management) makes it possible to capture the returns on these markets. Market risk on equities and other diversification assets is defined as volatility risk in terms of valuation. To limit this effect, particularly for the life insurance portfolios, allocations are analysed to determine a ceiling for the share of these diversification assets and  a  maximum  volatility  level.  With  regard  to  investments representative of unit-linked contracts (representing \u20ac94,362 million at 31 December 2023), the risk is significantly mitigated since it is mainly borne directly by policyholders.\n\nEquities and other diversification assets are held directly or via dedicated  Cr\u00e9 dit  Agricole  Assurances  Group  UCITS  to  provide regional diversification, in accordance with the relevant risk policies. Exposure to these assets is managed by a series of limits (by asset class and overall for the diversification) and concentration rules.\n\nCompliance with these limits is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\n## Analysis of sensitivity to equity risk\n\nThe  table  presenting  the  impact  on   net  income  and  equity  of reasonably  possible  changes  in  the  value  of  the  shares  at  the reporting date is presented in note  6.19.6.2  to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance.\n\n## 5.3.2.3    Foreign  exchange  risk\n\nThe foreign exchange risk may be defined as a risk of loss in relation with the fluctuations of the exchange rate of each currency compared to the euro. The Group is marginally exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Group's transactions are mainly carried out in euros.\n\nIts  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  comes  from  consolidated entities  whose  functional  currency  is  different  from  the  euro, and from transactions carried out by entities in currencies other than their functional currency. At Group level, such transactions",

In addition, the Group's financial assets are almost exclusively denominated in the same currencies as those in which its insurance contract liabilities are denominated.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances' exposure to foreign exchange risk falls into two categories:\n\n- z a limited structural exposure: in yen for the CA Life Japan subsidiary, with a coverage ratio of 93% (limited net exposure at \u20ac7.7 million at the end of 2023) and in PLN for the CA Zycie subsidiary with a coverage ratio of 84% (net exposure of \u20ac4.4 million at the end of 2023);\n- z operational foreign exchange exposure arises from a mismatch between the asset's currency and that of its liabilities: the Cr\u00e9 dit\n\nAgricole  Assurances  Group's  global  portfolio,  representing commitments in euros, is primarily invested in euro-denominated financial instruments. However, to achieve the aim of optimising risk/return and the search for diversification, the Group seeks to profit from projected gaps in growth and interest rate differentials between major regions, through dedicated funds or mandates relatives to investments in fixed income products. The general strategy is not to hedge exposure to the currencies of emerging economies, regardless of the asset class, and, in contrast, to hedge exposure to the currencies of mature countries, with the option of limited tactical exposure to the American dollar. The Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group's overall foreign exchange exposure is bound by a maximum market value limit relative to the total portfolio, and two sub-limits for emerging currencies and the American dollar.\n\n## 5.3.3 LIQUIDITY  RISK\n\nRegarding Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances, the liquidity risk corresponds mainly to its ability to meet its current liabilities.\n\nIt is presented in note 6.19.6.5 to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances presented in chapter 6 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 5.3.4 CREDIT  RISK\n\nThis section deals only with credit risk on financial instruments. Informations on credit risk  relating to contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS 17 are described in note 6.19.6.4  to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\nAmundi's  risk  management  teams  perform  the  analysis  of counterparty  risk  for  issuers  and  for  OTC  market  transactions (derivatives) under the mandates granted to them by the insurance companies.\n\nCounterparty risk is controlled, both at the global level of the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group and at the level of each entity's portfolios, through limits on ratings, issuer and sector concentrations.\n\nHence, limits are placed to manage the breakdown of issues between rating classes. The rating used is the so-called 'Solvency II' rating corresponding to the second best of the three Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch ratings. The proportion of 'high yield' issues held directly or through funds is strictly limited and only minimum BB issues are authorised for purchase in mandates. Issuers not rated by an external agency but with an internal rating from Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. are selected according to a rigorous process.\n\nThe breakdown of the bond portfolio by credit rating is a good indication of its creditworthiness.\n\nThe bond portfolio (excluding unit-linked contracts and UCITS) by credit rating breaks down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The bond portfolio is reviewed quarterly with the Amundi Risk teams and the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department.\n\nConcentrations on sovereign and assimilated debt are subject to individual limits according to the weight of the countries measured by their GDP and the internal credit rating of the sovereigns.\n\nExposure to the sovereign debt of Italy, Spain and Portugal is subject to authorisation by the Group Risk Management Committee of Cr\u00e9 dit\n\n## 5.3.5 UNDERWRITTING  RISK\n\nInformation  on  risks  arising  from   contracts  within  the  scope  of IFRS  17 is presented in note  6.19.6 'Risks arising from contracts within the scope of IFRS 17' in the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances .\n\n## 5.3.6 OPERATIONAL  RISKS\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from shortcomings or failure in internal procedures, human error, information systems or external events. It includes the risks generated by using outsourced services.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances entities apply the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole  S.A. Group directives on operational and compliance risk management.\n\nThe operational risk management system in each entity, including the holding, is thus comprised of the following components:\n\n- z mapping  of  risk  events,  periodically  updated  to  include organisational changes, new business and changes in the cost of risk. Mapping is constructed by breaking down activities by process, together with the seven risk categories according to Basel 2 nomenclature. Financial and extra-financial impacts (regulatory and image) of actual and potential risk events identified are assessed together with the probability of occurrence, drawing on business line experts. Internal control is assessed on the basis of the results of controls at the different levels defined in the local control plans and standardised controls defined by the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Management department and the findings of periodic controls to highlight the most critical net risks and prioritise action plans to reduce them;\n\nAgricole S.A. The holding of the Italian sovereign is concentrated at the level of the Italian subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances. The debt of Greek issuers remains prohibited for purchase.\n\nCash collateral contracts are used to manage counterparty risk for over-the-counter derivatives used by companies to hedge exposure to rate risk and presented on their balance sheets.\n\nWith regard to investments representative of unit-linked contracts (representing  \u20ac94,362  million  at  31  December  2023),  the  risk is  significantly  mitigated  since  it  is  mainly  borne  directly  by policyholders.\n\nIn addition, the table presenting the impact on CSM, net income and equity of reasonably possible changes in the main insurance risk variables at the reporting date ( i.e. mortality risk and the ultimate claims expense) is presented in note  6.19.6 to the consolidated financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurance.\n\n- z a process of collecting incidents and operating losses, backed by an early-warning system, is used to monitor identified risks and exploit them to introduce remediation measures and ensure consistency with mapping. The amount of collected losses is compared every quarter to a yearly defined alert threshold.\n\nCr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances and its subsidiaries have prepared a business continuity plan (BCP) focusing on essential activities in order to cover a failure of information systems, operational sites and  personnel.  The  business  continuity  plans  meet  the  Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group standards, with an IT back-up plan based on the Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole S.A. Group shared IT operating and production site. It is tested on a regular basis. IT system security is an inherent component of the Group's security policies. A three-year programme of security projects (including accreditation, intrusion tests, and deployment of IT system unavailability scenarios) is reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nA Cr\u00e9 dit Agricole Assurances Group-wide general subcontracting policy, describing amongst others the monitoring and control system associated with subcontracting, has been rolled out by Group entities. The outsourcing management framework was strengthened in 2021, following the publication of the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing, of revised Decree of 3 November 2014 and of the EIOPA Guidelines on Cloud Services outsourcing.",

The Group chose not to restate prior periods' figures to reflect\n\nsuch changes in designations and classifications. Thus, the Group recognised in the opening balance of equity at 1 January 2023 any difference between the previous carrying amount of those financial assets and the carrying amount of those financial assets at the date of initial application.\n\nThe  following  table  synthetises  the  measurement  category  and the  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  concerned,  determined immediately before and after applying the transition provisions of IFRS 17 about the redesignation of financial assets:\n\n|                                                                                                                      | 31/12/2022      | 01/01/2023 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   | 01/01/2023 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   | 01/01/2023 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial  assets (in \u20ac million)                                                                                     | Carrying amount | Financial assets  held for trading                                 | Equity instruments                                                 | Debt instruments  not fulfilling the  SPPI criteria                |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                                                | 181,500         | -

This approach was intended to address the temporary accounting consequences of the lag between the effective date of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018 and IFRS 17 on January 1, 2023. It made it possible to eliminate from the income statement some of the additional accounting mismatches and temporary volatility generated by the application of IFRS  9 before the entry into force of IFRS 17.",

Thus, it is not concerned by \u00a7C28A to C28E of these amendments. Moreover, it does not apply the option provided by \u00a7C33A of these amendments (classification overlay) for the purpose of presenting comparative information for financial assets derecognised between the transition date to IFRS 17 and the date of initial application of IFRS 17.\n- (2) No material effect at the Group level.\n\n## STANDARDS PUBLISHED BY THE IASB AND ADOPTED BY THE  EUROPEAN UNION AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4. It is mandatorily applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 as adopted by the European Union on 19 November 2021 includes an optional exemption from applying the requirements of the standard that relate to annual cohorts for intergenerationallymutualised and cash flow matched contracts.\n\nThe Group applied IFRS 17, as well as the amendments of IFRS 17 to other IFRS standards, for the first time in its financial statements from 1 January 2023. The main amendments to other IFRS standards that impact the Group are the amendments to IAS 28 and IAS 40, which allow the Group to measure at fair value through profit or loss participations in associates and joint ventures as well as investment property constituting underlying items of insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\nIFRS  17  has  to  be  applied  retrospectively,  with  mandatory restatement  of  comparative  information.  Therefore,  comparative information relating to the 2022 period is restated in the financial statements of the 2023 period, and a statement of financial position at the transition date (1 January 2022) is also presented.\n\nThe effects of the coming into force of IFRS 17 on the consolidated financial statements of the Group at 1 January 2022 are presented\n\nin  the  statement  of  changes  in  equity  as  well  as  in  the  note 'Impact on equity at 1 st January 2022 of the first application of the IFRS 17 standard' below.\n\nAdditional information about the methods used to determine the measurement of insurance contracts at the transition date, as well as the effect of the application of the modified retrospective approach on the CSM, insurance revenue and insurance finance income or expenses, is provided in the note 6.19.5 on transition amounts below.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement and presentation of the contracts within its scope ( i.e. insurance contracts issued,  reinsurance  contracts  issued  and  held,  and  investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued, provided the entity also issues insurance contracts), as well as requirements regarding disclosures about them.\n\nIts application will result in significant changes on these points. The  nature  and  the  effects  of  the  main  changes  in  accounting policies pertaining to the first application of IFRS 17 are summarised thereafter.\n\n## Changes to recognition and measurement\n\nThe  Group,  as  permitted  under  IFRS  4,  formerly  accounted  for insurance contracts in its consolidated financial statements applying French  accounting  standards,  except  for  specific  requirements introduced by IFRS 4 for equalisation reserves, shadow accounting and the liability adequacy test.\n\nThe standards and interpretations are the same as those applied and described in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group's financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThey have been supplemented by the IFRS standards as adopted by the European Union at 31 December 2023 and for which application is mandatory for the first time during financial year 2023.",

        "page_content": "These principles are no more applicable with the coming into effect of IFRS 17, which defines new principles for the measurement and recognition  of  insurance  contracts.  It  introduces  a  prospective general  measurement  model  for  insurance  contracts,  according to which groups of contracts are measured based on estimates of discounted future cash flows expected as insurance contracts services are provided, an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk, and a contractual service margin representing the unearned profit.\n\nIn summary, the application of the main requirements of IFRS 17 in respect of the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts consisted for the Group in:\n\n- z identifying insurance contracts as those under which it accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder;\n- z separating specified embedded derivatives, distinct investment components and distinct goods or services other than insurance contract services from insurance contracts and accounting for them in accordance with the other applicable standards;\n- z aggregating insurance contracts according to their features and expected profitability, which consists, at initial recognition, in identifying portfolios of insurance contracts (contracts subject to similar risks and managed together) then in dividing each of these portfolios into three groups (onerous contracts, contracts with no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, and other contracts), knowing that it is not possible to include contracts issued more than one year apart in the same group (except, on option, for intergenerationally-mutualised contracts and cash flow matched contracts, which are exempted from this requirement applying the European exemption);\n- z recognising  and  measuring  groups  of  contracts,  on  initial recognition, as the total of:\n- z fulfilment cash flows ( i.e. estimates of future cash flows, discounted in order to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks, and adjusted for non-financial risk, and that have to incorporate all available information consistently with observable market variables);\n- z and the contractual service margin (CSM), that represents the unearned profit that will be recognised in profit or loss as insurance contract services are provided to policyholders; if a group of contracts is expected to be onerous over the remaining coverage period, then a loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss;\n- z recognising and measuring groups of contracts, at the end of each subsequent reporting period, as the sum of:\n- z the liability for remaining coverage, comprising the fulfilment cash flows related to future service and the contractual service margin at that date;\n- z and the liability for incurred claims, comprising the fulfilment cash flows related to past service;\n- z recognising an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows in respect of acquisition cash flows paid, or incurred, before the related group of insurance contracts is recognised; such an asset is derecognised when these cash flows are included in the measurement of the related group of insurance contracts.\n\nThe general measurement model of contracts is adapted for certain contracts presenting specific features.\n\nThus, for insurance contract with direct participation features, the standard requires to apply a measurement model called 'variable fee approach' (VFA). These contracts, substantially, are investmentrelated  service  contracts,  under  which  an  entity  promises  an investment return based on underlying items. For these contracts, the  general  model  provisions  on  subsequent  measurement  are modified in order to reflect the fact that these contracts create an obligation for the entity to pay the policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of specified underlying items less a variable fee that remunerates the services provided and are determined in reference to the underlying items.\n\nMoreover, it is possible to apply a simplified measurement model, called 'premium allocation approach' (PAA), for the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage of a group of contracts, provided either this measurement does not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the provisions of the general model, or the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less. Using this approach, the liability for remaining coverage is measured as the amount of premiums received net of acquisition cash flows paid, less the net amount of premiums and acquisition cash flows that have been recognised in profit or loss over the expired portion of the coverage period based on the passage of time. This approach gets close to the accounting treatment applied under IFRS 4, the main changes relate to the discounting of technical provisions, the determination of onerous contracts at a more granular level and the introduction of a risk-adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nFrom now on, the Group measures at fair value through profit or loss, as permitted by the IAS  40 and IAS  28  standards amended by IFRS 17, investment property and participations in associates and joint ventures constituting underlying items of insurance contracts with  direct  participation  features,  in  order  to  avoid  accounting mismatches  with  the  measurement  of  this  type  of  insurance contracts under IFRS 17.\n\nThe principles relating to the accounting and the measurement of contracts within the scope of IFRS  17 are detailed in the section 'Accounting principles and policies' below.\n\n## Changes to presentation and disclosures\n\nApplying the requirements of IFRS  17 (and of IAS  1 as amended by IFRS 17) regarding the presentation of financial statements, the presentation of items relating to insurance contracts in the balance sheet, the income statement and the statement of net income and other  comprehensive  income,  experiences  significant  changes compared to the former presentation.\n\nThereby,  the  items  of  the  balance  sheet  in  which  the  various elements  relating  to  the  measurement  of  insurance  contracts under IFRS 4 were formerly accounted for are no longer presented (liabilities arising from contracts, reinsurers' share in liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, receivables and payables related  to  insurance  contracts  and  reinsurance  contracts  issued, receivables  and  payables  related  to  reinsurance  contracts  held, deferred  participation  assets  and  liabilities,  deferred  acquisition costs, value of purchased business in force).\n\n1 6",

They will become mandatory only as from the date decided by the European Union and have therefore not been applied by the Group at 31 December 2023.\n\n## IFRS IC DECISIONS, FINALISED AND APPROVED BY THE IASB THAT CAN AFFECT THE GROUP\n\nThe IFRS  IC published in October  2022 a decision regarding the measurement of multi-currency groups of insurance contracts, in answer to a request to the joint application of IAS 21 and IFRS 17 in measuring a group of insurance contracts with cash flows in more than one currency. In its decision, the IFRS IC especially observed that the IFRS 17 and IAS 21 standards refer to transactions or items that are denominated in a single currency, and include no explicit requirements on how to determine the currency denomination of transactions or items with cash flows in more than one currency. Consequently,  the  entity  should  develop  an  accounting  policy in accordance with IAS  8 to determine on initial recognition the currency or currencies in which such a group of insurance contracts (including the CSM) is denominated. Thus, two accounting methods may be applied (known as 'single-currency' or 'multi-currency'), which determines which effects of changes in exchange rates are changes in financial risk accounted for applying IFRS 17 and which of these effects are exchange differences accounted for applying IAS  21. Applying this decision, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group made  the  accounting  policy  choice  to  measure  multi-currency groups of insurance contracts according to the method known as single-currency denomination: thereby, changes arising from the translation of the currencies in which fulfilment cash flows of the group are denominated into the single currency in which the group is denominated are accounted for applying IFRS 17 (insurance finance income or expenses), and changes arising from the translation of the currency in which the group is denominated into the functional currency are accounted for applying IAS 21 (exchange differences).\n\nThe IFRS  IC published in October  2023 a decision regarding the measurement  of  premiums  receivable  from  an  intermediary, in answer to a request to the application by the insurer of the requirements in IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 to such premiums receivable, in the case when the policyholder has paid the premiums to the intermediary (thus discharging its obligation under the insurance contract) but the intermediary, who acts on behalf of the insurer, has not yet paid the premiums to the latter (who is nevertheless obliged to provide insurance contract services to the policyholder). In its decision, the IFRS IC especially observed that IFRS 17 is silent on the moment when future cash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract are removed from the measurement of the related group of  insurance  contracts.  Consequently,  the  entity  should  develop an accounting policy in accordance with IAS 8 to determine when these cash flows are removed from the measurement of a group of insurance contracts: either when these cash flows are recovered or settled in cash - in which case the measurement, presentation and disclosures requirements in IFRS 17 apply to premiums receivable from an intermediary (view 1), or when the policyholder's obligation under the insurance contract is discharged - in which case the requirements in IFRS 9 do apply to the same premiums receivable (view 2). Applying this decision, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group made  the  accounting  policy  choice  to  account  for  premiums receivable from an intermediary applying IFRS 9 in this scenario.",

This presentation, allowed under IAS 1, complies with the general principles of IFRS 17 which require that expenses directly attributable to insurance contracts be attached to the items\n\n## Accounting principles and policies\n\n## USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEstimates made to draw up the financial statements are by nature based on certain assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties as to whether they will be achieved in the future.\n\nFuture results may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\n- z activity in domestic and international financial markets;\n- z fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates;\n- z the economic and political climate in certain industries or countries;\n- z changes in regulations or legislation;\n- z the behaviour of the policyholders;\n- z demographic changes.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nAccounting estimates based on assumptions are principally used in the following assessments:\n\n- z financial instruments measured at fair value (including investments in non-consolidated companies);\n- z insurance contracts assets and liabilities;\n- z reinsurance contracts assets and liabilities;\n- z investment contracts without discretionary participation features liabilities;\n- z pension schemes and other post-employment benefits;\n- z stock option plans;\n- z impairment on debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that can be reclassified to profit or loss;\n- z provisions;\n- z impairment of goodwill;\n- z deferred tax assets.\n\nThe procedures for the use of judgements or estimates are detailed in the relevant sections below.\n\nof income and expenses relating to insurance activities. Information by nature is also provided in the notes.\n\nT he breakdown of management expenses by nature is presented according to the following items:\n\n- z personnel expenses;\n- z depreciation and amortisation expense;\n- z commissions;\n- z taxes;\n- z other.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all the amounts indicated in the financial statements are expressed in euros and are indicated in millions, without decimal. The round numbers to the nearest million euros may, in certain cases, lead to insignificant differences in the totals and subtotals appearing in the tables.\n\nIn  particular,  the  measurement  of  insurance  contracts  applying IFRS  17  requires  significant  judgements.  The  main  areas  of judgement for the application of the IFRS 17 standard by the Group are the following, and disclosures about them are developed in the sections and notes referred to below:\n\n- z the estimates of future cash flows, in particular the projection of these cash flows and the determination of the contract boundary: in the sections 'Measurement of insurance contracts / Estimates of future cash flows' and 'Measurement of insurance contracts / Contract boundary' of the accounting principles and policies;\n- z the technique used to determine the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk: in the section 'Measurement of insurance contracts / Risk adjustment for non-financial risk' of the accounting principles and policies;\n- z the approach used to determine discount rates: in the section 'Measurement of insurance contracts / Discount rates' of the accounting principles and policies;\n- z the definition of coverage units and the determination of the CSM amount allocated in profit or loss during each period in order to reflect insurance contract services: in the section 'Recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss' of the accounting principles and policies;\n- z the determination of transition amounts relating to groups of insurance contracts existing at the transition date: in the note 'Insurance and reinsurance contracts / Transition amounts'.\n\nAnnual  accounts  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  are  closed  on 31  December.  They  include  estimates  where  information  is  not available at the closing date. Financial investments are valued at closing prices and transactions carried out in the final month of the period having an impact on profit or loss are taken into account.\n\nAs an exception, a single entity within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group  is  closing  its  individual  accounts  on  a  date  other  than 31  December: CA Life Japan, whose closing date is 31 March. For this entity, 12  month-accounts are closed at 30  September to be consolidated in the Group accounts at 31 December. The impact from the difference in closing dates is not material.\n\n1 6",

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 16, the depreciable amount takes account of the potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nLand is recognised at its acquisition cost less any impairment losses.\n\nOperating property and investment property, as well as equipment, are recognised at their acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses since the time they were placed in service.\n\nPurchased  software  is  recognised  at  its  acquisition  cost  less accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses  since  the acquisition date.\n\nProprietary  software  is  recognised  at  its  production  cost  less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses since the date of completion.\n\nApart  from  software,  intangible  assets  comprise  mainly  assets acquired during a business combination resulting from contractual rights (e.g. distribution agreement). These were valued on the basis of the corresponding future economic benefits or expected service potential.\n\n## Operating property and investment property\n\nOperating property covers the buildings housing the company's services. Investment property covers rental property and shares in unlisted real estate companies.\n\nGenerally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group made the accounting policy choice, applying the provisions of IAS  16 and IAS  40, to measure operating property and investment property at cost.\n\nAs an exception, as allowed under IAS 40, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group made the accounting policy choice, to measure at fair value through profit or loss investment property that constitute underlying items of insurance contracts with direct participation features and of investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nProperties recognised at cost are analysed into four components, each with its own useful life and renewal schedule:\n\n- z structural works (superstructure and infrastructure);\n- z non-structural works (roofing, coverings, frames, facades, external joinery);\n- z technical installations (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lifts, electrical systems);\n- z fixtures and fittings (surfacing, wall and floor finishing stages, etc. ).\n\nTechnical studies carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances lead it to use a residual value corresponding to approximately 90% of the major works component. By definition, this residual value is not depreciated; however, if an item of major works were to suffer a significant and lasting loss of value (technological change, change of use, fall in price), an impairment would be recognised.\n\n## Depreciation and impairment\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are depreciated based on their estimated useful life.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods are used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group applying the component method of  accounting  for  property,  plant  and  equipment.  It  should  be clarified that these depreciation periods are adapted to the nature and the location of the property:\n\n| Component               | Depreciation period   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Land                    | Non depreciable       |\n| Structural works        | 30 to 80 years        |\n| Secondary works         | 8 to 40 years         |\n| Technical Installations | 5 to 25 years         |\n| Fixtures and fittings   | 5 to 15 years         |\n| IT equipment            | 4 to 7 years          |\n| Specialist equipment    | 4 to 5 years          |\n\nIf the net carrying amount of the asset is greater than the recoverable amount,  an  additional  impairment  is  recognised  further  to  its depreciation. The recoverable value, calculated where the property presents indicators of a loss of value, is the lower of fair value and value in use.\n\nFor buildings, fair value corresponds to a market value, established on the basis of a five-yearly valuation updated annually. This value is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements (see note 6.3).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances analyses at each closing all indicators of a loss of value for investment property measured at cost. This multicriteria analysis is based both on the long-term character of the loss of value and the exercise of judgment. One of the criteria taken into account is a net carrying amount more than 20% higher than the fair value, however, if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances considers selling the investment in the short term or does not have the ability to hold it in the long term, any impairment, even less than 20%, is recognised.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (IFRS 9, IFRS 13, IAS 32 AND IAS 39)\n\n## Definitions\n\nIAS 32 defines a financial instrument as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity, meaning any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to receive or pay cash or other financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are treated in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS  9 as adopted by the European Union, including for financial assets held by the Group's insurance entities.\n\nDerivative instruments are financial assets or liabilities whose value changes according to that of an underlying asset (provided that, in the case of a non-financial variable, this variable is not specific to any party to the contract), which requires a low or nil initial investment, and for which settlement occurs at a future date.\n\nIFRS  9  sets  the  principles  governing  the  classification  and measurement  of  financial  instruments,  impairment  /provisioning of credit risk and hedging accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.",

        "page_content": "It should nevertheless be noted that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has opted not to apply the IFRS 9 general hedging model. All hedging relationships  consequently  remain  within  the  scope  of  IAS  39 pending future provisions relating to macro-hedging.\n\nThe financial assets known as 'green' or 'ESG' comprise a variety of  instruments,  including  instruments  to  finance  environmental projects or ecological transition. It should be noted that not  all financial instruments with these qualifications necessarily have a remuneration that varies according to ESG criteria. This terminology is likely to evolve according to future European regulations related to sustainable finance. These instruments are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 using the principles set out below. In particular, loans whose indexation of the remuneration of the ESG criterion does not introduce a leverage effect or is considered immaterial in terms of variability of the cash flows of the instrument are not considered as failing the SPPI test on the basis of this single criterion.\n\nAs part of its Post-implementation Review  (PIR) of the IFRS 9 standard, the IASB decided, in May 2022, to initiate works to amend the IFRS 9 standard in order to clarify the terms of application of the SPPI test to this type of financial assets. An exposure draft was published in March 2023 and the comment period was open until July 19, 2023. The IASB plans to publish an amendment to IFRS 9 in 2024, which will then be submitted to the European Union adoption process.\n\n## Conventions for measuring financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nAt initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as defined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair value as defined by IFRS  13 corresponds to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to their classification either at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (EIR) for debt instruments, or at fair value as defined by IFRS 13. Derivative instruments are always measured at their fair value.\n\nAmortised cost corresponds to the amount at which the financial asset  or  liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  including transaction costs directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, reduced by repayments of principal, increased or reduced by the cumulative amortisation calculated by the effective interest rate method (EIR) on any difference (discount or premium) between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a financial asset at amortized cost or at fair value through recyclable OCI, the amount can be adjusted if necessary for impairment (see section 'Impairment/provisions for credit risks' below).\n\nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to obtain the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative  financial  assets  (debt  or  equity  instruments)  are classified  on  the  balance  sheet  in  accounting  categories  that determine  their  accounting  treatment  and  their  subsequent valuation mode.\n\nThe criteria for classification and measurement of financial assets depend on the nature of the financial asset, according to whether it is qualified as:\n\n- z a debt instrument ( e.g. loans and fixed or determinable income securities); or\n- z an equity instrument ( e.g. shares).\n\nThese financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- z financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- z financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (that may be reclassified to profit or loss for debt instruments, that cannot be reclassified for equity instruments).\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe classification and measurement of a debt instrument depend on the combination of two criteria: the business model defined at portfolio level, and the analysis of the contractual terms performed for each debt instrument, unless the fair value option is used.\n\n## The three business models:\n\nThe  business  model  represents  the  strategy  followed  by  the management  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  for  managing  its financial assets in order to achieve its objectives. The business model is specified for a portfolio of assets and does not constitute a caseby-case intention for an isolated financial asset.\n\nThe three business models are as follows:\n\n- z the hold to collect model for which the aim is to collect contractual cash flows over the lifetime of the assets; this model does not always imply holding all of the assets until their contractual maturity; however, sales of assets are strictly governed;\n- z the hold to collect and sell model where the aim is to collect the contractual cash flows over the lifetime of the assets and to sell the assets; under this model, both the sale of the financial assets and the receipt of cash flows are essential; and\n- z the other/sell model, where the main aim is to sell the assets. It notably concerns portfolios where the aim is to collect cash flows via sales, portfolios whose performance is assessed based on fair value, and portfolios of financial assets held for trading.\n\nWhen management's strategy for managing financial assets does not correspond to either the collect model or the collect and sell model, these financial assets are classified in a portfolio whose management model is other/sell.\n\n## The contractual terms ('Solely Payments of Principal & Interest' or 'SPPI' test):\n\nThe 'SPPI' test combines a set of criteria, examined cumulatively, to establish whether contractual cash flows meet the characteristics of a simple financing (principal repayments and interest payments on the remaining amount of principal due).\n\n1 6",

This additional analysis consists of comparing the contractual cash flows of the asset under review with the cash flows of a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the difference between the cash flows of the financial asset and the benchmark asset is considered immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing.\n\n## BUSINESS MODEL\n\n|      | HOLD TO COLLECT                    | HOLD TO COLLECT AND SELL                                                                    | OTHER/SELL                                        |\n|------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| PASS | Amortised cost                     | Fair value through other  comprehensive income that  may be reclassified  to profit or loss | Fair value through profit or loss (Test SPPI N/A) |\n| FAIL | Fair value through  profit or loss | Fair value through  profit or loss                                                          | Fair value through profit or loss (Test SPPI N/A) |\n\n## Debt instruments at amortised cost\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortised cost if they are eligible for the collect model and if they pass the 'SPPI' test.\n\nThey  are  recorded  at  the  settlement  date  and  their  initial measurement also includes accrued interest and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs of loans and receivables and of fixed-income securities is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThis category of financial instruments is adjusted for expected credit losses (ECL) under the conditions described in the specific section 'Impairment/Provisions for credit risks'.\n\n## Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified)\n\nLes instruments de dette sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 la juste valeur par capitaux Debt  instruments  are  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income on items that can be reclassified if they are eligible for the hold to collect and sell model and if they pass the 'SPPI' test.\n\nThey are recorded at the trade date and their initial measurement also includes accrued interest and transaction costs.\n\nAmortisation of any premium or discount and transaction costs on fixed-income securities is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThese financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income on items that can be reclassified and offset against the outstanding\n\naccounts (excluding accrued interest recognised in profit or loss according to the effective interest rate method).\n\nIf the securities are sold, these changes are transferred to profit or loss.\n\nThis category of financial instruments is subject to adjustments for expected credit losses (ECL) under the conditions described in the specific paragraph 'Impairment/Provisions for credit risks' (without this affecting the fair value on the balance sheet assets).\n\n## Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nDebt instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss in the following cases:\n\n- z the instruments are classified in portfolios composed of financial assets held for trading or for which the main objective is disposal. Financial assets held for trading are assets acquired or generated by the entity primarily with the aim of disposal in the short term or which are included in a portfolio of financial instruments managed as a unit and with the purpose of making a profit from short-term price fluctuations or an arbitrage margin. Although contractual cash flows are received during the period that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances holds the assets, the collection of these contractual cash flows is not essential but ancillary;\n- z debt instruments that do not fulfil the criteria of the 'SPPI' test. This is notably the case of UCITS;\n- z financial instruments classified in portfolios which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances designates at fair value in order to reduce an accounting treatment difference in profit or loss. In this case, the instrument is classified as designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nMoreover, a specific analysis is carried out when the financial asset is issued by special purpose entities establishing a differentiated order of payment among the holders of the financial assets by contractually linking multiple instruments and creating concentrations of credit risk ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is assigned a rank of subordination that specifies the order of distribution of cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn this case, the 'SPPI' test requires an analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset concerned and underlying assets according to the 'look-through' approach and the credit risk borne by the tranches subscribed compared to the credit risk of the underlying assets.\n\nThe mode of recognition of debt instruments resulting from the qualification of the business model combined with the 'SPPI' test may be presented in the following diagram:",

Equity instruments held for trading are recorded at the trade date. Equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and not held for trading are recorded at the settlement-delivery date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, offset against the outstanding accounts.\n\nThis category of financial assets is not subject to impairment.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified (irrevocable option)\n\nThe  irrevocable  option  to  recognise  equity  instruments  at  fair value through other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified is adopted at the transactional level (line by line) and applies at the date of initial recognition. These securities are recorded at the trade date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nAt subsequent measurement, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income on items that cannot be reclassified. In case of disposal, these changes are not reclassified to profit or loss. The gain or loss on disposal is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised in profit or loss if:\n\n- z the entity's right to receive payment is established;\n- z it is likely that the economic advantages associated with dividends will go to the entity;\n- z the amount of dividends can be reliably estimated.\n\nThis category of financial assets is not subject to impairment.\n\n## Reclassification of financial assets\n\nIn the case of a significant change in the business model used for managing  financial  assets  (new  activity,  acquisition  of  entities, disposal or discontinuation of a significant activity), a reclassification\n\nof these financial assets is necessary. The reclassification applies to all financial assets in the portfolio from the date of reclassification.\n\nIn other cases, the business model remains unchanged for existing financial assets. If a new business model is identified, it applies prospectively to new financial assets grouped in a new management portfolio.\n\n## Temporary acquisition and disposal of securities\n\nTemporary  disposals  of  securities  (loans  of  securities,  securities delivered under repurchase agreements) do not generally fulfil the conditions for derecognition.\n\nSecurities  lent  or  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  remain  on the balance sheet. In the case of securities sold under repurchase agreements, the amount received, representing the liability to the transferee, is recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by the transferor.\n\nSecurities borrowed or received under repurchase agreements are not recognised on the balance sheet of the transferee.\n\nIn the case of securities purchased under resale agreements, a debt to the transferor is recorded on the balance sheet of the transferee and offset against the amount paid. If the security is subsequently resold, the transferee records a liability equivalent to the fair value of fulfilling its obligation to return the security received under the agreement.\n\nRevenue and expenses relating to such transactions are posted to profit and loss on a prorata temporis basis, except in the case of a classification of assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or group of financial assets) is fully or partially derecognised if:\n\n- z the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;\n- z or are transferred or deemed as such because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries, and when substantially all the risks and rewards related to the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, all the rights or obligations created or retained at the time of transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred but only some of the risks and rewards, as well as control, are retained, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances continues to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in this asset.\n\nFinancial assets renegotiated for commercial reasons if there are no financial difficulties facing the counterparty and with the aim of developing or maintaining a business relationship are derecognised on the renegotiation date. The new loans granted to clients are recorded at their fair value on the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition depends on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n## Impairment/provisions for credit risks\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) on the following outstanding:\n\n- z financial assets of debt instruments at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified) (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- z financing commitments which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n\n1 6",

Subsequently, if the conditions for classifying financial instruments in Stage 3 are no longer met, the financial instruments are reclassified in Stage 2, then in Stage 1 according to the subsequent improvement in the quality of credit risk.\n\nA loan in default (Stage 3) is said to be impaired when one or more events have occurred that have an adverse effect on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired include observable data about the following events:\n\n- z significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;\n- z a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\n- z the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;\n- z it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;\n- z the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or\n- z the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.\n\nIt may not be possible to identify a single discrete event - instead, the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired.\n\n## Definition of expected credit losses ('ECLs')\n\nECL is defined as the weighted expected probable value of the discounted  credit  loss  (principal  and  interest).  It  represents  the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows and the expected cash flows (including principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach is designed to anticipate as early as possible the recognition of expected credit losses.\n\n## ECL governance and measurement\n\nThe Group's Risk Management department is responsible for defining the  methodological  framework  and  supervising  the  impairment system.\n\nThe Group primarily relies on the internal rating system to generate the IFRS 9 parameters required to calculate ECLs. The assessment of the change in credit risk is based on an expected loss model and extrapolation based on reasonable scenarios. All information that is available, relevant, reasonable and justifiable, including of a forwardlooking nature, must be retained.\n\nThe calculation formula includes the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default parameters.\n\nECLs are calculated according to the type of product concerned, i.e. financial instruments and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit losses (Stage 1) make up a percentage of the lifetime expected credit losses (Stage 2 and 3), and represent the lifetime cash flow shortfalls in the event of a default during the 12 months following the end of the reporting period (or a shorter period if the expected lifetime of the financial instrument is less than 12 months), weighted by the probability of default within the 12 months.\n\nExpected credit losses are discounted at the effective interest rate used for the initial recognition of the financial instrument.\n\nThe terms of measurement of ECLs include collateral and other credit enhancements that are part of the contractual terms and which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances does not account for separately. The estimate of the expected cash flow shortfalls from a guaranteed financial instrument reflects the amount and timing of the recovery of  the  guarantees.  In  accordance  with  IFRS  9,  the  inclusion  of guarantees  and  sureties  does  not  affect  the  assessment  of  the significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on the evolution of the debtor's credit risk without taking into account guarantees.\n\nForward-looking macroeconomic data are taken into account in accordance with a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- z at Group level for the determination of a shared framework for the consideration of forward-looking data in the estimation of probability of default and loss given default parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- z at the level of each entity in respect of its own portfolios.\n\n## Significant deterioration of credit risk\n\nAll Group entities must assess, for each financial instrument, the increase in credit risk from initial recognition at each reporting date. This assessment of the change in credit risk leads the entities to classify their exposures into different risk categories (Stages).\n\nTo assess significant increase, the Group uses a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- z the first level is based on relative and absolute Group criteria and rules that apply to all Group entities;\n- z the second level is linked to the expert assessment, based on local forward-looking information, of the risk held by each entity in its portfolios that may lead to an adjustment in the Group Stage 2 reclassification criteria (switching a portfolio or sub-portfolio to lifetime ECLs).",

        "page_content": "For securities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses an approach that consists in applying an absolute level of credit risk, in accordance with IFRS  9, below which exposures are classified in Stage  1 and impaired based on 12-month ECLs.\n\nAs such, the following rules shall apply for monitoring the significant increase of securities:\n\n- z 'Investment Grade' rated securities, at the reporting date, are classified in Stage 1 and provisions are made based on 12-month ECL;\n- z 'Non-Investment Grade' rated securities, at the reporting date, must be subject to monitoring for significant increase, since origination, and be classified in Stage 2 (lifetime ECLs) in the event of significant increase in credit risk.\n\nRelative increase must be assessed prior to the occurrence of an actual default (Stage 3).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivative instruments are financial assets or liabilities classified by default as derivative instruments held-for-trading unless they qualify for being hedging derivatives.\n\nThey are recorded on the balance sheet at their initial fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently recognised at their fair value.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the counterparty of the change in fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- z through profit or loss for derivative instruments held-for-trading and for fair value hedges;\n- z through other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss for cash flow hedging derivatives and net investments in foreign operations for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n## General framework\n\nIn accordance with a decision made by the Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances does not apply the 'hedge accounting' provisions of IFRS 9, as permitted by the standard. All hedging relationships will continue to be documented in accordance with the rules of IAS 39 until, at the latest, the date on which the text on macro-hedging is adopted by the European Union. However, the eligibility of financial instruments to hedge accounting under IAS 39 takes into account the IFRS  9 principles for the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nUnder  IFRS  9,  and  given  the  IAS  39  hedging  principles,  debt instruments  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) are eligible to fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging relationships must comply with the following principles:\n\n- z fair value hedges are intended to provide protection from exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability that has been recognised, or of a firm commitment that has not been recognised, attributable to the risk(s) hedged and that may have an impact in profit or loss (for instance, the hedging of all or some changes in fair value caused by the interest rate risk of a fixed-rate debt);\n- z cash flow hedges are intended to provide protection from exposure to changes in the future cash flows of an asset or liability that\n\nhas been recognised, or of a transaction considered to be highly probable, attributable to the risk(s) hedged and that could (in the event of a planned transaction not carried out) have an impact in profit or loss (for instance, the hedging of changes in all or some of the future interest payments on a floating-rate debt);\n\n- z net investment hedges in foreign operations are intended to provide protection against the risk of unfavourable changes in fair value associated with the foreign exchange risk of an investment carried out abroad in a currency other than the euro, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances' presentation currency.\n\nHedges must also meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for hedge accounting:\n\n- z the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be eligible;\n- z there must be formal documentation from inception, primarily including the individual designation and characteristics of the hedged item, the hedging instrument, the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged risk;\n- z the effectiveness of the hedge must be demonstrated, at inception and retrospectively, by testing performed at each reporting date.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe re-measurement of the derivative at fair value is recorded in the financial statements as follows:\n\n- z fair value hedge: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ineffective portion of the hedge appears in profit or loss;\n- z cash  flow  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is recognised in the balance sheet against a specific account in other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) for the effective portion, and any eventual ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss. Profits or losses on the derivative accumulated in other comprehensive income are then reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- z net investment hedge in a foreign operation: the change in value of the derivative is recognised in the balance sheet against a translation adjustment account in other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified) and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhere the conditions for benefiting from hedge accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively,  except  in  case  of  disappearance  of  the  hedged element:\n\n- z fair value hedge: only the derivative instrument continues to be revalued through profit or loss. The hedged item is wholly accounted for according to its classification. For debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (items that may be reclassified), changes in fair value subsequent to the ending of the hedging relationship are recorded in other comprehensive income in their entirety. For hedged items valued at amortised cost, which were interest rate hedged, the revaluation adjustment is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- z cash flow hedge: the hedging instrument is measured, excluding accrued and paid interests, at fair value through profit or loss. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge remain in other comprehensive income until the hedged flows of the hedged item affect profit or loss. For interest rate hedged instruments, profit or loss is affected as interests are paid. In practice, the revaluation adjustment is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n\n1 6",

Profit or loss is affected when the net investment in a foreign operation exits the scope of consolidation.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn embedded derivative is the component of a hybrid contract that meets the definition of a derivative product. This definition applies only to financial liabilities and non-financial contracts. The embedded derivative must be accounted for separately from the host contract if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- z the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- z the embedded component taken separately from the host contract has the characteristics of a derivative;\n- z the characteristics of the derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract.\n\nThe  main  hybrid  financial  investments  held  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances at 31 December 2023 are some EMTN and convertible bonds. If the characteristics of the derivative are not closely linked to those of the host contract, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has elected to recognise these instruments at fair value through profit or loss, their embedded derivatives are thus not accounted for separately.\n\n## Determination of the fair value of financial instruments\n\nWhen determining the fair value of financial instruments, observable inputs must be prioritised. This fair value is presented using the hierarchy defined in IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants, on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the measurement date.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances considers that the best evidence of fair value is reference to quoted prices published in an active market.\n\nWhen such quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined using  valuation  techniques  that  maximise  the  use  of  relevant observable data and minimise the use of unobservable data.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe standard classifies fair value into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in the evaluation.\n\n## Level 1: fair value corresponding to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  and  liabilities  that  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances can access at the measurement date. These are, notably, stocks and bonds quoted in active markets, fund securities quoted in an active market and derivatives traded on an organised market, in particular futures.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from a stock exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level 1\n\nThe  inputs  used  are  observable  either  directly  ( i.e. prices)  or indirectly (derived from prices) and generally consist of data from outside Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, which are publicly available or accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\nLevel 2 is composed of:\n\n- z stocks and bonds quoted in an inactive market or not quoted in an active market but for which the fair value is established using a valuation methodology usually used by market participants (such as discounted cash flow techniques or the Black & Scholes model) and based on observable market data;\n- z instruments that are traded over the counter, the fair value of which is measured with models using observable market data, i.e. derived from various independently available external sources which can be obtained on a regular basis. For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally derived from the yield curves of market interest rates as observed at the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are based notably on standard models and observable market data (such as interest rate yield curves or implied volatility surfaces), the day one gain or loss resulting from the initial fair value measurement of the related instruments is recognised in profit or loss at inception.\n\n## Level 3: fair value that is measured using significant unobservable inputs\n\nFor some complex market instruments that are not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques using assumptions that cannot be observed on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are disclosed within Level 3.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances mainly classifies within Level 3 units in venture capital funds and unlisted equity securities.\n\nValuation methodologies and models used for financial instruments that are disclosed within Levels 2 and 3 incorporate all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price. They shall be beforehand validated by an independent control. The fair value measurement of these instruments notably includes liquidity risk and counterparty risk.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIn accordance with IAS  32, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances offsets a financial asset and a financial liability and reports the net amount when, and only when, it has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts reported and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nThe derivative instruments and the repurchase agreements handled with clearing houses that meet the two criteria required by IAS 32 are subject to offsetting on the balance sheet.\n\n## Investment income net of investment expenses\n\nThis heading of the income statement includes all the income and expenses linked to the investments of insurance companies. It is detailed as follows.",

They are, however, subject to impairment for credit risk in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9.\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract under which the issuer must make specific payments to reimburse the holder for a loss incurred due to a specific debtor's failure to make a payment when due under the initial or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value then subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- z the amount of the loss allowance for expected credit losses determined in accordance with the provisions of the 'Impairment' section of IFRS 9; or\n- z the amount originally recognised less, where applicable, the sum of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## INSURANCE CONTRACTS (IFRS 17)\n\n## Definition and classification of contracts\n\nThe  contracts  issued  by  the  Group  fall  into  the  two  following categories:\n\n- z insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) issued, that fall within the scope of IFRS 17;\n- z investment contracts that fall within the scope either of IFRS 17 or IFRS 9 depending on whether they are contracts with or without discretionary participation features.\n\nThe reinsurance contracts held by the entities of the Group also fall within the scope of IFRS 17.\n\nAll  references  hereunder  to  insurance  contracts  also  apply  to investments contracts with discretionary participation features and reinsurance contracts held, except where explicitly specified.\n\nInsurance contracts may be issued by the Group, or acquired in a business combination or in a transfer of insurance contracts that do not form a business. All references hereunder to insurance contracts issued also apply to contracts acquired, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nAn insurance contract is a contract under which one party (the issuer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder)  by  agreeing  to  compensate  the  policyholder  if  a specified  uncertain  future  event  (the  insured  event)  adversely affects the policyholder.\n\nA reinsurance contract is an insurance contract issued by one entity (the  reinsurer)  to  compensate  another  entity  for  claims  arising from one or more insurance contracts issued by that other entity (underlying contracts).\n\nInsurance  and  reinsurance  contracts  also  expose  the  Group  to financial risk.\n\nInsurance risk is the risk, other than financial risk, transferred from the holder of a contract to the issuer. Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, currency exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.\n\nIn the Group, for each portfolio of contracts aggregated according to homogeneous characteristics, the significance of the insurance risk is assessed on the basis of a representative individual contract.

Insurance risk may therefore be significant whereas the principle of pooling of risks within the portfolio limits the likelihood of  a  significant  loss  with  respect  to  the  result  of  the  portfolio considered as a whole.\n\nThe main insurance risks are related to mortality (death benefits), longevity (life benefits, such as life-contingent annuities), morbidity (temporary disability benefits), permanent disability, health (medical benefits), unemployment, or third-party liability and property and casualty.\n\nApplying  the  principles  of  IFRS  17,  insurance  contracts  may  be classified as insurance contracts with direct participation features or insurance contracts without direct participation features.\n\nInsurance contracts with direct participation features are insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts under which an entity promises an investment return based on underlying items. Hence, they are defined as insurance contracts for which, at inception:\n\n- z the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- z the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n- z the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThe assessment of whether these three conditions are met shall be performed at inception of the contract and shall not be reviewed afterwards, unless the contract is substantially modified.\n\nAll other insurance contracts issued and all reinsurance contracts (issued and held) are classified as insurance contracts without direct participation features.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nContracts that do not expose the insurer to a significant insurance risk are investment contracts. They include investment contracts with discretionary participation features and investment contracts without discretionary participation features.\n\nAn investment contract with discretionary participation features is defined as a financial instrument that provides a particular investor with the contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of the issuer, additional amounts:\n\n- z that are expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;\n- z the timing or amount of which are contractually at the discretion of the issuer; and\n- z that are contractually based on:\n- z the returns on a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contracts;\n- z realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer;  or\n- z the profit or loss of the entity or fund that issues the contracts.\n\nInvestment  contracts  with  discretionary  participation  features encompass mainly euro-denominated savings contracts. In the case of multi-funds contracts, insofar as the policyholder has the option,\n\nat any time, to opt for a transfer of all or part of his savings to a eurodenominated fund with discretionary participation features (under conditions that are not likely to impede such arbitrages), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group considers that the contract as a whole is a contract with discretionary participation features, whether the option has been exercised or not by the policyholder.\n\nInvestments contracts that do not meet the former definition are investments contracts without discretionary participation features, they fall within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\n## Recognition of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\n## Separating components of an insurance contract\n\nAt inception, the Group separates embedded derivatives, distinct investment  components  and  any  promise  to  transfer  to  the policyholder distinct goods or services other than insurance contract services, and accounts for them as stand-alone components applying the relevant IFRS standards.\n\nOnce these distinct stand-alone components have been separated, the  Group  applies  IFRS  17  to  account  for  all  the  remaining components in the insurance contract.\n\n## Level of aggregation of insurance contracts\n\nThe provisions of the standard relating to the level of aggregation require to group contracts into portfolios of contracts, then to divide the latter into three groups depending on the expected profitability of the contracts at initial recognition, themselves shall not include contracts  issued  more  than  one  year  apart  ( i.e. annual  cohorts principle).\n\nA portfolio of insurance contracts comprises insurance contracts that are subject to similar risks and managed together.\n\nEach portfolio should be divided into at least the following groups:\n\n- z a group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, if any;\n- z a group of contracts that, at initial recognition, have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, if any;\n- z a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any.\n\nThese groups represent the level of aggregation at which insurance contracts are initially measured and recognised.\n\nIn order to apply the general principles of the standard with respect to identifying portfolios, the Group proceeded to various analyses depending on the guarantees identified and the way contracts are managed (e.g. depending on the financial portfolios related to the saving-pension products, depending on the applied level for the prospective  measurement  of  risks  and  solvency  as  regards  risk products, or depending on business lines for property and casualty products). The division of the portfolios into groups according to the expected profitability was carried out based on various information such as the pricing of contracts, the history of profitability of similar contracts, or prospective plans.\n\nAs  permitted  by  article  2  of  the  regulation  (UE)  2021-2036  of 19  November 2021 of the European Commission, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  Group  has  chosen  to  resort  to  the  exemption  from applying the annual cohort requirements for intergenerationallymutualised contracts. This accounting policy choice has been applied to portfolios corresponding to the savings and pensions businesses of the Group that are eligible for the exemption.\n\nThe Group does not apply the requirements of the standard that allow to include in the same group contracts that would fall into different  groups  only  because  law  or  regulation  specifically",

        "page_content": "constrains the Group's practical ability to set a different price or level of benefits for policyholders with different characteristics.\n\n## Date of recognition of insurance contracts\n\nA group of insurance contracts issued shall be recognised from the earliest of the following:\n\n- z the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts;\n- z the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due or, when no due date exists, the date when the first payment is received; and\n- z for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.\n\nOnly the contracts that individually meet one of the above criteria at the end of the reporting period are included in the group of contracts. New contracts may be added to the group in the reporting period when they meet one of the above recognition criteria. The composition of the group cannot be revised once all the contracts have been added to the group.\n\nA group of insurance contracts acquired in a transfer of insurance contracts or in a business combination is recognised at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Insurance acquisition cash flows\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are cash flows arising from the costs of selling, underwriting and starting a group of insurance contracts (issued or expected to be issued), that are directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs, and that include cash flows that are not directly attributable to individual contracts or groups of insurance contracts within the portfolio.\n\nThe Group uses a systematic and rational method to allocate:\n\n- z insurance acquisition cash flows directly attributable to a group of insurance contracts:\n- z to that group;  and\n- z to groups that will include insurance contracts that are expected to arise from renewals of the insurance contracts in that group;\n- z insurance acquisition cash flows directly attributable to a portfolio of insurance contracts but not directly attributable to the groups of contracts in this portfolio, to groups of contracts in the portfolio.\n\nExcept  for  some  groups  of  contracts  measured  applying  the premium allocation approach for which the option to recognise insurance acquisition cash flows directly in expenses was elected, insurance  acquisition  cash  flows  paid  (or  for  which  a  liability has  been  recognised  applying  another  IFRS  standard)  before the  recognition  of  the  related  group  of  insurance  contracts  are recognised as an asset. Such an asset is recognised for each related group of insurance contracts.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group revises the amounts of  insurance  acquisition  cash  flows  allocated  to  the  groups  of contracts not yet recognised in order to reflect any change in the assumptions related to the method of allocation used.\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the  Group  assesses  the recoverability of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows if facts and circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. In this aim, the Group applies:\n\n- z an impairment test at the level of existing and future groups of insurance contracts;\n- z an additional impairment test that focuses specifically on the cash flows allocated to the expected renewals.\n\nIn the case of an impairment loss, the carrying amount of the asset is adjusted and the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. If the conditions that gave rise to the impairment no longer exist or have improved, the reversal of whole or part of the impairment loss previously recognised, is recognised in profit or loss and the carrying amount of the asset is increased consequently.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the assets for insurance acquisition cash flows identified by the Group are fully impaired, and hence their carrying amount in the balance sheet is nil.\n\n## Measurement of insurance contracts\n\nThe contracts in the scope of IFRS 17 can be measured using three models:\n\n- z the general measurement model, or BBA model (Building Block Approach), is the default measurement model;\n- z the VFA model (Variable Fee Approach), is the compulsory model for insurance contracts with direct participation features;\n- z the PAA model (Premium Allocation Approach), is an optional simplified model that can be used when certain criteria are met.\n\nThe Group uses the three models to measure its contracts.\n\nThe  general  measurement  model  is  mainly  applied  to  creditor insurance, long-term care, protection, work stoppage, term life and some health activities of the Group.\n\nThe Group analysed the fulfilment of the conditions that define insurance contracts with direct participation features (see section on the classification of contracts above) in order to determine which of its contracts meet their definition. Thus, the savings, pensions and funeral businesses of the Group are measured using the VFA model.\n\nThe Group has chosen to apply the PAA model to its property and casualty  activities  (insurance  contracts  issued  and  reinsurance contracts held).\n\nThis  asset  for  insurance  acquisition  cash  flows  is  derecognised, wholly or partially, when the insurance acquisition cash flows are included in the measurement of the related group of contracts (see section related to the measurement of contracts below).\n\n1 6",

The cash flows from each scenario are discounted and weighted by the estimated probability of the corresponding outcome in order to derive the expected present value.\n\nEstimates of future cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows at the closing date. These information include internal and external historical data on claims and other characteristics of insurance contracts, updated to reflect the conditions prevailing at the measurement date, in particular the assumptions about the future at that same date.\n\nEstimates of future cash flows reflect the perspective of the Group regarding the current conditions on the closing date, provided that the estimates of any relevant market variables are consistent with observable market prices. The estimates of the market variables are determined based on a maximised use of observable market inputs.\n\nIn  life  insurance,  the  future  cash  flows  projection  incorporates assumptions about the policyholders' behaviour and management decisions. These assumptions cover factors such as surrenders, the participation policy and assets allocation policy.\n\nThe best estimate of the expected present value includes the impact of  financial  options  and  guarantees  if  it  is  material.  Stochastic simulation methods are used for this purpose. Stochastic modelling consists in the projection of future cash flows according to a great number of possible economic scenarios as regards market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.\n\nThe main options measured by the Group are the surrender option in savings or pensions contracts, guaranteed minimum rates and technical rates, contractual participation clauses and the guaranteed minimum benefit in unit-linked contracts.\n\nThe modelled participation clauses comply with local regulatory and contractual constraints and are the subject of strategic assumptions reviewed by the entities' management.\n\nWhen contracts encompass a significant mortality (or longevity) risk, the projections are likewise estimated based on regulatory mortality tables or experience tables when these are deemed more prudent.\n\nWhen a minimum guaranteed death benefit is included in a unitlinked contract, so as to ensure the beneficiary of the contract at least the initial invested capital irrespective of the changes in the value of the units held, this benefit is determined on the basis of an economic method (stochastic scenarios).\n\nIn non-life insurance, the Group estimates the ultimate cost of the claims incurred but not yet paid at the closing date and the value of expected recoveries by reviewing the reported individual claims and by estimating the claims incurred but not yet reported. Their determination is the result of, on the one hand, the application of deterministic statistical methods based on historical data and, on the other hand, the use of actuarial assumptions drawing upon experts' judgement for the purpose of estimating the ultimate cost. The change in the parameters used may lead to a noticeable change in the value of these estimates at the closing date, particularly as concerns long-tail insurance branches for which the inherent uncertainty in terms of the materialisation of the forecasts is in general more important. These parameters are especially tied to the uncertainty that surrounds qualifying and quantifying the damages, the  scales  (table  and  rates)  that  will  be  applied  to  determine compensation, and the probability of the use of annuities in cases involving physical injury. For the Group, this regards the insurance lines  related  to  vehicle  and  general  civil  responsibility,  personal accident cover, and medical professional responsibility.\n\n## Contract boundary\n\nThe measurement of a group of contracts includes all the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group, i.e. all future cash flows that arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services. Such a substantive obligation ends when:\n\n- z the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks; or\n- z the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio of insurance contracts that contains the contract and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risk of that portfolio, and the pricing of the premiums up to the date when the risks are reassessed does not take into account the risks that relate to periods after the reassessment date.\n\nThe contract boundary is reassessed at each closing date in order to take into account the effect of changes in circumstances related to the substantive rights and obligations of the Group, and hence may change overtime.\n\nDetermining  the  contract  boundary  requires  judgement  and considering the substantive rights and obligations of the Group pursuant to the contract. To this end, the Group analysed in detail the characteristics of its contracts, and in particular the possibility to reset their price. Thus, the Group considered, for instance, that free or scheduled future payments of savings and pensions contracts, or  the  liquidation  phase  of  pensions  contracts  with  mandatory annuities, are within the contract boundary; however, the renewals of non-life insurance contracts due to the tacit renewal clause are not within the contract boundary.",

        "page_content": "Cash flows included in the measurement of contracts\n\nCash flows within the boundary of an insurance contract are those that relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including cash flows for which the entity has discretion over the amount or timing. They include notably:\n\n- z premiums from a policyholder and any additional cash flows that result from those premiums;\n- z payments to (or on behalf of) a policyholder;\n- z an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows (see above) attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs;\n- z claim handling costs;\n- z policy administration and maintenance costs;\n- z transaction-based taxes and levies that arise directly from existing insurance contracts, or that can be attributed to them on a reasonable and consistent basis;\n- z costs the Group will incur performing investment activity, to the extent the Group performs that activity to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders;\n- z costs the Group will incur providing investment-return services and investment-related services to policyholders;\n- z an allocation of fixed and variable overheads (such as the costs of accounting, human resources, information technology and support, building depreciation, rent, and maintenance and utilities) that are directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts;\n- z any other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.\n\nCash flows are allocated by function (acquisition activities, other fulfilment activities, and other activities) at the level of each legal entity using activity-based costing techniques.\n\nCash  flows  attributable  to  acquisition  activities  and  to  other fulfilment  activities  are  allocated  to  groups  of  contracts  using methods that are systematic and rational and that are consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics. They comprise both direct costs and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads.\n\nThe Group has not identified insurance contracts without direct participation features that give it discretion over the cash flows it will pay to policyholders.\n\nCash  flows  that  are  not  directly  attributable  to  a  portfolio  of insurance contracts are recognised in other operating income and expenses as they are incurred.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Group adjusts the estimates of future cash flows to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks related to those cash flows, to the extent that these risks are not included in the estimates of cash flows.\n\nDiscount rates are a major parameter to measure insurance contracts applying IFRS 17 requirements; they are notably used to measure the fulfilment cash flows, and, for insurance contracts without direct participation features, to determine the interest to accrete on the CSM, measure the changes to the CSM and determine the amount of the insurance finance income or expenses included in profit or loss when the OCI option is applied (see the section on subsequent measurement below).\n\nIFRS  17  does  not  require  a  particular  estimation  technique  for determining discount rates, but requires this method to take into account the factors that arise from the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts, and to maximise the use of observable inputs. The methodology used by the Group when determining the yield curve is a bottom-up approach, that rests on a risk-free yield curve adjusted by an illiquidity premium reflecting the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity of insurance contracts. The Group determines the curve of risk-free rates from the rates of interest rate swap contracts observable for the considered currency, adjusted for credit risk. This curve is extrapolated between the last liquid point and an ultimate forward rate reflecting expectations about real interest rates and long-term inflation rates. The extrapolation method of the yield curve used by the Group is the smoothing points method: rates beyond the first smoothing point (FSP) are extrapolated via a function taking into account the ultimate forward rate (UFR), the last liquid forward rate (LLFR) and a parameter for the speed of convergence. The illiquidity premiums are determined based  on  a  reference  portfolio  corresponding  to  the  assets held to cover contracts. Illiquidity premiums of bond assets are determined by comparing the spreads of the bond portfolio to the remuneration of credit risk. Illiquidity premiums of other assets are obtained using a method derived from the Sharpe ratio to quantify the outperformance attributable to these classes of assets. The illiquidity premiums thus obtained for the assets of the reference portfolio are transposed to determine the illiquidity premiums of the corresponding insurance liabilities by using an application ratio depending on the comparison between the respective durations of assets and liabilities in order to reflect the growth of illiquidity premiums with the duration.\n\n1 6",

The measurement metric used by the Group is the VaR (Value at Risk) with a quantile of 80% for life activities and 85% for non-life activities, and an ultimate horizon (approximated by the duration of liabilities for life activities). This adjustment reflects the diversification benefits of risks at the entity level, determined using a correlation matrix. A diversification between entities is also taken into account.\n\n## Contractual service margin\n\nThe CSM of a group of insurance contracts represents the unearned profit the Group will recognise as it provides insurance contract services.\n\nOn initial recognition of a group of contracts, if the sum of the fulfilment cash flows measured at the date of initial recognition, any\n\ncash flows arising at that date and of any amount that results from the derecognition at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group (including any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows) is a net cash inflow, then the group of contracts is profitable. In this case, the CSM is measured as an amount equal and opposite to this cash inflow, resulting in no income or expense arising on initial recognition.\n\nFor groups of contracts acquired in a transfer of insurance contracts or in a business combination, the consideration received or paid for the contracts is included in the fulfilment cash flows as a proxy for the premiums received at the date of acquisition. In the case of a business combination, the consideration received or paid is the fair value of the contracts at that date.\n\nIf the sum calculated previously is a net cash outflow, then the group of contracts is onerous. In this case, the net cash inflow is recognised immediately as a loss in profit or loss (or as an adjustment to the goodwill or a gain on a bargain purchase in the case of contracts acquired in a business combination), so that the carrying amount of the liability related to the group is equal to the fulfilment cash flows and the CSM of the group is therefore nil. A loss component of the liability for remaining coverage is then established depicting the losses recognised. This loss component determines the amounts that are presented subsequently in profit or loss as reversals of losses on onerous groups and are consequently excluded from insurance revenue (see section on presentation below).\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of a group of contracts at each closing date is the sum of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC).\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage comprises the fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service allocated to the group at that date and the contractual service margin at that date.\n\nThe liability for incurred claims comprises the fulfilment cash flows for incurred claims and other expenses not yet paid, including claims incurred but not yet reported.",

These  contracts  are  insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts, under which the entity promises an investment return based on underlying items.\n\nThe underlying items are items that determine some of the amounts payable to the policyholders. As concerns the Group, these items comprise mainly portfolios of financial assets, as well as, for French euro-denominated savings contracts, the technical result of these contracts.\n\nThe Group's policy is to hold the underlying financial assets.\n\nThe composition and the fair value of the latter are detailed in the note 7.3.\n\nInsurance contracts with direct participation features are contracts under which the Group's obligation to the policyholder is the net of:\n\n- z the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items; and\n- z the variable fee in exchange for the future services provided by the insurance contract, that is equal to the difference between the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items and the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.\n\nThe changes in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items do not relate to future service and therefore do not adjust the contractual service margin: they are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of  the  underlying  items  relate  to  future  service  and  adjust  the contractual service margin.\n\nThe carrying amount of the CSM of a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features at the closing date is the carrying amount at the opening date, adjusted for:\n\n- z the effect of any new contracts added to the group during the period;\n- z the change in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items and the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, except to the extent that:\n- z the risk mitigation option is applied (see below) in order not to recognise a change in the CSM to reflect the changes in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks on the amount of its share of the underlying items or the fulfilment cash flows;\n\n1 6",

The Group has chosen not to apply this option.\n\n## Loss component\n\nFor  contracts  measured  using  the  general  model  and  the  VFA model, the Group establishes a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage for onerous groups of contracts (see above). This loss component determines the amounts that are presented subsequently in profit or loss as reversals of losses on onerous groups of contracts and are consequently excluded from insurance revenue (see section on presentation below).\n\nWhen fulfilment cash flows are incurred, they are allocated based on  a  systematic  method  between  the  loss  component  and  the liability for remaining coverage excluding the loss component. The systematic method applied by the Group is determined on the basis of the proportion of the loss component in the total estimate of the present value of future cash outflows and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk on the beginning of each period (or on initial recognition if a group of contracts is initially recognised in the period), excluding investment components.\n\nAny subsequent decrease in the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service, and any subsequent increase in the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items for contracts with direct participation features, are allocated solely to the loss component.\n\nIf the loss component is reduced to zero, then any excess over the amount allocated to the loss component establishes a new CSM for the group of contracts concerned.\n\n## Measurement of contracts measured using the PAA model\n\nThe  premium  allocation  approach  (PAA  model)  is  an  optional measurement model that enables a simplified measurement of the liability for remaining coverage of a group of insurance contracts if either of the following two eligibility criteria is met at the inception date of the group:\n\n- z the Group reasonably expects that such simplification would produce a measurement of the liability for remaining coverage for the group that would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the requirements of the general model; or\n- z the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less.\n\nThe Group has chosen to apply this approach to its property and casualty  activities  (insurance  contracts  issued  and  reinsurance contracts  held).  The  vast  majority  of  the  groups  of  contracts concerned meet the second eligibility criterion, namely a coverage period of each of the contracts in the group being one year or less.\n\nOn initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage is the premiums received at the date of initial recognition minus the amount at that date of any insurance acquisition cash flows allocated to this group and plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts (including any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows).\n\nFor a group of contracts measured using the PAA model, the Group may choose as an accounting policy choice to expense insurance acquisition cash flows, if any, when these expenses are incurred, provided that the coverage period of each contract in the group at initial recognition is no more than one year. The Group has chosen not to apply this option for the measurement of groups of contracts measured using the PAA model (except for the contracts of its Japanese subsidiary), and therefore includes insurance acquisition cash flows in the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage.\n\nOn subsequent measurement, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage is increased by the premiums received during the period and any amount recognised as expenses due to the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows, and decreased by the amount recognised as insurance revenue for services provided in the period and insurance acquisition cash flows paid during the period.\n\nOn initial recognition of each group of contracts, the Group expects that the time between the provision of the services and the related premium due date is no more than one year. Consequently, the Group has chosen not to adjust the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage to reflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk.\n\nIf at any time during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts measured using the PAA model is onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss and increases the liability for remaining coverage, to the extent that the present estimates of the fulfilment cash flows related to the remaining coverage of the group exceed the carrying amount of the liability for this coverage.

        "page_content": "of contracts are discounted (at current rates) to the extent that the liability for incurred claims is also discounted.\n\nFor contracts measured using the PAA model, the loss component established in the case of an onerous group of contracts is allocated to the liability for remaining coverage; the reversals of this loss component cannot lead to a liability for remaining coverage that is less than the one that would be determined in the absence of a loss component.\n\nThe Group measures the liability for incurred claims of a group of insurance contracts measured using the PAA model as the amount of the fulfilment cash flows relating to incurred claims, in accordance with the requirements applicable for the general model. However, it is not required to adjust the future cash flows to reflect the time value of money and the effect of financial risk if those cash flows are expected to be paid or received in one year or less from the date the claims are incurred. With the exception of the measurement of the contracts of its Japanese subsidiary, the Group does not apply this option, the future cash flows are therefore discounted (at current rates).\n\n## Recognition of investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nInvestment contracts with discretionary participation features do not include a transfer of significant insurance risk. Consequently, the following requirements in IFRS 17 are modified for the recognition of those contracts:\n\n- z the date of initial recognition is the date the entity becomes party to the contract;\n- z the cash flows within the contract boundary are those that result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at a present or future date. The Group has no substantive obligation to deliver cash if it has the practical ability to set a price for the promise to deliver the cash that fully reflects the amount of cash promised and related risks;\n- z the allocation of the CSM is made so that the CSM is recognised over the duration of the group of contracts, in a systematic way that reflects the transfer of investment services under the contract.\n\n## Recognition of investment contracts without discretionary participation features\n\nThese investment contracts correspond to financial liabilities and are within the scope of IFRS 9.  These are mainly unit-linked contracts without minimum guaranteed rates and without a transfer option into a fund with discretionary participation features.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the liabilities related to these contracts are recognised as deposits. Hence, the premiums received and the claims paid, net of the insurer's fees, are recognised directly in the balance sheet. Only revenues and expenses related to the acquisition and servicing of the contracts are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Recognition of reinsurance contracts\n\nNo reinsurance contract within the Group comprises characteristics (such  as  the  absence  of  risk  transfer)  that  would  result  in  its qualification as an investment contract within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  IFRS  17,  reinsurance  contracts  issued  and reinsurance contracts held cannot be insurance contracts with direct participation features, and therefore cannot be measured using the VFA model.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts issued (accepted reinsurance)\n\nReinsurance contracts issued are recognised in accordance with the requirements applicable to insurance contracts without direct participation features set out above.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts held (ceded reinsurance)\n\nThe requirements applicable to insurance contracts without direct participation features set out above are subject to the following modifications  with  respect  to  their  application  to  reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## Level of aggregation\n\nPortfolios of reinsurance contracts held are set in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17 applicable to insurance contracts issued, however, given the fact that reinsurance contracts held cannot be onerous, the Group considers, for the purpose of applying such requirements to reinsurance contracts held, that any reference to onerous contracts applies to reinsurance contracts held on which there is a net gain on initial recognition.\n\nThe application of those requirements within the Group leads to groups of reinsurance contracts held that comprise a single contract.\n\n## Recognition date\n\nA group of reinsurance contracts held is recognised at the beginning of the coverage period of the group. As an exception to this principle, for a group of reinsurance contracts held that provide proportionate coverage, the Group delays the recognition date until the date of initial recognition of any underlying insurance contract, if that date is later than the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\nHowever, if the Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts at an earlier date and entered into the related reinsurance contract at or before that earlier date, the group of reinsurance contracts held is recognised at this earlier date.\n\n## Contract boundary\n\nApplying the requirements related to the boundary of insurance contracts  issued  set  out  above  to  reinsurance  contracts  held entails that the cash flows are within the boundary of a group of reinsurance contracts held if they arise from the substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the cedant is compelled to pay amounts to the reinsurer or in which the cedant has a substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer. The substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer ends when the latter has the practical ability to reassess the transferred risks and set a price level consequently, or has the substantive right to end the reinsurance contract.\n\nCash flows within the boundary of reinsurance contracts held are therefore determined as cash flows stemming from the underlying contracts issued or that the Group expects to issue or cede under the reinsurance contract until the first possible termination date of the reinsurance contract.\n\n## Measurement - Reinsurance contracts held measured using the general model\n\nTo measure a group of reinsurance contracts held, the Group applies the same accounting methods as for insurance contracts without direct participation features set out above, with the modifications presented below.\n\n1 6",

The changes in the fulfilment cash flows that result from changes in the risk of non-performance are recognised in profit or loss in the income and expenses related to reinsurance contracts held, as the Group considers this risk as a non-financial risk.\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents the amount of risk being transferred by the cedant to the reinsurer.\n\nOn initial recognition, the CSM of a group of reinsurance contracts held represents a net cost or a net gain on purchasing the group of reinsurance contracts held. Therefore, the CSM is measured as the amount equal and opposite to the sum of the fulfilment cash flows, the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group, any cash flows arising at that date and any income recognised in profit or loss due to the recognition of losses on onerous underlying contracts.\n\nHowever,  if  the  net  cost  of  purchasing  reinsurance  coverage relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the group of reinsurance contracts held, the Group recognises such a cost immediately in profit or loss as an expense.\n\nThe carrying amount of the CSM of a group of reinsurance contracts held at the closing date is the carrying amount at the opening date adjusted for the following:\n\n- z the effect of any new contracts added to the group during the period;\n- z interest accreted on the CSM during the period, measured at the discount rates determined on initial recognition;\n- z income recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period related to the loss-recovery component (see below);\n- z reversals of a loss-recovery component recognised to the extent those reversals are not changes in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of reinsurance contracts held (see below);\n- z changes in the fulfilment cash flows, measured at the discount rates determined on initial recognition, to the extent that these changes relate to future service, unless they result from a change in the fulfilment cash flows of an onerous group of underlying contracts;\n- z the effect of any currency exchange differences arising on the CSM; and\n- z the amount recognised in profit or loss because of services received from the reinsurer in the period, determined after all the other adjustments above.\n\n## Reinsurance of onerous underlying insurance contracts\n\nIf the Group enters into a reinsurance contract held no later than the date of initial recognition of onerous underlying contracts, it adjusts the CSM of the group to which the reinsurance contract held belongs, and recognises income consequently, when a loss is recognised on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts or when onerous underlying insurance contracts are  added  to  an  existing  group.  This  adjustment  establishes  a loss-recovery component of the asset for remaining coverage of the group of reinsurance contracts held, depicting the recovery of\n\nlosses of onerous underlying insurance contracts. The adjustment is determined by multiplying:\n\n- z the loss recognised on the underlying onerous insurance contracts; and\n- z the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\nAfter establishing a loss-recovery component, the Group adjusts this component to reflect changes in the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts.\n\nIf the reinsurance contract held covers only part of the underlying insurance  contracts  included  in  an  onerous  group  of  contracts, the Group uses a systematic and rational method of allocation to determine the portion of losses recognised on the onerous group of  insurance  contracts  that  relates  to  the  underlying  insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe  loss-recovery  component  determines  the  amounts  that  are subsequently presented in profit or loss as reversals of recoveries of losses from reinsurance contracts held and that are consequently excluded from the allocation of the premiums paid to the reinsurer (see section on presentation below). The loss recovery-component is adjusted to reflect the changes in the loss component of the onerous group  of  underlying  insurance  contracts,  however,  its  carrying amount must not exceed the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## Measurement - Reinsurance contracts held measured using the PAA model\n\nThe PAA model allows to simplify the measurement of a group of reinsurance contracts held if either of the two following eligibility criteria are met at the inception of the group:\n\n- z the Group reasonably expects that the measurement resulting from this method would not differ materially from the one that would result from applying the requirements of the general model; or\n- z the coverage period of each contract in the group of contracts is one year or less.\n\nAs regards property and casualty insurance, the Group uses the PAA model to simplify the measurement of groups of reinsurance contracts held when the above criteria are met. The Group applies the same principles for the measurement of a group of reinsurance contracts held using the PAA model as those for the measurement of groups of insurance contracts issued that are set out above, adapted to reflect the features of reinsurance contracts held that differ from those of insurance contracts issued, for example the generation of expenses or reduction in expenses rather than revenue.\n\nIf a loss-recovery component is established for a group of reinsurance contracts held measured using the PAA model, the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the asset for remaining coverage instead of adjusting the CSM.\n\n## Derecognition and modification of contracts\n\nThe Group derecognises an insurance contract:\n\n- z when it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or cancelled;\n- z when it is transferred to a third party;",

If a contract modification does not result in its derecognition, then the Group treats the changes in cash flows caused by the modification as changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows.\n\n## Effect of accounting estimates made in interim financial statements\n\nThe Group prepares interim financial statements applying IAS 34. It made the accounting policy choice that consists in changing the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements when applying IFRS 17 in its subsequent interim financial statements and its annual financial statements.\n\n## Presentation\n\n## Presentation in the balance sheet\n\nThe Group presents separately in the balance sheet the carrying amount of:\n\n- z portfolios of insurance contracts issued that are assets;\n- z portfolios of insurance contracts issued that are liabilities;\n- z portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets;\n- z portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  recognised  for  cash  flows  incurred  before the recognition of the related group of contracts (including assets for insurance acquisition cash flows) are included in the carrying amount of the related portfolios of contracts.\n\n## Presentation in the income statement and in other comprehensive income\n\nThe Group recognises income and expenses related to the contracts within the scope of IFRS  17 in the following items of the income statement:\n\n- z insurance service result, that comprises the following items:\n- z insurance revenue;\n- z insurance service expenses;\n- z income or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held;\n- z insurance finance income or expenses;\n- z insurance finance income or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held.\n\nIncome  or  expenses  related  to  reinsurance  contracts  held  are presented separately from income or expenses related to insurance contracts issued.\n\nThe Group has chosen to present income or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held, other than insurance finance income or expenses, as a single amount within the insurance service result.\n\nThe Group has chosen to disaggregate the changes in the risk adjustment  for  non-financial  risk  between  the  insurance  service result  and  insurance  finance  income  or  expenses  for  insurance contracts without direct participation features, and to include the\n\nentire changes in the insurance service result for insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\nInsurance revenue  and  insurance  service  expenses  exclude investment components.\n\nAmounts recognised in the comprehensive income\n\n## Insurance revenue - Contracts measured using the general model and the VFA model\n\nInsurance revenue recognised in the period depicts the provision of services arising from a group of insurance contract at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.\n\nThe Group recognises insurance revenue and reduces the liability for remaining coverage as it performs its obligation for services, i.e. as it provides insurance contract services (insurance coverage and investment services) for the group of contracts.\n\nThe  total  insurance  revenue  over  the  coverage  period  is  the consideration for the contracts, i.e. the amount of premiums paid adjusted  for  a  financing  effect  and  excluding  any  investment components.\n\nInsurance revenue recognised during the period comprises:\n\n- z the amounts related to the changes in the liability for remaining coverage that relate to services for which the Group expects to receive consideration:\n- z insurance service expenses incurred in the period (measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the reporting period), excluding amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage, repayments of investment components, amounts that relate to transaction-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties, insurance acquisition expenses and the amount related to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- z changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding changes included in insurance finance income or expenses, changes that relate to future service, and amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage;\n- z the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss because of the provision of insurance contract services in the period;\n- z other amounts, if any, for example, experience adjustments for premium receipts other than those that relate to future service;\n- z the portion of the premiums that relate to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows.\n\nThe Group allocates the portion of the premiums that relate to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows to each period in a systematic way on the basis of the passage of time. The Group has applied a linear allocation method and has not taken into account interest accretion.\n\nThe same amount is recognised as insurance service expenses.\n\n## Recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss\n\nThe amount of the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts, which is recognised in each period in insurance revenue in order to reflect insurance contract services provided for this group\n\n1 6",

Coverage units are reviewed and updated at each closing date.\n\nInsurance contract services encompass a coverage for an insured event (insurance coverage) as well as, in the case of insurance contracts  with  direct  participation  features,  the  management  of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder (investment-related services) and, in the case of insurance contracts without direct participation features, the generation of an investment return for the policyholder (investment-return services), if applicable.\n\nThe period over which the investment-related or investment-return services are provided ends at or before the date when all amounts due to current policyholders relating to those services have been paid.\n\nThe contracts of the Group measured using the general model do not encompass investment-return services.\n\nThe standard is not prescriptive as regards the indicator to use to reflect the quantity of services provided during the period, and it is therefore necessary to resort to judgement on this point. The methodology  used  by  the  Group  to  define  coverage  units  and consequently the expected pattern of release of the CSM in profit or loss is adapted to the characteristics of the contracts concerned. For insurance contracts with direct participation features, measured according to the variable fee approach, the methodology used to allocate the CSM in profit or loss aims at economically reflecting the asset management service provided by the insurer during each period: thereby, beyond the risk neutral returns on assets projected in actuarial models used to measure this type of contracts, it also takes into account the over-return corresponding to the real performance of these assets. For other contracts, measured according to the general model, the coverage units are defined based on various indicators adapted depending on the type of guarantee (such as the death benefit or the outstanding capital).\n\nAn analysis of the expected recognition in profit or loss of the CSM remaining at the end of the reporting period is provided in the note 6.19.4 below.\n\n## Insurance revenue - Contracts measured using the PAA model\n\nFor groups of contracts measured using the PAA model, the amount of  insurance  revenue  of  the  period  is  the  amount  of  expected premium receipts allocated to the period (excluding investment components).\n\nThe Group allocates the amount of these expected premium receipts over the periods where insurance contract services are provided on the basis of the passage of time for all contracts measured using the PAA model.\n\n## Insurance service expenses\n\nInsurance  service  expenses  that  arise  from  insurance  contracts issued are generally recognised in profit or loss when incurred. They\n\nexclude the repayments of investment components and include the following items:\n\n- z incurred claims (excluding investment components) and other incurred insurance service expenses;\n- z amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows;\n- z losses on onerous groups of contracts and reversals of such losses;\n- z changes in the liability for incurred claims that do not arise from the time value of money, financial risk, and changes therein;\n- z impairment losses on assets for insurance acquisition cash flows and reversals of these impairment losses.\n\nFor contracts not measured using the PAA model, the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows is reflected in the insurance service expenses at the same amount as the portion of the premiums that relate to recovering those acquisition cash flows that is recognised in insurance revenue.\n\nFor  contracts  that  are  measured  using  the  PAA  model,  the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows is recognised on the basis of the passage of time.\n\nThe other expenses, not listed in the items above, are included in the other operating expenses in the income statement.\n\n## Income or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held\n\nIncome or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held comprise:\n\n- z the allocation of the premiums paid (reinsurance expenses), that includes the following amounts related to the changes in the asset for remaining coverage that relate to services for which the Group expects to pay a consideration:\n- z amounts recovered for claims and other expenses incurred in the period (measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the reporting period), excluding repayments of investment components and the amount related to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- z changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, excluding the changes included in insurance finance income or expenses related to reinsurance contracts held and changes that relate to future service;\n- z the amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss because of services received during the period;\n- z other amounts, if any, for example, experience adjustments for ceded premiums other than those that relate to future service;\n- z the net cost of retroactive reinsurance;\n- z the amounts recovered from the reinsurer:\n- z amounts recovered for claims and other expenses incurred in the period (excluding investment components);\n- z changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to the asset for incurred claims that do not arise from the time value of money, financial risk, and changes therein;\n- z changes in the loss-recovery component relating to onerous underlying contracts:\n- -income recognised in profit or loss on initial recognition of onerous underlying contracts;",

The Group allocates the allocation of the premiums paid on the basis of the passage of time over the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\nCeding  commissions  that  are  not  contingent  on  claims  covered by the underlying contracts reduce the premiums to be paid to the reinsurer and are therefore recognised in the allocation of the premiums paid. Ceding commissions that are contingent on claims covered by the underlying contracts reduce the amounts recovered from the reinsurer.\n\n## Insurance finance income or expenses\n\nInsurance  finance  income  or  expenses  comprise  the  changes  in the carrying amount of the groups of insurance and reinsurance contracts arising from the effect of time value of money, financial risk and changes therein.\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts measured using the VFA model, these  changes  exclude  changes  that  are  allocated  to  the  loss component (that are included in insurance service expenses), and include changes in the measurement of groups of contracts caused by changes in the value of underlying items (excluding additions and withdrawals).\n\nInsurance  finance  income  or  expenses  of  the  period  may  be presented either entirely in profit or loss or disaggregated between profit or loss and other comprehensive income ('OCI option').\n\nFor insurance contracts other than insurance contracts with direct participation  features  for  which  the  entity  holds  the  underlying items, the amount presented in profit or loss is determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts:\n\n- z for groups of contracts measured using the general model for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk do not have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder: using the discount rates determined at the date of initial recognition of the group of contracts;\n- z for groups of contracts measured using the PAA model: using the discount rates determined at the date of the incurred claim.\n\nFor insurance contracts with direct participation features for which the Group holds the underlying items, the amount recognised in profit\n\nor loss is the amount that eliminates accounting mismatches with income or expenses recognised in profit or loss for the underlying items held. Applying this option, the Group recognises therefore in profit or loss expenses or income that exactly match the income or expenses included in profit or loss for the underlying items, resulting in the net of the separately presented items being nil.\n\nThe Group has made the accounting policy choice, for most of its portfolios of insurance contracts, to resort to the option ('OCI option') allowing for a disaggregation of insurance finance income or  expenses  for  the  period  between  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive income. The application of this option leads thereby, for insurance contracts with direct participation features for which the entity holds the underlying items, to present in profit or loss an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches with income or expenses included in profit or loss on the underlying items held; and, for the other contracts, to present in other comprehensive income the effect of changes in the discount rates on the measurement of the contracts.\n\nThe groups of insurance contracts, including the contractual service margin, that generate cash flows in a foreign currency, are treated as monetary items.\n\n## Investment components\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  standard  need  identifying  the  investment components, which are defined as the amounts that an insurance contract  requires  the  Group  to  repay  to  a  policyholder  in  all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs; they shall not be recognised in insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.\n\nThe main investment components identified by the Group concern savings and pensions contracts that have an explicit surrender or transfer value. For non-life insurance, insurance contracts issued by the Group generally do not include any investment component.\n\n## PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN INSURANCE ACTIVITIES) (IAS 37)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances identifies obligations (legal or constructive) resulting from a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, whose timing and amount are uncertain but can be reliably estimated. Such estimates are discounted where the effect of doing so is material.\n\nFor obligations other than those related to credit risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has set aside provisions to cover:\n\n- z operational risks;\n- z employee benefits (see following section);\n- z legal claims and risks;\n- z tax risks (excluding income tax).\n\nThe measurement of the following provisions may be subject to estimation:\n\n- z provision for operational risks, for which the inventory of identified risks, and an assessment by the management of the frequency of the incident and the potential financial impact are taken into account;\n- z provisions for legal risks, that rely on judgment and corresponds to the management's best estimate, given information available at the end of the reporting period.\n\n1 6",

This method consists in attributing a unit of benefit entitlement to each period of service of the employee. This unit is calculated on the basis of the discounted present value of the future benefit.\n\nCalculations of retirement benefits and future employee benefits are based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, the employee turnover rate, the rate of salary and social security costs increase, drawn up by the management (see note 9.3).\n\nDiscount rates are determined based on the average duration of the obligation, that is to say the unweight average of durations calculated between the date of valuation and the date of payment weighted for employee turn-over assumptions. The underlying used is the discount rate in reference to the iBoxx AA index.\n\nIn accordance with IAS  19, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises all actuarial gains or losses in other comprehensive income (items that  cannot  be  reclassified).  Actuarial  gains  and  losses  consist of  adjustments  relating  to  experience  (difference  between  the estimated and actual result) and the effect of changes made to actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is determined on the basis of the discount rates used to measure the defined benefit obligation. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified).\n\nThe amount of the defined benefit liability is equal to the present value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  at  the  reporting  date, calculated  according  to  the  actuarial  method  recommended  by IAS  19; less, where appropriate, the fair value of the plan assets held  to  cover  this  obligation.  Such  assets  may  be  represented by a qualifying insurance policy issued by an insurer that is not a related party. Where the obligation is entirely covered by a policy corresponding exactly, in its amount and period, to all or part of the benefits to be paid under the plan, the fair value of this policy is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (that is, the\n\namount of the corresponding actuarial liability). In the particular case where obligations are covered by an insurance policy issued by a consolidated entity, they are not offset in liabilities by the associated assets, which are recognised separately as assets.\n\nFor  non-covered  obligations,  a  provision  aimed  at  covering termination benefits is recognised as a liability under the heading 'Provisions'. This provision equals the amount of the obligations relating to employees of entities within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group, in service at the end of the reporting period and covered by the Collective Employment Agreement of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group that came into force on 1 January 2005.\n\nA provision aimed at covering the cost of early departures is also included under the heading 'Provisions'. This provision covers the present value of the additional cost resulting from the various early departure  agreements  signed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  entities which allow employees reaching the required age to be exempt from their service.\n\nLastly, supplementary  retirement  obligations,  which  generate obligations for the companies concerned, are subject to provisions determined from the actuarial debt representing these obligations. These provisions are also recognised as liabilities on the balance sheet under the heading 'Provisions' (see note 9.3).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThere are various mandatory retirement plans to which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations  and  the  contributing  companies  have  no  legal  or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions if the plans do not have sufficient assets to provide all the benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the current and prior reporting  years.  As  a  result,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  has  no liabilities in this respect other than the contributions to be paid for the past reporting period (see note 9.2).\n\n## Other long-term employee benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits are employee benefits, other than post-employment benefits and termination benefits, but not fully due to employees within twelve months after the end of the reporting period in which the related services were rendered.\n\nThis particularly concerns bonuses and other deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of the reporting period in which they were acquired, but which are not indexed on equity instruments.\n\nThe measurement method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits falling under the defined benefit plans category.\n\n## SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (IFRS 2)\n\nThe  IFRS  2  standard Share-based  payments requires  valuation of  share-based  payment  transactions  in  the  company's  income statement and balance sheet. This standard applies to transactions with employees and more specifically to:\n\n- z share-based payment transactions settled in equity instruments;\n- z share-based payment transactions settled in cash.\n\nShare-based payment plans initiated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group that are eligible for IFRS  2 are mainly transactions settled in equity instruments (stock options, free share allocation plans, variable compensation settled in indexed cash or in shares, etc.).",

        "page_content": "Options granted are measured at their fair value at the date of grant primarily using the Black & Scholes model. These are recognised as  expenses  under  the  heading  'Employee  expenses'  with  a corresponding adjustment to equity, spread over the vesting period.\n\nThe shares subscription plans proposed to employees as part of the Employee savings plans are also subject to IFRS  2  standard. The shares are proposed with a maximum discount of 30%. These plans do not have a vesting period but are subject to a lock-up period of 5  years. The employees' benefit is measured as the difference between the fair value of the acquired share at the date of grant and the purchase price paid by the employee on the subscription date multiplied by the number of the shares subscribed. From 1 January 2023,  this  benefit  does  not  take  the  discount  for  post-vesting transfer restrictions into account any more.\n\nThe  cost  of  share-based  payment  plans  settled  in  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. equity instruments and the cost of share subscriptions are recognised in the financial statements of the entities that employ the plan beneficiaries. The impact is recorded under 'Employee expenses', with a corresponding increase in consolidated reserves.\n\n## INCOME TAXES (IAS 12)\n\n## Current taxes\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, income tax includes all taxes based on income, whether current or deferred.\n\nIAS 12 defines the current tax liability as 'the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.' Taxable income is the profit (loss) for a given year measured in accordance with the rules determined by the tax authorities and on the basis of which the income tax shall be paid (recovered).\n\nThe applicable rates and rules used to measure the current tax liability are those in effect in each country where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group companies are based.\n\nThe  current  tax  liability  includes  all  income  taxes,  payable  or recoverable, whose payment is not subject to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several periods.\n\nThe current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount already paid in respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for these periods, the excess shall be recognised as an asset.\n\nTax credits on income from receivables and securities portfolios, when effectively used in the settlement of income tax due for the reporting period, are recognised under the same heading as the income to which they relate. The corresponding tax expense is maintained under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  transactions  conducted  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances may have tax consequences not taken into account in the determination of the current tax liability. Differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base are defined by IAS 12 as temporary differences.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe standard requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the following cases:\n\n- z a deferred tax liability shall be recognised for all taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from:\n\n- z the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- z the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss) at the transaction date;\n- z a deferred tax asset shall be recognised for all deductible temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be allocated;\n- z a deferred tax asset shall also be recognised for the carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be allocated.\n\nDeferred tax calculation takes into account the tax rates applicable in each country and excludes discounting.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other if, and only if:\n\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and\n- z the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, either on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to settle their tax assets and liabilities at the same time during each future period in which it is expected that substantial deferred tax liabilities or assets will be paid or recovered.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in net income for the financial year, unless the tax arises from:\n\n- z either a transaction or event which is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the same or a different period, in which case it is directly credited or debited in other comprehensive income;\n- z or a business combination.\n\n## Capital gains\n\nWhen taxable, unrealised capital gains on securities do not generate taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of the asset and the tax base. As a result, deferred tax is not recognised on these gains. When the relevant securities are classified in the category of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, unrealised gains or losses are recognised in equity. Thus by symmetry, the actual tax expense or tax reduction incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in relation to these unrealised gains or losses is reclassified as a deduction from these gains.\n\nIn France, long-term capital gains on the sale of equity investments, as defined by the General Tax Code, are exempt from corporate income tax (with the exception of a share of expenses that are taxed at the normally applicable rate). Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the year generate a temporary difference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share of expenses.\n\n## Leases IFRS 16\n\nUnder IFRS 16 Leases, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right of use and a deferred tax asset on the rental debt for leases for which the Group is a lessee.\n\n1 6",

These risks are also taken into account in evaluating current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nInterpretation IFRIC  23 concerning the valuation of uncertain tax positions applies if an entity has identified one or more uncertainties about the positions taken concerning its taxes. It also provides clarification on making estimates:\n\n- z analysis must be based on 100% detection by the tax authorities;\n- z the tax risk must be recognised in liabilities if it is more likely than unlikely that the tax authorities will question the treatment applied, for an amount reflecting management's best estimate;\n- z if the probability of repayment by the tax authorities is more than 50%, a receivable should be recognised.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (IAS 21)\n\nOn the reporting date, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are  translated  into  euro,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Assurances Group's functional currency.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, a distinction is made between monetary ( e.g. : debt  instruments)  and  non-monetary  items  (e.g.:  equity instruments).\n\nForeign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the income statement. There are three exceptions to this rule:\n\n- z for debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the component of the foreign exchange difference relating to the amortised cost is recognised through profit or loss; the rest is recognised in other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified);\n- z on items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge or that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income (items that can be reclassified);\n- z for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, the exchange differences linked to credit risk fair value variations are recognised in other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified).\n\nThe  treatment  of  non-monetary  items  varies  according  to  the accounting treatment of these items before conversion:\n\n- z items at historical cost are measured using the exchange rate at the transaction date;\n- z items at fair value are measured using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nExchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised:\n\n- z in profit or loss when the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss;\n- z in other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified) if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income (items that cannot be reclassified).\n\n## LEASES (IFRS 16)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group is only the lessee of leases; it is not the lessor of such contracts.\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet on the date on which the leased asset is made available. The lessee records an asset representing the right of use of the leased asset under 'Operating property and other property, plant & equipment' over the estimated term of the contract and a liability representing the rental payment obligation under 'Other debts' over the same term.\n\nThe lease period of a contract corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the lease adjusted for the contract extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and the termination option that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise.\n\nIn France,  the  Group  principle  applicable  to  long  term  or automatically renewable contracts is to apply the first exit option after 5 years. The term used for the '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial non-cancellable period of three years. When the lessee deems that it is reasonably certain that it will not exercise the exit option after three years, the Group principle will be applied to French commercial leases in most cases, on the lease commencement date. This means that the term will be estimated at six years. The Group principle (first exit option after five years) may not be applied in some specific cases, such as a lease where intermediate exit options have been waived (for example, in return for a rent reduction). In such cases, the initial lease term of nine years will apply (generally unless an automatic extension of up to three years is expected).\n\nThe lease liability is recognised for an amount equal to the present value of the rental payments over the term of the contract. Rental payments include fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or index, and payments that the lessee expects to pay as residual value guarantees, purchase options or early termination penalties. Variable rents that are not based on an index or rate and the nondeductible VAT on rents are excluded when calculating the debt and are recognised under general expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable to the calculation of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is, by default, the lessee's marginal rate of indebtedness over the term of the contract on the date of signature of the contract, when the implicit rate cannot easily be established. The marginal rate of indebtedness takes account of the rent payment structure. It reflects the terms of the lease (duration, guarantee, economic environment, etc.).\n\nThe rental expense is broken down into interest and principal.\n\nThe right of use of the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability plus the initial direct costs, advance payments, restoration costs and less lease inducements. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event of amendment to the lease, re-estimation of the lease period or rent review related to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised for temporary differences in right-ofuse assets and rental liabilities by the lessee.\n\nIn accordance with the exception set out in the standard, short-term leases (initial term of less than twelve months) and leases for which the new value of the leased asset is low are not recognised on the balance sheet. The corresponding leasing expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement under general expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangible assets.",

For the purpose of assessing this principle of power, only substantive (voting or contractual) rights shall be considered. Rights are substantive if their holder is able in practice to exercise them  when  making  decisions  concerning  the  entity's  relevant activities.\n\nControl over a subsidiary governed by voting rights is determined when the voting rights held give Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances the current ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances generally controls the subsidiary if it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the existing or potential voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such ownership does not allow it to direct the relevant activities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also has control over an entity if it holds half or less than half of the voting rights, including potential voting rights, of an entity, but in practice has the capacity to direct the relevant activities on its own, in particular due to the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of the investor's holding of voting rights relative to the dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, or other facts and circumstances.\n\nControl  over  a  structured  entity  is  not  determined  by  the percentage  of  voting  rights  that  by  nature  have  no  impact  on the  returns  generated  by  the  entity.  Analysis  of  control  takes contractual arrangements into account, and also the involvement and decisions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in the creation of the entity, arrangements entered into at inception and risks incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances, rights resulting from agreements that give the investor the power to direct the relevant activities solely under specific circumstances, as well as other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor has the ability of directing the entity's relevant activities. If there is an investment mandate in force, the scope of the decision-making authority relating to the delegation of power over the entity to the manager, as well as the remuneration to which it is entitled in accordance with the contractual agreements, are analysed in order to determine whether the manager is acting as an agent (delegated power) or principal (for its own account).\n\nThus, when decisions relating to the entity's relevant activities are to be taken, the factors to consider in determining whether an entity is acting as agent or principal, are the following: the scope of the decision-making authority relating to the delegation of power over the entity to the manager, the remuneration to which it is entitled\n\nin  accordance  with  the  contractual  agreements,  and  also  the substantive rights held by the other parties involved in the entity that may affect the ability of the decision-maker, and the exposure to variability of returns from other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is exercised if there is a contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity. Decisions affecting the entity's relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn traditional entities, significant influence results from the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity  without  controlling  the  latter.  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances is presumed to have significant influence if it holds, directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting rights of an entity.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods are defined respectively by IFRS  10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28. They reflect the nature of control exercised by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances over the entities that can be consolidated, whatever their activity and whether or not they are incorporated:\n\n- z full consolidation for entities under control, including entities with different accounting structures, even if their activity is not an extension of that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances;\n- z the equity method, for entities under significant influence and joint ventures (excluding joint activities).\n\nFull consolidation consists in substituting the assets and liabilities of each subsidiary for the value of shares held. Non-controlling interests in equity and income are recognised separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are as defined by IFRS  10 and include instruments that are present ownership interests and which entitle to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation together with other equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the group.\n\nInvestments  in  associates  or  joint  ventures  are  recognised  as  a separate item in balance sheet under the heading 'Investments in joint ventures and associates'. The equity method consists in substituting the Group's share in equity and income of concerned entities for the value of shares held.\n\nChanges in the carrying amount of these securities take changes in goodwill into account.\n\nIn the event of additional acquisitions or partial disposals, with the maintenance of joint control or significant influence, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances recognises:\n\n- z in the case of an increase in ownership interest held, additional goodwill;\n- z in the case of a decrease in ownership interest held, a gain or loss on disposal/dilution through profit or loss.\n\nFurthermore,  for  the  recognition  of  its  participation  in  certain entities on which it has a significant influence or a joint control, the Group applies the exemption of the equity method as permitted by IAS 28 \u00a718. This measurement exemption allows the Group to elect to measure at fair value through profit or loss an investment in an associate or a joint venture, that is held by, or indirectly held through, an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund,  unit  trust  and  similar  entities  including  investment-linked\n\n1 6",

For  the  purposes  of  this  election,  investmentlinked insurance funds held as underlying items for a group of insurance contracts with direct participation features (or investment contracts with discretionary participation features) are examples of investment-linked insurance funds. This election shall be made separately for each associate or joint venture, at initial recognition of the participation in the associate or joint venture.\n\n## RESTATEMENTS AND ELIMINATION OF INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  10,  where  necessary,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances restates financial statements to harmonise the valuation methods applied to consolidated companies.\n\nThe  impact  of  Group  internal  transactions  on  the  consolidated balance  sheet  and  income  statement  is  eliminated  for  fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital  gains  or  losses  arising  from  intra-group  asset  transfers are eliminated; any potential impairment measured at the time of disposal in an internal transaction is recognised.\n\n## TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IAS 21)\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  entities  representing  a  'foreign operation'  (subsidiary,  branch,  associate  or  joint  venture)  are converted into euros in two steps:\n\n- z if applicable, the local currency in which the financial statements are prepared is converted into the functional currency (currency of the main business environment of the entity). The conversion is made as if the information had been recognised initially in the functional currency (same conversion principles as for foreign currency transactions here above);\n- z the functional currency is converted into euros, the currency in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are converted at the closing exchange rate. Equity items, such as share capital or reserves, are converted at their historical foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses included in the income statement are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign exchange impacts resulting from this conversion are recognised as a separate component of shareholders' equity. In the event of exit from the foreign operation (disposal, repayment of capital, liquidation, discontinuation of activity) or in the event of deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without disposal), these conversion differences are recognised in the income statement when the result of exit or loss of control is recognised.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS - GOODWILL\n\n## Valuation and recognition of goodwill\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3, except for business combinations under  common  control,  which  are  excluded  from  the  scope of  application  of  IFRS  3.  In  the  absence  of  an  IFRS  standard or  interpretation  specifically  applicable  to  a  transaction,  IAS  8 'Accounting principles, changes in accounting estimates and errors' leaves open the possibility of referring to the official positions of other standard-setting bodies. Accordingly, the Group has elected to apply US standard ASU 805-50, which seems to comply with the IFRS general principles, for entering business combinations under common  control  at  carrying  amount  using  the  pooled  interests method.\n\nOn the date on which control is obtained, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree which meet the recognition conditions of IFRS 3 are recognised at fair value.\n\nPrice adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value, even if their realisation is not probable. Subsequent changes in fair value of the clauses, which have the characteristics of financial debt, are recognised in profit or loss. Only those price adjustment clauses relating to operations where the acquisition of control took place before 31 December 2009 May still be recognised against goodwill, as such transactions were initially recognised under non-revised IFRS 3 standard (2004).\n\nThe non-controlling interests that are shares of current interests giving rights to a share of the net assets in the event of liquidation may be measured, at acquirer's choice, in two ways:\n\n- z at fair value at the acquisition date ('full goodwill' method);\n- z at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThis option may be exercised on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nThe initial measurement of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities may be adjusted within a maximum period of twelve months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe transferred consideration at the time of a business combination (the acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values transferred by the acquirer, on the date of acquisition, in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments, etc.).\n\nCosts  directly  attributable  to  the  combination  in  question  are recognised in expenses, separately from the combination. If the transaction  is  highly  probable,  they  are  recognised  under  the heading 'Net gains or losses on other assets', otherwise they are recognised under 'Other operating income and expense'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the acquisition cost and noncontrolling interests, and the net balance, at the acquisition date, of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value, is recognised, where positive, as an asset in the consolidated balance  sheet,  in  the  heading  'Goodwill'.  If  this  difference  is negative, it is immediately recognised through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  at  its  initial  cost denominated in the acquiree's currency and translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\nIn the event of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree shall be remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value through profit or loss, and goodwill is computed only once, on the basis of the acquisitiondate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nIn the event of a loss of control, the result of the disposal is calculated for the entirety of the entity sold and any residual investment share retained is recognised in the balance sheet at its fair value at the date of loss of control.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is subject to impairment testing as soon as there are objective indicators of a loss of value and at least once per year.\n\nThe  choices  and  assumptions  made  in  the  valuation  of  noncontrolling interests at the date of acquisition may influence the amount of initial goodwill and any potential impairment resulting from a loss in value.",

        "page_content": "For the purposes of these impairment tests, each item of goodwill is allocated to the various cash generating units (CGUs) of the Group that will benefit from the advantages expected to accrue from the business combination. CGUs were defined as the smallest identifiable grouping of assets and liabilities operating according to its own business model. In practice, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances uses an entity-based approach.\n\nUnder the impairment tests, the carrying amount of each CGU, including that of the goodwill allocated to it, is compared to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value in use is calculated as the current value of estimated future cash flows from the CGU, as based on the medium-term plans drawn up for steering purposes of the Group.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the goodwill allocated to the CGU is impaired proportionately. This impairment is irreversible.\n\n## Changes to the post-acquisition percentage ownership interest and goodwill\n\nWhere there is an increase or decrease in the percentage of ownership interest held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in an entity over which it already exercises exclusive control, without loss of control, there is no impact on the amount of goodwill initially recognised for the business combination.\n\nWhere there is an increase in the percentage of ownership interest held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances in an entity over which it already exercises exclusive control, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised as a reduction in 'Retained earnings and other reserves'.\n\nWhere there is a decrease in the percentage of ownership interest held  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  in  an  entity  that  remains exclusively controlled, the difference between the disposal price and the carrying amount of the share of net assets sold is also recognised directly in 'Retained earnings and other reserves'. Costs relating to such transactions are recognised in equity.\n\n## NOTE 2 Main struct ural transactions and significant events during the period\n\nThe scope of consolidation and its changes as at 31 December 2023 are described in detail at the end of the notes to the financial statements, in note 11 'Consolidation scope'.\n\n## Partnership with Banco BPM\n\nOn 14  December 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances finalised the acquisition from Banco BPM of a 65% stake in Vera Assicurazioni, its subsidiary Vera Protezione and Banco BPM Assicurazioni. These acquisitions  enabled  the  launch  of  the  long-term  distribution\n\nagreement  signed  at  the  end  of  2022  between  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances and Banco BPM, aimed at providing non-life, provident and creditor insurance products through Banco BPM's distribution networks in Italy.\n\n## Transactions on subordinated debt\n\n## ISSUE OF A NEW SUBORDINATED DEBT\n\nOn 25 October 2023, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances issued \u20ac500 million of fixed-rate subordinated bonds with a 10-year maturity.\n\n## Pension reform\n\nThe impact of the pension reform in France adopted through the Law 2023-270 of 14 April 2023 on the corrective financing of social security for 2023 (published in the Journal Officiel of 15 April 2023) and the implementing decrees 2023-435 and 2023-436 of 3 June 2023 (published in the Journal Officiel of 4 June 2023) was taken into account in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Pillar 2 - Globe\n\nNew international tax rules have been established by the OECD, designed to subject large international groups to additional taxation when the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of a jurisdiction in which they are based is below 15%. The aim of these rules is to combat competition between countries based on tax rates.\n\nThese rules will have to be transposed by the various States.\n\n## EARLY PARTIAL REDEMPTIONS\n\nFollowing  this  new  issue,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  made redemption offers for two perpetual subordinated debt issued in 2014 and 2015 for \u20ac1 billion and \u20ac750 million respectively. These two perpetual subordinated debt were therefore partially redeemed early on 26 October 2023, for \u20ac380 million and \u20ac120 million respectively, for a total amount of \u20ac500 million.\n\nThe impact of this reform is considered to be a regime change and is recognised as past service costs, in other current operating income and expenses.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the impact of this reform is not significant for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group (\u20ac0.2 million).\n\nWithin the EU, a European Directive was adopted at the end of 2022  (currently  being  transposed  in  the  various  states ),  and provides for 2024 as the first year of application of the GloBE rules in the EU. At this stage, based on an initial costing, the amounts estimated for the Group are not significant. If necessary, this will result in the recognition of an additional GloBE tax in the Group's accounts in 2024.\n\n1 6",

The value in use is calculated on the basis of the updated estimate of the CGU's discounted future cash flows as a result of medium-term plans established for the Group's steering needs. The following assumptions were made:\n\n- z estimated future cash flows: projections mainly over a horizon of 3 to 5 years established for the Group's steering needs;\n- z long term growth rate: 2%;\n- z discount rate: different rates for each region, from 7.9% to 9.69%.\n\nG oodwill values as at 31 December 2023 are justified.\n\nFurthermore, the sensitivity tests performed show that a variation of +50 basis points in discount rates would not result in any significant impairment.\n\n- z equity allocated to insurance activities relates to projected solvency requirements taking account of each entity's economical situation in terms of subordinated debt;\n\n<!-- image -->",

These independent property experts use a combination of several valuation methods to establish a market value. The weighting of each of these methods in relation to another requires a degree of judgement and varies according to the specific market characteristics of each property (location, type of property i.e. residential, commercial or office, etc.).\n\nThe main valuation methods and related key assumptions are as follows:\n\n- z the capitalisation method, which consists of capitalising the income that the property is likely to generate, by applying a capitalisation rate to a rental value, generally determined by comparison with the rents charged for properties of the same type located in the property's geographical area. The other key assumptions used are rent indexation rates for future years and the average time taken to market vacant space;\n- z the comparison method, which consists of determining a metric market value using terms of comparison based on sales of identical or similar properties;\n- z the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, which involves discounting expected gross or net cash flows over a given period. This method is based on two main assumptions: the cash flows that will be generated and the rent indexation assumptions for future years, and the discount rate used.\n\nThe  valuation  of  investment  properties  takes  account  of  any investment  plans  to  meet  regulatory  requirements  relating  to climate change, such as the tertiary sector decree for commercial and office property, and the new rules on energy diagnostics for residential property.\n\n1 6",

These are subject to change in subsequent periods due to developments in market conditions or other factors.\n\nThe calculations represent best estimates. They are based on a number of assumptions. It is assumed that market participants act in their best economic interest.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  these  models  contain  uncertainties,  the  fair values shown may not be achieved upon actual sale or immediate settlement of the financial instruments concerned.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities is broken down according to the general observability criteria of the valuation inputs, pursuant to the principles defined under IFRS 13.\n\nLevel  1 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities quoted in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 applies to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with observable inputs. This agreement includes market data relating to interest rate risk or credit risk when the latter can be revalued based on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread. Securities bought or sold under repurchase agreements with underlyings quoted in an active market are also included in Level 2 of the hierarchy, as are financial assets and liabilities with a demand component for which fair value is measured at unadjusted amortised cost.\n\nLevel 3 indicates the fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable inputs or for which some data can be revalued using internal models based on historical data. This mainly includes market data relating to credit risk or early redemption risk.\n\nIn some cases, market values are close to carrying amounts. This applies primarily to:\n\n- z assets or liabilities at variable rates for which interest rate changes do not have a significant influence on the fair value, since the rates on these instruments frequently adjust themselves to the market rates;\n- z short-term assets or liabilities where the redemption value is considered to be close to the market value;\n- z instruments executed on a regulated market for which the prices are set by the public authorities;\n\n- z demand assets and liabilities;\n- z transactions for which there are no reliable observable data.\n\n## 6.5.1 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT AMORTISED COST AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nAmounts presented below include accruals and prepayments and are, for assets, net of impairment.\n\nIFRS 7 requires disclosures about financial instruments that are not recognised at fair value.\n\nAs a reminder, financial assets must be recognised at amortised cost if they are managed in a portfolio whose management objective is to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the assets and whose sales are strictly controlled and limited, and if they comply with the SPPI (Solely Payments of Principal and Interests) test. This test is satisfied when the financing only entitles the borrower to repayment of the principal and when payment of the interest received reflects the time value of money, the credit risk associated with the instrument, the other costs and risks of a conventional loan contract plus a reasonable margin, whether the interest rate is fixed or variable.\n\nIn this respect, information on the fair value of these instruments should be analysed with particular care:\n\n- z T he fair values shown represent an estimate of the market value at 31 December 2023. Nevertheless, these market values may be subject to variation depending on market parameters, in particular changes in interest rates and the quality of the counterparties' credit risk. Given the management model for these financial assets, their derecognition, which, unless explicitly provided for by IFRS 9, must take place at or near maturity, should be at a value close to the redemption value of these instruments. Therefore, the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount does not represent a realisable value from a business continuity perspective.\n- z G iven the management model for these financial assets, which consists of collecting cash flows from these assets, it should be noted that these financial instruments are not managed on the basis of changes in their fair value and that their performance is assessed on the basis of the contractual cash flows received over the life of the instrument.\n- z T he estimation of the indicative fair value of instruments carried at amortised cost is subject to the use of valuation models, particularly for those whose valuation is based on unobservable level 3 figures.",

Under the full retrospective approach, the Group shall at the transition date (1 January 2022):\n\n- z identify, recognise and measure each group of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied;\n- z identify, recognise and measure any assets for insurance acquisition cash flows as if IFRS 17 had always applied (except it is not required to apply their recoverability assessment before the transition date);\n- z derecognise any existing balances that would not exist had IFRS 17 always applied;\n- z recognise any resulting net difference in equity.\n\nIf, and  only  if,  a  retrospective  application  of  the  standard  is impracticable for the measurement of a group of insurance contracts or an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows, the Group is allowed to  apply  either  of  the  two  alternative  approaches  provided  by the transition provisions of the standard (modified retrospective approach or fair value approach).\n\nAt the transition date, being 1 January 2022, the Group applied the full retrospective approach to measure the most recent property and casualty insurance contracts (measured according to the PAA model), as well as the pensions insurance contracts of the general fund of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Retraite.\n\nThe Group had recourse to the modified retrospective approach to measure the other groups of insurance contracts recognised at the transition date. The Group did not resort to the fair value approach. For the groups of contracts concerned, the Group judged that the application of the full retrospective approach was impracticable because of the unavailability of all information required for a full retrospective application of the standard (as regards data collected, but also hypotheses or estimates that would have been made during preceding periods).\n\nThe  objective  of  the  modified  retrospective  approach  (MRA)  is to  achieve  the  closest  outcome  to  full  retrospective  application possible using reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort.\n\nTo this end, this approach contains a list of modifications in several fields; it is permitted to use each of these modifications only to the extent that reasonable and supportable information needed to apply a full retrospective approach is not available on this point.\n\nThe main modifications of the modified retrospective approach to which the Group resorted to measure certain groups of contracts at the transition date are the following:\n\n- z the identification of groups of insurance contracts and the determination of contracts meeting the definition of insurance contracts with discretionary participation features using information available at the transition date;\n- z the exemption from the requirement to divide groups so that they do not include contracts issued more than one year apart;\n\n- z the determination of the CSM (or the loss component) for groups of insurance contracts without direct participation features at the transition date, notably:\n- z the estimation of the future cash flows at the date of initial recognition as the amount of the future cash flows at the transition date, adjusted by the cash flows that are known to have occurred between the date of initial recognition and the transition date,\n- z the determination of the discount rates that applied at the date of initial recognition, via the use of a yield curve estimated at the date corresponding to the average age of the contracts in the group,\n- z the determination of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at the date of initial recognition by adjusting the risk adjustment for non-financial risk at the transition date by the expected release of risk before the transition date,\n- z the use of discount rates that apply at the date of initial recognition as determined above to calculate interests accreted on the CSM,\n- z the determination of the amount of the CSM recognised in profit or loss because of the transfer of services before the transition date, by comparing the remaining coverage units at that date with the coverage units provided under the group of contracts before the transition date;\n- z the determination of the CSM (or the loss component) for groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features at the transition date, by calculating a proxy for the total CSM for all services to be provided under the group of contracts (fair value of the underlying items minus fulfilment cash flows at that date, and adjusted for amounts charged to the policyholders before that date, for amounts paid before that date that would not have varied based on the underlying items, for the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk caused by the release from risk before that date, and for insurance acquisition cash flows incurred before the transition date that are allocated to the group) and by deducting from the latter the amount of CSM that relates to services provided before that date;\n- z the determination, in case the OCI option is applied, of the cumulative amount of insurance finance income or expenses recognised in equity at the transition date:\n- z for groups of insurance contracts without direct participation features: either by using discount rates that apply at the date of initial recognition as determined above, or by determining it as nil,\n- z for groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features for which the entity holds the underlying items: by determining it as equal to the cumulative amount recognised in equity on the underlying items.\n\nAt  the  transition  date,  the  Group  did  not  apply  the  modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach to identify and measure assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.",

The Group has developed and implemented a risk management structure designed to identify, assess, control and monitor the risks associated with its business. By relying on this structure, the Group aims at meeting its obligations towards its policyholders, clients and creditors, managing its capital efficiently and complying with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe general framework for risk management within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group is presented in Section 5 'Risk factors and risk management', of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nWith regard to the risks arising from contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS 17, information on insurance risk and financial risks arising from these contracts and on the management of these risks is provided below.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Assurances  Group  issues  insurance  contracts and  investment  contracts  (see  note  1  'Accounting  policies  and principles',  and  note  6.19  'Insurance  and  reinsurance  contracts' above). The nature and extent of the underwriting and financial risks arising from these contracts are determined by the characteristics of the different contracts. The risks are assessed for risk management purposes in relation to the risks mitigated by related reinsurance contracts and the risks arising from financial assets held to fund the settlement of insurance liabilities. The extent to which profit or loss and equity in a given period are sensitive to financial risks depends on the extent to which they are economically hedged or borne by the policyholders and the extent of any accounting mismatches inherent in the accounting policies adopted by the Group.\n\nGiven the diversity of its insurance activities, the Group is exposed to the following risks arising from its various contracts:\n\n- z underwriting risks:\n- z insurance risks (in particular mortality risk, morbidity risk, longevity risk, drift in claims  risk) ;\n- z expense risk;\n- z risk  linked  to  policyholder  behaviour  (particularly  risk  of surrender);\n- z financial risks:\n- z market risk, which includes three types of risk:\n- -interest rate risk;\n- -price risk;\n- -currency risk;\n- z credit risk;\n- z liquidity risk.\n\n## 6. 19.6.1 Underwriting  risk\n\nThrough  its  subsidiaries  in  France  and  abroad,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances  Group  is  active  in  savings/retirement,  death  and disability/creditor/Group  insurance  and  property  and  casualty insurance.\n\nThe insurance business exposes the Group to underwriting risks.\n\nUnderwriting risks include:\n\n- z insurance risk: the risk, other than financial risk, transferred from policyholders to the Group, arising from the coverage of uncertain future events and the inherent uncertainty about the occurrence, amount and timing of the resulting claims;\n- z the risk linked to policyholder behaviour: in particular surrender risk;\n- z expense risk: the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract, rather than in the costs associated with insured events.\n\nThe  Group's  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for  managing underwriting risks are as follows.\n\nThe Group's objective is to have sufficient resources to cover the liabilities relating to the insurance and reinsurance contracts it issues. Risk exposure is mitigated by diversification within the insurance contracts portfolios. Risk variability is also improved by rigorous selection and implementation of underwriting strategy guidelines, which aim at ensuring that the risks underwritten are diversified in terms of type of risk or level of benefits insured, as well as the use of reinsurance cession programmes.\n\nIn the savings business, the main underwriting risk to which the Group is exposed is surrender risk. Surrender risk may materialize, for example, in an environment of rapidly rising interest rates.\n\nThe  management  of  this  risk  involves  closer  monitoring  of policyholder behaviour, a competitive profit-sharing policy aimed at building policyholder loyalty, a prudent financial policy, particularly in the management of reserves, and the use of surrender penalties.\n\nThe surrender rate is monitored at several levels:\n\n- z surrender rates are monitored on a monthly basis by the entities concerned in order to detect any cyclical drift;\n- z quarterly monitoring is also used to compare surrender rates with those of the market.\n\nThese types of business also expose the Group to insurance risk, and more specifically to mortality risk (risk of the policyholder dying earlier than expected). Indeed, some multi-fund contracts include a guarantee committing the insurer to pay a minimum capital sum to the beneficiaries in the event of the policyholder's death ( i.e. a guaranteed minimum benefit).\n\nThe insurance risk to which the Group is exposed in its retirement business is longevity risk (risk of the policyholder dying later than expected), which arises from the annuity phase.",

        "page_content": "The Group is also exposed to insurance risks (in particular mortality, longevity, morbidity, pandemic, permanent and temporary disability) in its death and disability and creditor insurance business.\n\nThe  underwriting  policy,  which  defines  the  risks  insured,  the underwriting conditions (target clients, cover exclusions) and the pricing standards (in particular the statistical tables used, based on national and international statistics or experience tables), all contribute to managing insurance risk.\n\nThe main risks to which the Group is exposed in its property and casualty insurance business are the unknown frequency and severity of claims, which are influenced by the nature of the risks covered and the geographical location in which the risks are underwritten. These claims may arise from the risk of disaster (including extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, fires or storms, and other natural disasters such as earthquakes) or from the occurrence of individual large ('severe') claims. In addition, the increased climate risk could introduce significant uncertainty into the assumptions and thus potentially lead to more and higher claims than anticipated, as well as to inadequate pricing of insurance risk.\n\nThis risk is managed by means of:\n\n- z an appropriate underwriting (and pricing) policy, diversified within the same territory;\n- z coordination of the underwriting policy through banking networks and financial partners;\n- z a claims management policy carried out by dedicated management units, French or multi-country platforms, or delegated to local service providers;\n\n## Se nsitivity  analysis\n\nThe table below presents the impact on the CSM, profit or loss and equity of changes that were reasonably possible in the main insurance  risk  variables  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  ( i.e. mortality risk and drift in claims ). This analysis presents sensitivities before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance contracts held and assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Claims related to disaster risk and large claims are monitored by tracking the consumption of a weather claims budget and a severe claims budget.\n\nFinally, the Group is exposed to expense risk in all its business, i.e. the risk of unexpected increases in the administrative costs associated with the servicing of a contract (such as operating expenses and commissions paid to distributors). This risk is managed through budget exercises and regular cost assessments.\n\nThe nature of the Group's exposure to underwriting risks and its objectives, policies and processes used for managing and measuring these risks have not changed from the previous period.\n\nWith regard to the geographical concentration of underwriting risk, the Group is mainly exposed to the French and Italian markets, which account for 86.9% and 9.7% respectively of revenue and 88.8% and 6.7% respectively of the carrying amount of insurance contracts at 31/12/2023.\n\nWith regard to its business, the Group's core business is savings and retirement, which accounted for 71% of revenue at 31/12/2023.\n\ncorrelation of variables will have a significant effect on determining the ultimate impacts, but to demonstrate the impact of changes in each variable, the variables had to be changed on an individual basis.\n\nThe sensitivities are based on the assumption of a 10% change in mortality risk (upwards/downwards) and a 5% change in the claims (upwards/downwards).\n\nThe impacts on profit or loss and equity are presented net of deferred tax.\n\n|              | 31/12/2023            | 31/12/2023          | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2023            | 31/12/2023          |\n|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|              | Impact on CSM         | Impact on CSM       | Impact on profit or loss | Impact on profit or loss | Impact on equity      | Impact on equity    |\n|              | Gross of  reinsurance | Net of  reinsurance | Gross of  reinsurance    | Net of  reinsurance      | Gross of  reinsurance | Net of  reinsurance |\n| 10% increase | (411)                 | (448)               | 4                        | -                        | 6                     | 10                  |\n| 10% decrease | 414                   | 468                 | (7)                      | (3)                      | (4)                   | (10)                |\n| 5% increase  |                       |                     | (210)                    | (182)                    | (202)                 | (176)               |\n| 5% decrease  |                       |                     | 207                      | 179                      | 199                   | 174                 |\n\n|                 |              | 31/12/2022            | 31/12/2022          | 31/12/2022               | 31/12/2022               | 31/12/2022            | 31/12/2022          |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|                 |              | Impact on CSM         | Impact on CSM       | Impact on profit or loss | Impact on profit or loss | Impact on equity      | Impact on equity    |\n| (in \u20ac million)  |              | Gross of  reinsurance | Net of  reinsurance | Gross of  reinsurance    | Net of  reinsurance      | Gross of  reinsurance | Net of  reinsurance |\n|                 | 10% increase | (273)                 | (349)               | 11                       | 1                        | (4)                   | (34)                |\n| Mortality       | 10% decrease | 306                   | 380                 | (3)                      | 3                        | 12                    | 41                  |\n| Drift in claims | 5% increase  |                       |                     | (194)                    | (165)                    | (367)                 | (313)               |\n| Drift in claims | 5% decrease  |                       |                     | 190                      | 161                      | 359                   | 306                 |\n\n1 6",

It comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.\n\nThis risk arises from the variability of the fair values of financial instruments or the associated future cash flows, as well as from the variability of fulfilment cash flows of insurance contracts due to the variability of market risk variables.\n\nMarket risk arises primarily from the Group's investments in equity instruments,  interest-bearing  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  and financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, but these exposures are largely offset by similar exposures on insurance and reinsurance contracts.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is mainly exposed to interest rate risk and to price risk on equities and so-called 'diversification' assets. It is only marginally exposed to currency risk.\n\nThe Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing market risks are as follows.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to control exposures to market risks within acceptable limits while optimising the return on this risk.\n\nInformation  on  the  management  of  market  risk  relating  to financial instruments is provided in Section 5 'Risk factors and risk management' of the Universal Registration Document. Qualitative information on the measurement of the carrying amount and the fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  provided  in  the  'Financial instruments'  section  of  note  1  'Accounting  policies'  above. Quantitative  information  on  the  carrying  amount  of  financial instruments is provided in note  6.4 'Investments from insurance activities' of the financial statements above. Quantitative information on the fair value of financial instruments is provided in notes 6.5.1.1 'Fair value of financial assets recognised at amortised cost on the balance  sheet'  and  6.5.2  'Information  on  financial  instruments measured at fair value' of the financial statements above.\n\nWith regard to market risk arising from contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS 17, information is detailed below for each type of market risk. The Group manages its assets and liabilities within an asset-liability management framework that has been developed with  the  objective  of  matching  the  cash  flows  arising  from  its financial investments with the cash flows arising from its insurance contracts, while optimising the long-term return on its investments for an acceptable level of risk. For insurance contracts with direct participation features (corresponding mainly to the Group's savings and retirement business), changes in the fair value of the underlying items due to changes in market variables are reflected in the value of the related insurance contracts; the Group is therefore exposed mainly to market risk in respect of changes in its share of the fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThe nature of the Group's exposure to market risk and its objectives, policies and processes used for managing and measuring this risk have not changed from the previous period.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument, and the fulfilment cash flows of an insurance or reinsurance contract, will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates to debt instruments and all insurance contracts.\n\nThe Group's exposure to debt instruments is disclosed in note 6.4 'Investments from insurance activities' of the financial statements above.\n\nThe Group's exposure to insurance contracts is disclosed in note 6.19 'Insurance and reinsurance contracts' above.\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the value of its investments in debt instruments compared with the value of the insurance contracts that are backed by these investments.\n\nThe sensitivity relating to the insurance contracts arises from the following effects.\n\nFor  insurance  contracts  without  direct  participation  features (corresponding mainly to the death and disability, creditor, property and casualty business): fulfilment cash flows are discounted using a discount rate curve that depends on interest rates prevailing at the closing date. The risk relates mainly to the extent to which investment return matches insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nFor insurance contracts with direct participation features (corresponding  mainly  to  the  savings  and  retirement  business): changes in the value of insurance contracts reflect changes in the value of the underlying financial assets. The risk relates mainly to changes in the insurer's share of the fair value of the underlying financial assets.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts, the interest rate risk is largely borne by policyholders. On the other hand, for euro-denominated contracts, the  presence  of  guaranteed  minimum  rates  to  policyholders increases this risk.\n\nThe  Group  manages  interest  rate  risk  within  an  overall  assetliability management framework aimed at matching the duration of  the  investment  portfolio  with  that  of  insurance  contracts. This  management  combines  several  aspects:  financial  strategy, commercial policy, accounting aspects and financial performance, while taking into account the Group's appetite for risk and local regulatory constraints.\n\nTo  this  end,  the  Group  relies  on  a  system  of  interest  rate  risk management that includes risk limits and an associated governance (asset-liability committee, presentation of stress scenarios to the Board of Directors, etc.).\n\nThese  limits  are  calibrated  according  to  the  nature  of  the counterparty:\n\n- z for sovereigns and similar exposures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group takes into account the debt-to-GDP ratio and the country's rating;\n- z for financial or industrial companies, the Group adjusts the limits according to the rating and supplements them with a Group issuer approach;\n- z for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group, the measurement of the exposure includes as a precaution a proportion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole unit-linked bonds, in order to incorporate the potential carry risk in the event of a surge in surrenders.\n\nThe utilisation of these limits is monitored monthly, so that the appropriate level of Group management is informed of any corrective measures that need to be taken if these limits are exceeded.\n\nThe Group also uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk (caps to hedge against rising interest rates, floors, swaps to reduce the risk of reinvestment in the event of falling interest rates).\n\nGiven  the  concentration  limits  governing  the  exposure  to  debt instruments  mentioned  above,  the  Group  has  no  significant concentration of interest rate risk.",

With regard to insurance contracts, the Group is exposed to the risk arising from fluctuations in the prices of these assets only in the scope of insurance contracts with direct participation features (which correspond mainly to the savings and retirement business), due to the impact that such fluctuations could have on the change in the insurer's share of the fair value of the underlying financial\n\nassets. However, on unit-linked commitments (amounting to \u20ac94 362 million at 31/12/2023), this risk is significantly mitigated because it is largely transferred to policyholders.\n\nIn order to manage this risk, asset allocation studies are carried out to determine a ceiling for the proportion of these equities and diversification assets, and a level of price volatility that must not be exceeded.\n\nLimits are set globally for diversification investments  and individually for each asset class (equities, property, private equity and infrastructure, and alternative management). Compliance with these limits is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\nGiven  the  abovementioned  concentration  limits  on  exposure  to equities  and  diversification  assets,  the  Group  has  no  significant concentration of price risk.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table below presents the impact on the CSM, profit or loss and equity of changes in share values that were reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. This analysis presents the impact on the measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts and financial investments, and assumes that all other variables remain constant. In practice, the correlation of variables will have a significant effect on determining the ultimate impacts, but to demonstrate the impact of changes in each variable, the variables had to be changed on an individual basis.\n\nThe sensitivities below have been calculated for equity risk, assuming a 10% rise and fall in the share value.\n\n1 6",

At Group level, such transactions are marginal. The Group's financial assets are almost exclusively denominated in the same currencies as its insurance liabilities.\n\nThis  exposure  is  managed  by  applying  a  currency  risk  hedging strategy,  whether  for  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is different from that of the Group, or for financial instruments and insurance  contracts  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the functional currencies of the entities.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole   Assurances  Group's  exposure  to  currency  risk consists in:\n\n- z a limited structural exposure, in yen for its Japanese subsidiary CA Life Japan, and in zloty for its Polish subsidiary CA Zycie. The associated currency risk is managed via an accounting hedging of the net investment in these subsidiaries using foreign currency\n\nborrowings (NIH hedging: net investment hedge in a foreign operation); the hedging ratio is 93% (unhedged net exposure of \u20ac7.7 million) for CA Life Japan and 84% for CA Zycie (unhedged net exposure of \u20ac4.4 million) at 31/12/2023;\n\n- z an operational exposure resulting from the mismatch between the currencies of financial assets and of insurance liabilities. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group's overall portfolio, representing commitments in euro, is mainly invested in financial instruments denominated in euro. However, in order to optimise the risk/return ratio and seek diversification, dedicated funds and fixed income mandates seek to benefit from anticipated growth lags and interest rate discrepancies between major geographical areas. The currency hedging strategy consists of not hedging the currencies of emerging countries, regardless of the asset class, and instead hedging the currencies of developed countries, with the possibility of limited tactical exposure to a single currency, the US dollar. Overall, the currency exposure at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group level is constrained by a market value limit in relation to the total portfolio and two sublimits for emerging currencies and the US dollar.\n\nAs the Group is only marginally exposed to this risk, it has no significant concentration of currency risk.\n\nAs a result, changes in exchange rates that were reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period do not have a material impact on the CSM, profit or loss and equity.",

Qualitative information on the determination of expected credit losses is provided in the 'Financial instruments' section of note 1 'Accounting policies and principles' above. Quantitative information on loss allowances, credit risk exposure and measurement of the concentration of credit risk is provided in note 6.7 'Credit risk' of the financial statements above.\n\nFor  the  Group,  credit  risk  arises  primarily  from  its  reinsurance contracts held and its investments in debt instruments.\n\n1 6",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to credit risk arising from contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS  17, the credit risk associated with future premium inflows from insurance contracts issued is mitigated by the Group's ability to terminate insurance contract services when policyholders default  on  their  obligation  to  pay  premiums,  resulting  in  an insignificant credit risk exposure for these contracts.\n\nCredit risk therefore relates mainly to reinsurance contracts held (the risk of a reinsurer defaulting, with the result that it is no longer able to pay its due share).\n\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the liabilities of the underlying insurance contracts and in accordance with the reinsurance contracts (see note  1 on accounting policies and principles). The conclusion of reinsurance programmes  by  the  Group  does  not  release  it  from  its  direct obligations to policyholders, and there is therefore a credit risk in respect of reinsurance cessions, insofar as the reinsurer may not be able to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract.\n\nEach entity establishes its own reinsurance policy, which incorporates risk management principles that are consistent throughout Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group.\n\nThe management of the risk of default of reinsurers is based on the Group's internal standards:\n\n- z firstly, contracting with reinsurers meeting a minimum financial strength criterion (A-), compliance with which is monitored throughout the relationship;\n- z rules for diversifying reinsurers (by treaty) and limiting the concentration of premiums ceded to a single reinsurer, defined by each of the entities that monitors them; the Group monitors the concentration of premiums ceded globally, by reinsurer;\n- z securing the provisions ceded by means of standard collateral clauses.\n\nIn addition, reinsurance plans are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors of each entity.\n\nThe nature of the Group's exposure to credit risk and its objectives, policies and processes used formanaging and measuring this risk have not changed from the previous period.\n\nReinsurance counterparty risk, apart from internal reinsurance, is concentrated of up to 53% on the Caisse Centrale de R\u00e9assurance (CCR), a reinsurer 100% owned by the French state, rated AA-, entitled to provide a coverage for natural disaster risks in France, which is the main compensation regime for natural disasters in France. At the end of 2023, excluding CCR SA, the share of the first 5 reinsurers in the commitments amounts to 25%. The rating of these reinsurers is higher than A.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe amount that best represents the maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk at the end of the reporting period, for insurance contracts issued, is the amount of premium receivables: it represents \u20ac2 237 million as at 31/12/2023 (\u20ac2 052 million as at 31/12/2022).\n\n## Credit quality of reinsurance contracts held\n\nInformation about the credit quality of reinsurance contracts held that are assets is disclosed in the following table:\n\n|                                             | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in \u20ac million)                              | AAA          | AA+          | AA           | AA-          | A+           | A            | A-           | BBB+         | BBB          | NR           | Total        |\n| Reinsurance contracts  held that are assets | -            | 36           | 435          | 407          | 151          | 46           | 4            | -            | -            | 15           | 1,094        |\n\n31/12/2022\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                              | AAA   |   AA+ |   AA |   AA- |   A+ |   A |   A- | BBB+   |   BBB |   NR |   Total |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|------|-------|------|-----|------|--------|-------|------|---------|\n| Reinsurance contracts  held that are assets | -     |    32 |  221 |   441 |  138 |  92 |   35 | -      |     1 |   17 |     977 |\n\n## 6.19.6.5 Liquidity  risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in  meeting  obligations  associated  with  insurance  contracts  and financial liabilities that are to be settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.\n\nThe liquidity risk arising from contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS  17 is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations  as  they  fall  due  as  a  result  of  benefit  payments  to policyholders (in particular, in savings and retirement, surrenders and  deaths),  cash  requirements  from  contractual  commitments, or  other  cash  outflows.  Such  outflows  would  deplete  the  cash resources  available  for  insurance  and  investment  business.  In certain circumstances, the lack of liquidity could lead to the sale of assets at a loss, or potentially an inability to fulfil commitments\n\nto policyholders. The risk that the Group may be unable to fulfil its commitments to policyholders is inherent in all insurance operations and may be affected by a range of Group-specific and marked-wide events including, but not limited to, credit events, systemic shocks and natural disasters.\n\nThe Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing liquidity risk are as follows.\n\nThe Group's objective in managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its commitments as they fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nGroup entities use a combination of approaches to manage liquidity risk.",

        "page_content": "Firstly, liquidity is a criterion in selecting investments: a majority of securities listed on regulated markets, limiting assets that are by nature less liquid, such as physical real estate, private equity, unrated bonds, participations, and alternative management.\n\nIn addition, systems for managing liquidity, standardised at Group level,  are  defined  by  the  entities  as  part  of  their  asset-liability management, with indicators adapted to the different time horizons (short term, medium term, long term). For life insurance entities, liquidity risk is controlled and managed through three systems:\n\n- z long-term liquidity: monitoring and limiting annual cash gaps, estimated for the portfolio in run-off, to ensure congruence between asset maturities and commitments due dates, both under normal conditions and in a stressed environment (surge of surrenders/deaths);\n- z medium-term liquidity: calculation of an indicator known as the 'two-year reactivity rate', which measures the ability to mobilise short-term or variable-rate assets while limiting the impact in terms of capital loss. This indicator is compared with a minimum threshold defined by each entity to be able to absorb a surge of surrenders. In the face of the risk of an intense wave of surrenders should interest rates rise sharply, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also uses a liquidity monitoring indicator, which measures the ratio over a one-year horizon between stressed liquid assets (increased discount) and a liquidity requirement generated by a surrender rate of 40%;\n- z short-term liquidity: in the event of uncertainty over net inflows, setting minimum liquidity levels for one-week and one-month horizons, with daily monitoring of surrenders. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also has a surrender crisis management plan.\n\nTemporary  liquidity  management  mechanisms  have  also  been tested in the event of an exceptional situation where the markets are unavailable (testing of the circuit converting reserves into cash for Predica with the possibility to repo securities to the ECB via Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.).\n\nLife  entities  analyse  their  cash  gaps  in  order  to  identify  which maturities should be favoured or on the contrary avoided (excess\n\nmaturities, with interest rate risk on re-investment). Every month they use their performance indicator to monitor their reactivity ratio and liquidity monitoring indicator, compared with the thresholds they have set themselves. They also regularly monitor surrender rates and arbitrages between the euro-denominated fund and unitlinked products, so that, in the event of proven stress, they can be monitored at very short intervals.\n\nNon-life entities maintain liquid assets in proportions designed to respond to a drift in claims, taking into account their reinsurance programme.\n\nWhen interest rates rise, the value of debt instruments purchased in  a  low-rate  environment  falls,  leaving  the  portfolio  with  an unrealised loss. An unexpected increase in surrenders could require entities that have not taken the necessary measures to liquidate these fixed maturity investments in order to obtain cash to meet their commitments at a time when the prices of these assets are not favourable, which could result in significant realised losses for the Group. To remedy this situation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances has put in place systems to measure, monitor and control liquidity risk, in particular by building up reserves. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances also has significant sources to access cash, notably through the maturities of securities held and coupon and dividend receipts.\n\nThe nature of the Group's exposure to liquidity risk and its objectives, policies and processes used for managing and measuring this risk have not changed from the previous period.\n\nThe Group has no significant concentration of liquidity risk.\n\n## Breakdown of financial assets and liabilities by contractual maturity\n\nNote  6.6 'Breakdown of financial assets by contractual maturity' above shows the maturity profile of the Group's financial assets.\n\nNote  6.17.3  'Breakdown  of  financial  liabilities  by  contractual maturity' above provides information on the estimated maturity of the Group's financial liabilities.\n\n## Maturity analysis of insurance liabilities\n\nAn analysis, by estimated timing, of the estimates of the present value of the future cash flows is disclosed in the following table:\n\n|                                                       | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023              | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in \u20ac million)                                        | \u2264  1 year    | > 1 year to  \u2264  2 years | > 2 years to  \u2264  3 years | > 3 years to  \u2264  4 years | > 4 years to  \u2264  5 years | > 5 years    | Total        |\n| Insurance contracts issued that are liabilities       | 3,934        | 961                     | 2,223                    | 2,456                    | 2,585                    | 308,800      | 320,959      |\n| Life France                                           | (1,354)      | (2,458)                 | (315)                    | 216                      | 610                      | 288,248      | 284,948      |\n| Property and casualty France                          | 2,164        | 718                     | 556                      | 400                      | 276                      | 1,158        | 5,272        |\n| International                                         | 3,586        | 3,137                   | 2,437                    | 2,258                    | 2,074                    | 23,665       | 37,156       |\n| Intragroup                                            | (462)        | (435)                   | (455)                    | (419)                    | (376)                    | (4,270)      | (6,417)      |\n| Reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities       | 605          | 10                      | 6                        | 1                        | -                        | (349)        | 273          |\n| Life France                                           | 600          | 4                       | 2                        | (1)                      | -                        | (384)        | 221          |\n| Property and casualty France                          | -            | -                       | -                        | -                        | -                        | -            | -            |\n| International                                         | 5            | 5                       | 4                        | 2                        | -                        | 35           | 52           |\n| Intragroup                                            | -            | -                       | -                        | -                        | -                        | -            | -            |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS LIABILITIES | 4,539        | 971                     | 2,229                    | 2,457                    | 2,585                    | 308,451      | 321,232      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amounts vary according to practices and collective bargaining agreements.\n\nProvisions made by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group for these other employee benefits amounted to 8.58 million euros at the end of 2023.\n\n- z other long-term benefits: not applicable;\n- z termination benefits: not applicable;\n- z share-based payments: \u20ac0.2 million.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances perceived in 2023 a total of 152,000 euros in attendance fees under their mandate to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The minimum equity capital (solvency ratio), leverage ratio and liquidity ratio requirements limit the capacity of these entities to pay dividends or to transfer assets to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group.\n\n## Legal constraints\n\nThe subsidiaries of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Group are subject to  legal  provisions  concerning  the  distribution  of  capital  and distributable earnings. These requirements limit the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute dividends. In most cases, these are less restrictive than the regulatory limitations mentioned above.\n\n## Restriction on assets backing unit-linked contracts\n\nAssets of the insurance subsidiaries are mainly held for satisfying their  obligation  towards  their  policyholders.  Assets  transfers  to other entities are possible following the legal conditions. However, in case of a transfer, a part of the profit due to the transfer must be intended for the policyholders.\n\n## FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CONTROLLED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances provided no financial support for any structured entities consolidated neither as of 31 December 2023 nor as of 31 December 2022.\n\n## NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nNo subsidiary has been identified with significant amount of noncontrolling interests in relation to the total equity of the Group or of the sub-group level or of which the total balance sheet held by non-controlling interests is significant.\n\n## SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION EVOLUTION\n\nThe Group consolidated 558 entities at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe entities Vaugirard Fibra, Vaugirard Factory, SAS Commerces 2, Vaugirard Longueil, SCI  11 place de l'Europe and IMEFA 163 (fully consolidated) were consolidated for the first time and 4 entities at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nOf these 558 entities, 333 structured funds are consolidated by the Group, including 22 entities for the first time, representing a total of \u20ac11,296 million in debt to consolidated UCITS unitholders.",

Insurance company investments are used to fulfil commitments to policyholders throughout the insurance contracts' lifetime. Their value and returns are correlated with these commitments.\n\nIn this regard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances invests in three types of vehicles:\n\n## UCITS\n\nThis category covers standard investment funds, whether or not listed, such as FCPs, SICAVs, FCPRs or similar foreign funds.\n\n## Real estate\n\nThe  following  are  included  in  the  category  of  non-consolidated structured entities: funds whose underlying assets are in real estate and especially OPCIs, SCPIs or foreign funds of the same nature, etc.\n\n## Other\n\nThis category covers so-called securitisation funds such as FCCs, FCTs or similar foreign funds, etc.\n\n## Sponsored entities\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  sponsors  structured  entities  in  the following instances:\n\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is involved in establishing the entity and that involvement, which is remunerated, is deemed essential for ensuring the proper completion of transactions;\n- z structuring takes place at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances and it is the main user thereof;\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances transfered its own assets to the structured entity;\n- z Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is the manager;\n- z the name of a subsidiary or of the parent company of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is linked to the name of the structured entity or to the financial instruments issued by it.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances  has  sponsored  non-consolidated structured  entities  in  which  it  no  longer  hosts  interests  at 31 December 2023.\n\nGross  income  of  sponsored  entities  in  which  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances no longer holds interests after the end of the period amounts to -\u20ac8 million at 31 December 2023.\n\n## INFORMATION ON THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERESTS HELD\n\n## Financial support provided to structured entities\n\nNo financial support was provided nor is planned with regard to non-consolidated structured entities for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Interests held in non-consolidated structured entities by type of business\n\nNon-sponsored structured entities generate no specific risk related to the nature of the entity. Disclosures concerning these exposures are set out in note 6.5 'Fair value of financial assets and liabilities'. These are investment funds in which the Group is not a manager, and structured financing entities in which the Group has only granted a loan.",

Its application was carried out retrospectively on insurance contracts in force at the transition date of January 1, 2022.\n\nThe Group has presented the impact of this new accounting standard in accordance with IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors', which includes correlative comparative information at January 1, 2022, as well as the impact of the accounting methods chosen on the opening balance of equity and on the contractual service margin of the opening balance sheet.\n\nThe primary financial statements and note 6.19.5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements present the qualitative and quantitative information required by the IFRS 17 standard as well as the main accounting method choices applied at the transition. The adoption of this new accounting standard led to a global impact of -\u20ac1.4 billion on equity at January 1, 2022 and to the establishment of a contractual service margin at opening with a gross amount before taxes of \u20ac20.1 billion.\n\nThe application of the IFRS 17 standard involves new accounting and actuarial estimates involving increased management judgment in the choice of appropriate accounting methods within the framework of transition and in the determination of assumptions and parameters. This includes, at the transition date:\n\n- z the  determination  of  the  applicable  transition  approach  for  each  group  of insurance  contracts  and  in  particular  the  assessment  of  cases  where  a  full retrospective  application  (FRA)  is  possible  and,  if  not,  the  evaluation  of the  transition  methodologies  of  groups  of  contracts  for  which  a  modified retrospective approach (MRA) has been implemented;\n- z the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the initial contractual service margin depending on the transition approach chosen. In particular, its amount was estimated mainly according to the modified retrospective approach due to the unavailability of all the information necessary for a full retrospective application, which led management to make certain simplifications, particularly in terms of contract grouping, discount rates, and reconstruction of past margins;\n- z the methods of presenting the impacts of these choices in the Group's equity, including those affecting 'other comprehensive income' (OCI) at the transition date.\n\nThe  importance  of  the  changes  in  the  valuation  and  recognition  of  liabilities under insurance contracts induced by this new accounting standard, the choice of accounting methods and the significant nature of management's judgments in determining certain key valuation assumptions, led us to consider the evaluation of the impact of the first application of the IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' standard on the opening balances and comparatives of the consolidated financial statements as a key audit matter.\n\nWith the help of our actuaries, we have carried out the following audit procedures:\n\n- z Understand and assess the processes and controls defined by management, including on the internal control environment of information systems involved in data processing, to determine the impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 on the consolidated financial statements at January 1, 2022, as well as on the comparative financial statements at December 31, 2022;\n- z Assess the validity of the accounting method choices and judgments made by management in accordance with the IFRS 17 standard;\n- z Assess  the  parameters  and  assumptions  used  in  the  transition  methods applied to calculate the contractual service margin according to the modified retrospective approach. In this context, we appreciated the evaluation and recognition modalities of the contractual service margin at January 1, 2022;\n- z Assess, with the help of our actuaries, the key methodologies and judgments used in determining actuarial valuation models in accordance with the IFRS 17 standard. We verified the implementation of these methods and assumptions as part of our audit procedures for comparative information for the 2022 yearended;\n- z Perform  tests,  based  on  samples  and  our  risk  assessment,  on  the  data, assumptions and key modeling parameters used in the calculation of the opening balances and the comparative statements presented;\n- z Assess the appropriateness of the information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relating to the transition to the new IFRS 17 standard in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The projection of these future cash flows incorporates assumptions about policyholder behavior and management decisions. These estimated flows are discounted to reflect the time value of money based on a risk-free rate curve adjusted by an illiquidity premium;\n- z the definition of the adjustment for non-financial risks intended to cover the uncertainty on the amount and timing of future cash flows generated by these risks. To evaluate this adjustment, the group has chosen to retain the 'Value at Risk' method with a 80% quantile, taking into account the diversification of risks at the level of each entity and between the entities of the group;\n- z the contractual service margin representing the unearned profit that the Group will recognize in the income statement as it provides the services provided for in  the  insurance  contracts.  For  contracts  with  direct  participation  elements, a  methodological  adjustment  consisted  in  taking  into  account  the  return corresponding  to  the  actual  performance  of  the  assets  in  representation compared to the return of the assets in a risk-neutral universe projected in the actuarial models.\n\nDue to the long-term horizon of the commitments related to insurance contracts evaluated according to the VFA and BBA models, their significant sensitivity to the economic and financial environment which can have an impact on the behavior of policyholders, the significant nature of management's judgment in the choice of data and assumptions, as well as the use of complex modeling techniques, we considered the measurement of technical provisions of insurance contracts evaluated according to the BBA and VFA models as a key audit matter.\n\nWith the help of our actuaries and IT auditors, we have carried out the following audit procedures:\n\n- z Understand  the  processes  and  methodologies  defined  by  the  group's management, as well as the associated governance, to determine, according to the principles of the IFRS 17 standard, the best estimate of the present value of future cash flows necessary to fulfill contractual obligations to policyholders of insurance contracts evaluated according to the VFA and BBA models;\n- z Evaluate the compliance of the accounting principles applied by the group with the IFRS 17 standard;\n- z Assess  the  eligibility  of  'savings  and  retirement'  insurance  contracts  for the VFA accounting valuation model and assess the correct application by management of these valuation methods to 'savings and retirement' insurance contracts in compliance with the IFRS 17 standard;\n- z Assess and test the key controls put in place by management, including on the  internal  control  environment  of  information  systems  involved  in  data processing.  In  this  context,  we  have,  in  particular,  evaluated  the  control mechanisms  relating  to  methodologies,  judgments  and  key  assumptions formulated by management. We also appreciated the adequacy of changes in assumptions, parameters or modeling of actuarial processes involved in the evaluation of future cash flows;\n- z Test, on a sample basis, the main methodologies, assumptions and key actuarial parameters used in determining the estimates of discounted future cash flows, the adjustment for non-financial risks and the contractual service margin. We appreciated, on a sample basis, the reasonableness of these estimates as well as the processes for determining the recognition in the income statement for the period of the adjustment for non-financial risks and the contractual service margin;\n- z Test, on a sample basis, the reliability of the underlying data used in projection models and calculations of the best estimate of discounted future cash flows;\n- z Perform analytical procedures on developments to identify any significant inconsistent or unexpected variation;\n- z Assess the appropriateness of the information communicated in the notes related to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of insurance liabilities for incurred claims according to the PA model (BE and RA)\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nPlease refer to notes 1 and 6.19.1.1 of the consolidated financial statements. Insurance  liabilities  for  incurred  claims  evaluated  according  to  the  PAA  model represent a significant amount as of December 31, 2023. These liabilities are made up of:\n\n- z an estimate of the present value of future cash flows for \u20ac5.5 billion corresponding to the ultimate cost of settling claims incurred and unpaid at the closing date and the value of expected recoveries, resulting from the application of deterministic statistical methods based on historical data and the use of actuarial assumptions involving expert judgments to estimate the ultimate charge. These estimated flows are discounted to reflect the time value of money using a bottom-up approach based on a risk-free rate curve adjusted by an illiquidity premium reflecting the characteristics of cash flows and the liquidity of insurance contracts;\n- z an adjustment for non-financial risk for \u20ac0.1 billion determined by applying the confidence level technique with a 85% quantile, taking into account the diversification of risks at the level of each entity and between the entities of the group.\n\nGiven the amount of these liabilities, the complexity of the actuarial methods necessary to estimate the best estimate of future cash flows, including the evaluation of the expected ultimate charge and the pace of claims development, and the risk margin and the judgment necessary to determine the discount rate, we considered the evaluation of insurance liabilities for incurred claims according to the PAA model as a key audit matter.\n\nWith the help of our actuaries, we have carried out the following procedures:\n\n- z Assessment of the methodologies used to estimate future cash flows and the risk margin in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17;\n- z Analysis of the relevance of the main assumptions used, including the pace of claims development and the quantile for the adjustment of non-financial risk, in relation to the characteristics of the portfolio and our audit experience;\n- z Assessment of the appropriateness of the discount rate curve used in relation to the estimation of the projections of the average return on general assets;\n- z Verification of the accuracy of the source data used to make these estimates, relying on the business and IT controls put in place by the group;\n- z Independent recalculation of the estimate of future cash flows for certain branches, particularly those with long development;\n- z Assessment of the appropriateness of the information produced in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

Please refer to note 6.5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe group's level 2 assets are mainly composed of shares and bonds listed on an inactive market valued by applying a method commonly used by market players and of over-the-counter instruments for which valuation is done using models that use observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 assets are mainly units of Risk Mutual Funds and unlisted equity securities valued using assumptions that are not supported by observable market data for the same instrument.\n\nThese valuations also take into account liquidity risk and counterparty risk, where applicable.\n\nWe consider the valuation of unlisted financial investments and investment property as a key audit matter due to the expert judgments and the variety and complexity of the methods used for their valuation.\n\n- z With the help of our valuation experts, we carried out the following procedures:\n- z Update of our knowledge of the internal control environment related to the valuation process of these financial investments and investments properties;\n- z for assets valued using internal valuation models:\n- z Assess the consistency of the assumptions, methods and inputs used in light of market practices and the economic context;\n- z Assess the valuations retained and recorded at December 31, 2023;\n- z for assets valued by external asset management companies to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Assurances Group and for investments properties:\n- z Comparison of the valuations retained at December 31, 2023 with the reports transmitted by asset management companies and real estate experts;\n- z for assets whose valuation was established at a date prior to the closing date: assess the analyses carried out by the Group to examine any significant difference between the retained valuations and the valuations at the closing date;\n- z Assess the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regarding the consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the markups in the financial statements comply with the format defined in the above-mentioned Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the single European electronic reporting format.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your Company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers ) correspond to those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the statutory auditors\n\nWe  were  appointed  Statutory  Auditors  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  May  5,  2008  for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and by the Annual General Meeting held on May 3, 2022 for MAZARS.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, our firms were respectively in the sixteenth consecutive year and the second year of their engagement and respectively the tenth and second year since the Company's securities were admitted to trading on a regulated market.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for implementing internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, any internal audit systems, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- z Obtain an understanding of internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- z Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n- z Assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.\n- z Evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- z Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821-7 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ).

Long-term  receivables  are,  where  applicable,\n\ndepreciated in order to reflect their current value at the end of the financial year.\n\n## 3.5 Marketable securities\n\nMa rketable securities are shown at their acquisition cost, at the end of the financial year, the cost of acquisition of marketable securities is compared with the book value (net asset value) in the case of SICAV and FCP and with the average market price of the last month of the financial year for other securities.\n\n## 3.6 Deferred expenses\n\nDeferred expenses correspond to issue costs.\n\nIssue costs and issue premiums are spread out over the duration of the loan if it has a definite term, or until the first date of exercise of the redemption option if it has an indefinite term.\n\n## 3.7 Other equity capital\n\nThi s includes debt with special terms attached, presented on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in an intermediate section named 'Other equity capital'.\n\nThese loans are valued at historical cost. The coupons represent financial expenses (the accrued coupons are recognised whether payment is deferred or not).\n\n## 3.8 Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions are booked when it is likely or certain that an obligation towards a third party will result in an outflow of resources to this third  party  without  receiving  at  least  an  equivalent  benefit  in exchange, and the maturity or amount of which is not set precisely but may be reliably estimated. This provision is stated at the amount\n\ncorresponding to the best estimate on the date of preparing the financial statements of the outflow of resources needed to settle this obligation.\n\n## 3.9 Subordinated debt\n\nThis i tem includes redeemable subordinated notes issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances S.A. both to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and on the market.\n\n## 3.10 Financial income and expe nses\n\nFinancial income and expenses principally include:\n\n- z interests  on  loans  taken  out  (expenses)  and  loans  granted to subsidiaries (income); these interests being calculated in accordance with the contractual conditions of these;\n- z dividends and interim dividends received;\n\n## 3.11 Taxation\n\nThe company beca me part of the tax consolidation mechanism of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 1 January 2007.\n\nAccording  to  the  tax  consolidation  agreement  between  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances S.A., the tax charge incurred  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Assurances  S.A.  in  respect  of  each\n\n- z coupons received (income) and, where applicable, realised capital gains and losses on the disposal of marketable securities (income or expenses);\n- z the provisions (expenses) and reversals (income) for amortisation of financial and investment security assets.\n\nconsolidation period is the same as it would have been if it had been taxed separately.\n\nThe company joined the VAT group of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group on 1 January 2023.\n\nIf there is an unrealised capital loss, a depreciation of the securities is recognised for the full amount of the capital loss.\n\nThe  impairments  recorded  on  financial  assets  are  due  to  the comparison of the value in use and the entry cost of these assets.\n\nUnrealised capital losses are subject to depreciation and are not offset against unrealised capital gains.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of the statutory auditors relating to the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- z identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- z obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- z evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;\n- z assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- z evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, April 3, 2024\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nG\u00e9rard Courr\u00e8ges\n\nAgn\u00e8s Hussherr\n\nMAZARS\n\nOlivier Leclerc\n\nJean Lator zeff\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  existence  of  the  shares is established by their registration in the name of their holder or holders in the accounts which are held for this purpose by the company under the terms and conditions provided by law.\n\nAt the shareholder's request, a certificate of registration shall be issued by the company.\n\n## Article 9 - Rights and obligations\n\n- 1. Subject to the rights that may be granted to shares of different categories which have been created, each share entitles the holder to a portion of the profits and corporate assets in proportion to the portion of share capital it represents. It also entitles the holder to vote and to be represented at General Meetings, under the terms and conditions provided by law and the articles of association.\n- 2.

In the event of planned disposal, the transferor must notify the company by extra-judicial document or registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, indicating the first name, surname and domicile of the transferee, or the company's name and registered office in the case of a company, the number of shares which it is planned to dispose of and the price offered.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  must  inform  the  transferor  within  three months whether it accepts or refuses the planned disposal. Failing notification within three months, it shall be deemed to have accepted.\n\nThe decision to accept must be taken by a majority of votes of the directors present or represented, with the transferor, if he/she is a director, abstaining from the vote. In accordance with the law and these articles of association, at least half of the directors in office must be present.\n\nNo reasons need be given for the decision and it will not give rise to any form of claim in the event of a refusal.\n\nThe transferor must be informed by registered letter within ten days of the decision. In the event of a refusal, the transferor shall have eight days in which to inform the Board whether or not he/she intends to abandon the disposal.\n\nII - 2. If the transferor decides not to abandon the disposal, the Board of Directors must have the shares acquired by shareholders or third parties, or by the company in order to reduce the capital, within three months from the notification of refusal.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall inform the shareholders of the planned disposal by registered letter asking them to state the number of shares they wish to acquire.\n\nThe shareholders must send their offers of purchase to the Board of Directors by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt within fifteen days of receiving the notification.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall allocate the shares offered between the shareholders in proportion to their shareholding and up to the amount of their offers.

If no purchase offers are sent to the Board of Directors within the above-mentioned deadline, or if the offers do not cover all the shares offered, the Board of Directors can have the available shares purchased by a third party, with the Board of Directors responsible for ensuring that said third party is subject to the approval procedure specified in these articles of association.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The shares may also be purchased by the company.\n\nIn  this  case,  the  Board  shall  convene  an  Extraordinary  General Meeting of Shareholders to approve the repurchase of shares by the  company  and  the  corresponding  reduction  in  share  capital. This notice of meeting notice must be sent out sufficiently early to respect the three-month deadline indicated below.\n\nThe share price is set as indicated below, in all the above cases of purchase or repurchase.\n\nII - 5. If all the shares have not been purchased or repurchased within the three-month deadline following the notification of refusal to authorise the disposal, the transferor may sell the shares which he/she is authorised to sell to the original transferee, subject to any partial offers made as set out above.\n\nThis  three-month  deadline  can  be  extended  by  a  summary judgement of the Presiding Judge of the Commercial Court with the transferor and transferee duly called as parties. This order is not open to appeal.\n\nII - 6. In the event that the shares offered are acquired by shareholders or by third parties, the Board of Directors shall notify the transferor of the first name, surname and domicile of the purchaser(s).\n\nThe sale price for the shares and the terms under which the sale of said shares is completed are set at the price offered by the transferee whose offer was refused in accordance with the approval application received by the company. If no agreement is reached on the price, the price is determined by an expert, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1843-4 of the French Civil Code.\n\nThe costs of the valuation are divided equally between the transferor and the purchaser(s).\n\nThe company shall send the transferor or unapproved subscriber the documentation required to register the transfer of shares and their registration in the name of the purchasers appointed by the Board of Directors, by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  parties  concerned  fail  to  return  this documentation to the company within 15  days of sending it, the transfer of shares into the name of the beneficiaries designated by the Board of Directors shall be automatically approved by the signature of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a Chief Executive Officer and by the beneficiary, where appropriate. The shareholder's signature is not required. The shareholder shall be advised within eight days of the registration of the shares in the purchaser's name, and asked to go to the registered office to receive payment, on which interest does not accrue.\n\nIf the shareholder has not withdrawn the payment to which he/she is entitled within six months, the company is entitled to transfer the sum to the Caisse des D\u00e9 p\u00f4 ts et Consignations, after which it is validly discharged of liability in this respect.\n\nII - 7. The provisions of this article apply to all disposals, either inter vivos or by inheritance, liquidation of a matrimonial estate, either free of charge or for valuable consideration, including in cases of disposal by public auction pursuant to a court ruling. These provisions shall also apply in cases of capital contributions, partial contributions of assets, mergers or split-ups.\n\nII - 8. In the case of a capital increase in cash, the Board of Directors may, in order to facilitate the transactions, decide that its right of approval shall not apply to the transfer of subscription rights, but to the issuance of new shares to the non-shareholding subscriber.\n\nThe  non-shareholding  subscriber  is  not  required  to  lodge  an application for approval, because this is implicit in the company's receipt  of  the  subscription  form.  However,  the  subscriber  must, where applicable, enclose any supporting documentation for the acquisition of subscription rights, with the form.\n\nThe time frame prescribed by law and by the articles of association for the Board of Directors to exercise its right of approval shall run from the date of final completion of the capital increase.\n\nWhen  approval  is  refused,  the  new  shares  subscribed  by  the unapproved third party must be repurchased under the above terms and conditions and time frame, at a price equal to the value of the new shares which are the subject of the repurchase, set at the issue price or, failing agreement on the price, by an expert under the terms and conditions provided by law.\n\nII - 9. If the shares in this company are allocated following the partition of a third-party company holding the shares in its portfolio, allocations  to  persons  who  are  not  shareholders  requires  the approval set out in this article.\n\nThe plan to allocate shares to non-shareholders must therefore be submitted for approval by the company's liquidator under the terms and conditions set out in this article.\n\nIf the Board of Directors fails to notify the liquidator within three months of the approval application, the approval shall be deemed to have been given.\n\nIf the allottees or some of them are refused approval, the liquidator can change the allocations made in order to submit only approved allottees, within 30 days of the notification of refusal.\n\nIf no allottees are approved, or the liquidator has not changed the planned partition within the deadline stated above, the shares allocated  to  unapproved  shareholders  must  be  purchased  or repurchased from the company in liquidation under the terms and conditions set out above.\n\nFailing  the  purchase  or  repurchase  of  all  the  shares  for  which approval has been refused within the deadline stipulated above, the partition may be completed in accordance with the plan presented.\n\n## Article 11 - Board of Directors\n\nThe company is managed by a Board of Directors which has at least three members and at most eighteen members, subject to the statutory exemptions.\n\nThe age limit for directors is 65. When a director reaches the age of 65, he/she shall be deemed to have resigned at the end of the next Ordinary General Meeting.\n\nDuring the existence of the company, directors are appointed or reappointed by the Ordinary General Meeting. However, they may be appointed by an Extraordinary General Meeting, in the event of a merger or split-up.\n\nWhere one or more directorships fall vacant between two General Meetings as a result of death, removal or resignation, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more directors temporarily under the terms and conditions provided by law.\n\nDirectors may be removed at any time by the Ordinary General Meeting.\n\nTheir term of office is a maximum of three years, renewable.",
