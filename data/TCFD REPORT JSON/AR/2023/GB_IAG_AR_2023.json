This is important for IAG's performance but also has a positive impact on the economies in which we operate. Aviation boosts economies, supports jobs and develops supply chains globally. This year, we commissioned a study with consultants PwC which analysed IAG's economic impact across the EU and UK for the first time. It took 2019 as the reference period, the last full year of flying before the pandemic. PwC found that IAG supports more than 600,000 jobs in the region directly and indirectly and through the spending of travellers, contributing nearly \u20ac70 billion of GDP to the EU and UK.\n\n## Reaffirming our strategy\n\nIn November, we welcomed investors, shareholders and advisers to our first Capital Markets Day since 2019. This was an opportunity to reiterate the strength of the Group model and to update on our strategic priorities: strengthening IAG's leading positions in some of the world's most valuable aviation markets and our portfolio of world-class brands; enabling IAG Loyalty to reach its full potential; further developing our best-in-class strategic partnerships portfolio and ensuring a financially stable and sustainable business.\n\nThis will be underpinned by Group-wide transformation of our businesses\n\n'Reactivating our network has meant more opportunities for people and businesses to connect. Aviation boosts economies, supports jobs and develops supply chains globally.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto drive efficiencies and higher customer satisfaction. Delivering on these priorities will enable IAG to maximise total shareholder returns.\n\nI was pleased that so many of our shareholders, investors, lenders and sell-side analysts took the opportunity to attend and I thank them for their ongoing support.\n\n## Growing sustainably\n\nAs we maintain and grow IAG's positive impact on the global economy, we must also ensure we are growing as sustainably as possible. IAG led the way for aviation when it was the first global airline group to commit to net zero by 2050 and the first European airline group to set the target of 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. We have a roadmap of initiatives to enable us to reach the net zero target including SAF, new fleet and other technologies. We have made significant progress against these ambitions this year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our total investment in SAF is $1.0 billion of which 86% is future commitments 1 .\n\nIn February 2024, we finalised a deal with eSAF company Twelve. This means we have secured one third of the SAF required to meet IAG's 10% SAF by 2030 target.\n\nEqually as important to our future is ensuring we maintain a diverse and experienced leadership team as well as a pipeline of talent at IAG. We set\n\na target of 40% of senior leadership roles to be held by women by 2025; we can report that by the end of 2023, the figure was 36%.\n\n## Our outlook\n\nLooking at the external environment, there are uncertainties in the outlook for the year ahead. Although our industry has so far appeared resilient to the challenging economic environment, 2024 could bring additional headwinds. Geopolitical instability and the closure of foreign airspace is impacting on flight routes and destinations. In addition, we have faced some operational challenges, particularly at London Heathrow and Dublin airports. There is a risk of further disruption caused by air traffic control strikes in France and incidents such as the NATS outage in August in the UK.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, we are confident that we will deliver both IAG's medium- and long-term financial ambitions. We have the ambition and the capability to do it, thanks to our people who are the ones driving our performance and transformation. Their support gives us confidence that we will deliver on our commitment to sustainable growth and returns for shareholders, while continuing to contribute to countries, communities and economies.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Based on an assumed jet fuel price of $800 per metric tonne and contractual commitments for SAF production.",

In 2023, our airlines flew more than 115 million passengers to more than 250 destinations and transported valuable cargo across our network. IAG delivered strong profits and returns on invested capital last year, with all businesses within the Group performing well.\n\nThese achievements have only been possible because of the dedication of our people in all IAG businesses, and I would like to thank them all for the commitment they have shown.\n\n## Strong financial performance\n\nIn 2023, IAG delivered an operating profit before exceptional items of \u20ac3,507 million, an improvement of \u20ac2,260 million versus 2022. This allowed us to significantly strengthen our balance sheet, reducing gross debt by \u20ac3.9 billion by the end of the year. The Group also regained its S&P investment-grade credit rating, which is another important milestone in its financial recovery.",

        "page_content": "This improved financial position has enabled us to invest on behalf of our customers into our brands including products, services and IT, as well as adding 32 new fuel-efficient aircraft to the fleet. Our airlines continued to recover with capacity in the fourth quarter at 98.6% of 2019 levels across the Group. Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling operated higher levels of capacity than 2019, with British Airways 9.9% lower than in 2019, due to the later reopening of Asia Pacific routes, with further recovery expected in 2024.\n\n## Our strategy for delivering worldclass margins\n\nThis performance demonstrates that our strategy is working. In November, we gathered investors, shareholders, sell-side analysts, lenders and advisers to talk about the future of the Group, in our first Capital Markets Day since 2019. We shared our strategic imperatives going forward. Firstly, we will strengthen our core, driving value from the leadership positions of our airlines in our core markets of the US, Latin America and domestic Spain, and from our world-class brands. Secondly, we will drive earnings growth through assetlight businesses, enabling IAG Loyalty to reach its full potential within the Group and leveraging our strategic airline partnerships. Thirdly, we will ensure that IAG is a sustainable business for the long term, with disciplined capital allocation, a robust balance sheet and delivery of our net zero target by 2050, enabled by IAG's proven structure and business model. All of this will be underpinned by a focus on delivering Group-wide transformation, driving efficiencies and innovation.\n\n## Strengthening our core\n\nWe will continue to develop our leadership positions and hubs. IAG operates in some of the world's largest and most attractive aviation markets. The total market to and from Europe is worth around \u20ac180 billion per annum in revenue. The Group's passenger traffic is in the largest and most attractive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmarkets from Europe, 31% on routes to North America and 19% on routes to Latin America and the Caribbean. A little over a third of this traffic is concentrated in the European short-haul market, with the remaining 15% in the largest pointto-point markets in the rest of the world. The size and position of our hubs Barcelona, Dublin, London and Madrid - on the western side of Europe give us a major competitive advantage.\n\nRegarding the Air Europa transaction, we are working on a very ambitious remedy package that we believe will be able to fully address the European Commission's concerns. We remain committed to closing this transaction as quickly as possible in 2024 to start delivering the deal's benefits for consumers and the wider Spanish economy, while increasing Madrid's competitiveness with other European hubs.\n\nOur brand portfolio is well-positioned across a range of customer segments from cost-conscious to premium travellers, leisure and business passengers, and both short and longhaul routes. All airlines have invested in customer experience in 2023, including in cabin interiors, lounge upgrades, digital capability and service. IAG airlines will invest approximately \u20ac2.5 billion in customer initiatives, including IT, from 2024 to 2026, a two-fold increase compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic average.\n\n## Driving earnings growth through asset-light businesses\n\nIn addition to strengthening our airlines' leadership positions, we will drive earnings through our capital-light businesses, in particular IAG Loyalty. We will focus on developing IAG Loyalty so it can reach its full potential within the Group. Our loyalty programme offers high operating margins, capital-light growth and sustainable cash flows with a less seasonal earnings profile than airlines. IAG Loyalty has become an increasingly attractive part of the IAG portfolio, generating external revenue of over \u00a31 billion and profit growth of 10% per annum. With over 8.2 million active members, IAG Loyalty provides the opportunity to gain greater insights into customer needs and behaviours, in order to drive greater loyalty for our airline brands. It attracted a record number of new customers in 2023 and created new opportunities for customers to collect and redeem Avios. A new partnership with Qatar Airways also saw its Privilege Club adopt Avios as its reward currency, and Finnair will also do this from 2024. IAG Loyalty continues to enhance its business with new initiatives including the first Avios-only flights.\n\nAs a Group we will also focus on developing and leveraging our portfolio of strategic airline partnerships, which drive further asset-light growth for the Group and value to our airlines and customers. Joint Businesses play a key role in this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We are looking for new technologies to help us elevate our customer experience and operations, such as digitised services for friction-free travel and new product offerings.'",

The Group expanded its Joint Business with Qatar Airways too, the largest in the world by number of countries, with the addition of Iberia and launch of the Madrid-Doha route.\n\n## Operating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework\n\nWe always said that our unique business model would deliver resilience in the case of a downturn, and that was proven during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, we have improved the financial foundations of IAG which is evident in our full year results. In 2024, we will ensure that our balance sheet stays strong and that we are disciplined with our capital allocation. IAG is committed to delivering world-class operating margins and returns, and in November we announced our medium-term ambition to deliver 12-15% operating margins and 13-16% returns on invested capital. At the same time, we will retain the focus on building resilience into our operations. We will do this by making targeted investments, particularly in IT as well as by driving efficiencies. We will also continue to invest in sustainability.\n\n## Sustainability remains a top priority\n\nIAG has always been a leader on the path to net zero, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) by 2030. We have a clear pathway to achieving these targets which includes more efficient aircraft, SAF and carbon removals.\n\nOur Group keeps working with producers to secure our airlines' SAF needs as soon as possible. An example of this is our collaboration with Nova Pangaea. We are investing in and working closely with the business, which is building the UK's first waste-to-SAF facility in Teesside. Also, we are looking forward to taking sustainable fuel directly from LanzaJet in the US, the world's first alcohol-to-jet production facility, which opened in 2024. In the UK and Spain, we participate in initiatives such as Jet Zero Council and Alianza para la Sostenibilidad del Transporte A\u00e9reo which aim to develop a SAF industry in both countries.\n\nWe are doing all we can to achieve our targets, but we need all stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem to work together to enable the low-carbon transition. In particular, the industry urgently requires EU and UK policies to incentivise the production of SAF in Europe.\n\n## Underpinned by Group transformation\n\nOur performance in all areas of the strategy is supported by our Group-wide transformation programme.\n\nTransformation is embedded in every business in IAG. By transformation we mean fundamental change that drives results. We are looking at all areas of our businesses in forensic detail, particularly everything that impacts the customer experience.\n\nBritish Airways has a significant focus on transformation with 600 individual projects designed to enhance the customer experience and increase operational resilience and efficiency, with a particular focus on 'on-time performance'. The airline is investing a significant amount in transforming its IT and commercial platforms, in its customer proposition and in its operations, particularly at London Heathrow.\n\nBoth Iberia and Vueling have been recognised among Europe's most punctual airlines and they provide examples to peers in the Group of how they have transformed operations and harnessed technology to improve 'on-time performance'. Vueling is focusing on enhancing its digital offer, and Iberia on updating its long-haul economy and premium economy cabins on its Airbus A350 fleet, to further improve customer experience.\n\nWe are also actively exploring the new wave of technology available to the Group through the development of artificial intelligence, harnessing the specialist skills of teams in IAG Tech, which the whole Group can benefit from.\n\n## People powering transformation\n\nThis Group-wide transformation programme is driven by our people, motivated by our purpose. We hold innovation, commitment, care for people, responsibility, pragmatism, execution, ambition and resilience as key values that enable us to fulfil our purpose.\n\nOur front-line people are the ones that deliver the differentiated customer service that is critical to the success of businesses.\n\nDuring the year, IAG businesses have hired over 13,000 people, which means we are now back to the size of our organisation in 2019. The volume and quality of applications we have received continues to show the strength of not only our brands, but the career opportunities that aviation has to offer. We are pleased that in 2023, IAG airlines were able to sign multi-year pay agreements with almost all their union groups.\n\nsome of the best opportunities available for aspiring pilots, as these schemes include covering the significant cost of training for those who cannot afford it. These initiatives not only provide opportunity for those from lower-income backgrounds, but also allow us to ensure we are well resourced for pilots, going into the future.\n\nIAG also made progress towards increasing the number of women in senior leadership positions, and we are on track to meet our target of 40% of senior leadership roles to be held by women by 2025.\n\nOur Group model allows us to offer senior leaders a unique chance for progression across different businesses. The CEOs of our airlines have all come from other leadership positions within the Group.\n\n## The challenges ahead\n\nWe know the year ahead could be challenging for aviation. The world is facing geopolitical conflict, macroeconomic uncertainty, and of course 2024 will be a significant year politically with millions of people going to the polls, including in the UK and US as well as elections for the European Parliament.\n\nDuring 2023 we have faced persistent issues with air traffic control strikes as well as the NATS outage in August which led to the cancellation of around a quarter of flights from all UK airports in a single day, affecting roughly 250,000 customers, across all of the aviation sector. In 2024, we anticipate ongoing challenges from air traffic control strikes and restrictions which could cause delays and disruption across Europe.\n\n## In conclusion, our strategy gives us confidence\n\nDespite the potential for further headwinds, we are confident that our strategy will ensure that IAG continues to transform and develop in 2024. In fact, the challenges ahead inspire us to accelerate on our strategy. This is all underpinned by embedding a culture of transformation which encourages efficiency and innovative thinking. Transformation for IAG is about fundamental, structural change across all our operations delivering a measurable impact. These outcomes will improve the way we work and enable us to keep delivering for our people, customers, shareholders and in sustainability.\n\n## Luis Gallego\n\nIAG Chief Executive Officer\n\nTraining schemes like British Airways' Speedbird Academy, the third edition of Iberia's Cadet Programme, and the Aer Lingus Future Pilot Programme are",

The event also gave attendees a chance to meet our management team in person, who then set out how we will transform the organisation to deliver sustainable growth and world-class operating margins and maximise total shareholder returns. A wide range of managers from across the Group were also present to give more depth and insight for attendees on an informal basis during breaks from the presentations.\n\nIAG CEO Luis Gallego opened the event with a presentation of IAG's investment case, which summarised IAG's strategy. In particular this will focus on three key strategic imperatives: strengthening our core, driving earnings growth through asset-light businesses and operating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework, all underpinned by Group-wide transformation.\n\nIAG's Management Committee also presented the Group's plans for the medium term from 2024 to 2026.\n\n## Maximising total shareholder returns\n\nThe strategy will enable IAG to deliver world-class operating margins and returns on invested capital. The Group has a high-quality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, while transformation plans will result in further revenue enhancements and cost efficiencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis will help deliver the financial targets that we have set ourselves:\n\n- \u00b7  operating profit margins of 12%-15%\n- \u00b7  return on invested capital of 13%-16%\n- \u00b7  accretive ASK growth of 4%-5% between 2024 and 2026\n- \u00b7  leverage through the cycle of less than 1.8x\n\nThere was a Q&A session after the presentations, in which all members of the Management Committee participated.\n\nThe day included demonstrations of some of the customer products available at British Airways and Iberia, including business cabin seats and food and beverages, as well as proprietary technology showing real-time IAG aircraft movements on the ground and in the air and a simulator from Vueling. Cabin crew from all our airlines were present, hosting our guests.\n\n- 'IAG is transforming its businesses to be more efficient and resilient and to drive sustainable earnings.

Growing our portfolio of global leadership positions\n\nOur brands have experienced sustained strong demand that has driven positive unit revenues across all regions. With a resilient leisure and premium leisure demand environment, Aer Lingus, Iberia, LEVEL Spain and Vueling have managed to grow capacity ahead of 2019 levels, whilst British Airways' recovery remains slower driven by a softer business travel environment after the pandemic and limited capacity to fly east. The Group operating companies have capitalised on the positive demand landscape to grow organically in our core markets. For example, Iberia has focused on increasing capacity on primary cities in Latin America, such as Bogota, Lima and Mexico City, operating the airline's busiest schedule to the region thus far. British Airways also started a new year-round service to Cincinnati and announced the resumption of Abu Dhabi in 2024, whilst Aer Lingus announced the resumption of Minneapolis and the launch of a new direct service to Denver for 2024. Vueling put a special emphasis on de-seasonalisation during the 2023 winter season through increased utilisation, adding more capacity to winter sun destinations, such as the Canary Islands and flying almost 37 million in 2023, a Vueling record.\n\n## 2. Strengthening our portfolio of world-class brands and operations\n\nThroughout 2023, we have continued to improve and transform our brands to be able to provide our customers with an unrivalled proposition and reach the full potential of our businesses in the long term. The Group is embedding transformation across all our business portfolio, looking at all business areas in forensic detail, building on our strong foundations of previous execution to drive a step-change in revenue, costs and operations.\n\nDespite the air traffic control (ATC) challenges in Europe, which have resulted in frequent passenger disruption, our airlines' investments in transformation have delivered enhancements in operational efficiency. For example, Iberia managed to achieve continued global leadership in on-time performance (OTP) by investing in multiple efficiency initiatives, including increasing crew resources and coordination between scheduling and operations, whilst Vueling attained an improvement of more than 4.7 percentage points in OTP, ahead of its transformation targets. British Airways faced punctuality challenges over the year, driven by both internal and external factors, but started seeing gradual improvements from the fourth quarter after the implementation of new initiatives such as the re-shape of London Heathrow Terminal 5 minimum connection times, the optimisation of scheduled block hours and the smoothing of the schedule to even out handling workload.\n\nOur brands also continued to improve the customer experience by investing in enhancing our product across all the journey touchpoints. For example, Iberia rolled out its 'Next' suite-style seat with direct aisle access on its Airbus A350 business cabins and redesigned the catering proposition across cabins on long-haul flights, including an additional meal in economy and premium economy. British Airways implemented numerous customer initiatives, such as trialling biometrics to speed up the boarding process, and continued to fit its new business cabin seat, the Club Suite, onto existing long-haul aircraft.\n\nThe Group also remains committed to invest in the digitalisation of the customer journey to provide our customers with a more personalised and elevated travel experience. During the year, Aer Lingus delivered a significant transformation in its Customer Contact Centre by investing in technology, redesigning its process workflow and implementing bot automation that have brought the average wait time below two minutes and increased customer satisfaction rates by 30% compared with 2022. British Airways initiated the re-platforming of its website and the British Airways app, which allow for deeper personalisation, full online serviceability, end-to-end trip management and a fast product release cycle. Vueling implemented a new social media platform to make case management more efficient and partnered with industry-leading technology organisations to digitalise customer care and disruption management.\n\n## Our priorities for 2024\n\nDuring 2024, the Group will aim to continue strengthening our core markets and hubs where we have a geographical advantage and cultural links, including the US, Latin America and Spain, whilst continuing to explore the potential of future profit pools.\n\nIAG will also continue participating in the industry's consolidation process when value-accretive merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities arise. We aim to complete the Air Europa acquisition by the end of 2024, subject to receipt of regulatory clearance, which will enable the Group to tap into new markets in Latin America and increase global connectivity at the Madrid hub.\n\nOur operating companies will remain focused on delivering the transformation plans for their different business segments and accelerating digital transformation, which will ensure the Group remains well-positioned to continue to create value for our customers and all our stakeholders.",

Growing IAG Loyalty\n\nIn 2023, IAG Loyalty leveraged its positive momentum and continued to contribute greatly to the Group. The strength of the business was reflected in record membership growth surpassing 8.2 million active members with heightened levels of member activity through increased levels of Avios collection and spend.\n\nThis has been achieved through continuous investment in the customer proposition to drive deeper customer engagement and to deliver a strong contribution to the Group. We are continuing to develop our global loyalty currency, Avios. Following the adoption by Qatar Airways in 2022, Finnair was next to announce the adoption of Avios in early 2024, further building Avios' position as a global currency. We successfully leverage our large portfolio of air and non-air partners who provide compelling collection opportunities for our customers in travel, retail or financial services. Our partnerships with American Express, Barclays and Santander continue to provide strong levels of external remuneration and we continue to expand new partnerships with, for example, partnerships launched\n\nwith open-air retailer Bicester Village or World Duty Free. Redemption opportunities, meant to further enhance the utility of Avios for our customers, are also growing with the launch of Avios-only flights, which started in November 2023 with a flight to Sharm El Sheikh and the announcement of several more destinations in 2024. Additionally, this year we transitioned the Group's loyalty programmes to a spend-based earn model to further support member engagement.\n\n## 4. Further developing and leveraging our strategic airline partnerships\n\nDuring 2023, IAG continued to develop and leverage our portfolio of strategic airline partnerships, driving asset-light growth and incremental value. Our joint businesses provide our airlines and partners with the ability to develop a market-leading customer proposition through combined networks, loyalty reciprocity and an overall improved flying experience.\n\nThe Atlantic Joint Business (AJB) between IAG carriers and American Airlines is the leader in the highly attractive Europe-US market. In 2023, Aer Lingus continued advancing its integration in the AJB through codeshare expansion with American Airlines and improved loyalty benefits for customers. The AJB also continued to invest in our customer experience, with British Airways and Iberia now co-locating with American Airlines at JFK Airport in New York whilst offering a new premium check-in area, new lounges and an overall improved network connectivity and experience at the airport.\n\nThe Group continued extracting value from its unique relationship with Qatar Airways. In addition to the joint business, it includes the joint loyalty currency Avios, the interline relationship between the Cargo businesses and leveraging of the combined size of IAG and Qatar Airways for joint procurement of an increasing number of categories. The joint business with Qatar Airways is the world's largest in terms of countries covered. Iberia joined in 2023 and launched a daily flight to Doha from Madrid, adding dozens of new\n\ndestinations for Iberia customers connecting on to Qatar in Doha, a truly asset-light way of increasing Iberia's footprint in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Oceania. We also continue to collaborate strongly on the loyalty side with Qatar Airways. For instance, IAG and Qatar launched a new joint co-brand credit card in India, further enhancing our footprint in the world's most-populous country.\n\nThe reopening of Asia saw British Airways rebuild its network to China and reactivate its joint business with China Southern, whilst the airline restored its network to Tokyo, part of the Siberian Joint Business with our partners Japan Airlines and Finnair.\n\n## Our priorities for 2024\n\nIn 2024, IAG Loyalty will continue to develop its capabilities and invest in its customer experience with the development of single Avios balances and improved member benefits. These will include additional Avios-only flights, enhanced pay-with-Avios capabilities with British Airways and improved redemption for hotels and car hires. We will also support Finnair's adoption of Avios and in parallel explore opportunities with new partners to expand the global reach of Avios.\n\nIn 2024, the Group will continue to strengthen its airline partnerships to maintain our leading customer proposition with best-in-class product and a seamless customer journey. In our AJB we will enhance our joint loyalty proposition with aligned mileage accrual, explore further airport co-location opportunities and increase capacity to popular destinations. With Qatar Airways, our first focus will be to integrate Iberia into the Qatar Joint Business whilst we look for further opportunities to grow our network.",

        "page_content": "Operating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework\n\n## How we create value:\n\nDisciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management\n\n## Industry leader to net zero\n\n## Our activity in 2023\n\nThis year we continued to experience volatility across the global economy. Regular increases in interest rates following record high inflation levels, and supply chain and operations disruptions, all aggravated by the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, have impacted our businesses. Despite this, IAG's companies demonstrated the ability to meet market demand, while carrying out transformation initiatives, resulting in a strong performance across the Group. We managed a robust recovery in our margins and balance sheet, which has allowed us to reinvest in the business, and reduce our debt.\n\n## 5. Disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management\n\nIn 2023, we have achieved a strong operating profit of \u20ac3,507 million for the full year, driven by strong demand and our teams' efforts in revenue and cost transformation initiatives, helping to offset investment and inflation. On the revenue side, we have invested in commercial technology and skills, and upgraded customer journey experiences. On the cost side, we put a special focus into OTP and resilience to minimise disruption in a very challenging operating environment, and end-to-end process re-engineering, among other initiatives.\n\nFollowing the past three challenging years, having a disciplined approach to capital allocation has been especially crucial. Our framework meets the needs of all stakeholders: investors, employees, customers and society; whilst our targets, like maintaining a lower than 1.8x net leverage ratio through the cycle, ensure resilience and access to more favourable funding. This allows IAG to pursue our strategy by investing in the business, our customer experience, digital infrastructure and sustainability targets, whilst growing organically and/or inorganically if value-accretive opportunities exist and returning value to the shareholders.\n\nDuring 2023 we reduced our gross debt position by \u20ac3.9 billion, including the payment of a \u00a32.0 billion (\u20ac2.3 billion) loan to British Airways partially guaranteed by the UKEF, and loans totalling \u20ac1.0 billion to Iberia and Vueling, partially backed by Spain's ICO. Efforts to deleverage and improve operating performance contributed to both IAG and British Airways regaining their investment-grade credit ratings with S&P at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\n## 6. Industry leader to net zero\n\nAlongside a robust financial framework, creating a truly sustainable business is fundamental to our long-term growth. While aviation is essential to our global society, there is no denying that the industry must undergo great efforts to minimise its carbon footprint and fight climate change. IAG has led industry action on sustainability for over a decade, having been the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. SAF is a key solution in our transition plan to net zero and we have committed to a target of 10% SAF use by 2030.\n\nWe are continuously working towards our sustainability targets, having secured c.33% of our total committed SAF to date. This year, we have agreed deals with several SAF producers. An example\n\nis the UK's Nova Pangaea Technologies, a clean-tech company developing advanced biofuels used to produce SAF from non-food agricultural waste and wood residues. IAG will support the building of its first waste-to-fuel commercial-scale production facility, and the UK's first of its kind. Additionally, Microsoft co-funded IAG's purchase of 14,700 tonnes of SAF, the largest co-funded purchase agreement of SAF for emissions reductions globally. Additionally, we continued to engage with cutting-edge technology companies such as ZeroAvia, i6 and Heirloom through our innovation accelerator Hangar 51, to provide multiple decarbonisation solutions.\n\n## Our priorities for 2024\n\nDuring 2024, the Group will keep operating under a disciplined and resilient financial framework whilst investing in our strategy for the years to come and delivering on our sustainability targets.\n\nUsing our financial framework, we plan to continue re-investing in the business, with an expected annual average capital expenditure of c.\u20ac4.5 billion for the next three years. This spending will further improve our product and customer proposition, supporting IAG in advancing with our fuel efficiency targets, and allowing the Group to continue to pursue sustainable growth.\n\nIn terms of our sustainability ambition, we will continue to work with the industry, technology start-ups and government institutions to further accelerate SAF production efforts, and explore new technologies and ways to accelerate the industry decarbonisation process. This includes maintaining our efforts with the UK and EU governments to persuade them to commit and invest in more SAF production.\n\nOverall, IAG is committed to ensure sustainable growth and value creation for all our stakeholders, investing in our customers, people and the broader society while we create long-term value for our shareholders.",

The weighted average age of fleet was marginally lower at 11.0 years compared to 11.3 years in 2022, reflecting the net impact of the ageing of the existing fleet, older aircraft withdrawn from service and new aircraft delivered in 2023.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's operating margin before exceptional items recovered to 11.9% from 5.4% in 2022. Total revenue rose by \u20ac6.4 billion to \u20ac29.5 billion, reflecting a 22.6% increase in capacity versus 2022 together with a load factor 3.5 points higher and yields (per revenue passenger kilometre) 3.8% higher. Cargo revenue was down 28.4% on 2022, driven by lower yields with cargo volumes 17.2% higher. Other revenue was up \u20ac494 million from 2022 reflecting growth of IAG Loyalty and recovery of Iberia's third-party maintenance business. Non-fuel costs were down 4.4% on a unit basis and unit fuel costs were 0.7% higher than 2022.",

The number of dilutive shares fell in 2023, reflecting the full-year impact of the repayment of the IAG \u20ac500 million convertible bond in 2022.

During the year gross debt reduced by \u20ac3.9 billion to \u20ac16.1 billion, driven by the repayment of \u20ac4.0 billion of non-aircraft borrowings partially offset by the net increase of aircraft lease liabilities in the period.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2023, NPS increased by 0.2 points compared to 2022. Positive impacts can be attributed to substantial investment in our cabins and cabin product, the enhancement of food and drink offering, the effort to digitalise the customer journey, and the improvements in customer care. On-time performance (OTP) was negatively impacted by disruptions, stemming from diverse factors such as air traffic control failures, strikes, adverse weather events, supply chain challenges, and baggage issues across key airports.

Customers choose us primarily for our extensive network and schedule and because they trust our brands. We fly to five continents. Through our wide range of partnerships, our customers benefit from an even larger global network covering most countries in the world.\n\n## How we engaged\n\n## Key topics\n\n- \u00b7  Daily 'Customer Voice' survey is sent to customers who have recently flown with us, collecting feedback on their experience\n- \u00b7  Customer feedback through a variety of channels (contact centres, social media, feedback from customer-facing employees) and partners (crews, lounge colleagues and ground handling agents) help us understand key pain points throughout the customers' journeys\n- \u00b7  Brand surveys are done to understand and meet the needs and expectations of our customers\n- \u00b7  Claims and complaints are raised through different channels and monitored to accommodate our customers and enable action where necessary\n- \u00b7  Contact Centre services and other digital channels, for example chat bots on our websites or WhatsApp 24/7, are used so that customers can reach out when needed\n- \u00b7  Communicating information including latest changes in service or product enhancements through various channels, including websites, e-mails and dynamic social media accounts\n- \u00b7  Guidance and a high standard of customer care throughout the customer journey from both airport and on-board colleagues\n\n## British Airways proactive customer care\n\nIn 2023, British Airways launched a customer care initiative to revolutionise our service by proactively addressing our customers' needs. Our dedicated team focuses on identifying opportunities for proactive interventions. Utilising specific channels and innovative practices, we aim to address issues before customers are even aware or before they feel the need to contact us. This proactive approach has started to become standard practice with our team reaching out, seemingly unexpectedly, to resolve impending issues.\n\nOne significant improvement is our ability to support customers while they are in the air, a service we call 'Connected Teams'. This addresses a previous gap in our service and allows us to provide assistance at 35,000 feet.\n\nThis new service has already supported multiple onward passengers who risked missing their connecting flights. Through Connected Teams, cabin crew have been able to request and obtain flight and gate information for tight connections, passing this on to passengers, and helping them get to their new gate as efficiently as possible on landing.\n\nWe are committed to identifying and resolving issues before they impact the customer experience.\n\n- \u00b7  Self-service and self-management capabilities, particularly when there is disruption\n- \u00b7  Punctuality and operational resilience\n- \u00b7  Digitalisation of customer journey\n- \u00b7  Sustainability\n- \u00b7  Expansion of our partnerships\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey metrics\n\nWhy they are important\n\n## NPS\n\n## 18.6\n\n+0.2 pts vly\n\nOther metrics used to track engagement include:\n\n- \u00b7  Customer satisfaction (CSAT) - rates a customer's experience on key touch points in their customer journey\n- \u00b7  NPS and CSAT inform business priorities during the business planning stage, helping to prioritise internal initiatives to drive satisfaction improvements\n- \u00b7  Claims and complaints - a Group consolidated figure provides deeper insights into customer challenges and is used to assess the effectiveness of efforts to address concerns\n- \u00b7  Contact centre key performance indicators help assess the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of customer interactions\n- \u00b7  We aim to provide unrivalled customer propositions and a portfolio of world-class brands targeting specific demand spaces and travel occasions\n- \u00b7  Passenger revenues, including fares and ancillaries, are the most important source of revenue for IAG\n- \u00b7  Delivering outstanding customer experience at all levels of the business and all brands will give us a leading position\n- \u00b7  Recognising our most loyal customers through loyalty programmes, earning rewards on a broad range of items when flying with our airlines and partners, creates value for both IAG and our customers, and builds the relationship",

A chat bot developed using AI and machine learning recognises customer intent with 95% accuracy and is prepared to answer the most frequently asked questions. Usage has grown 300% in the last three years, reaching more than 850,000 sessions in 2023. For some requests, customers prefer human contact, and an experienced pool of agents in the customer centres is ready to engage when required, and ensures a 'fast track' for Business customers or anyone that has suffered a disruption. During 2023 more than 250,000 customers used live chat.\n\nFeedback is key to enhancing our customer experience. IAG's holistic approach uses all available data from various channels to inform product and service strategy decisions. Data is continuously analysed, supplementing it with additional customer research when necessary. 2023 outcomes include those set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Digitalisation of the customer journey to improve ability to self-service. All operating companies invested to digitalise the customer journey. Examples include Iberia's incorporation of GenAI to its WhatsApp and voice bot channels, and smart voice assistance to call centres; British Airways introduced a conversational AI solution to the call centre system; Vueling implemented new digital disruption solutions, e.g. launch of self-management and the deployment of i-coupon; Aer Lingus is investing in digital self-service and disruption management capabilities through a mobile first approach\n- \u00b7  Delivering best-in-class customer care included the formation of a new 'Proactive Customer Care' team in British Airways (see example below), or the second iteration of Iberia's 'Todo empieza conmigo', a programme focused on the delivery of cultural transformation and warm, customer-centric service. Aer Lingus and Vueling are conducting training for cabin crew and other customer-facing employees. Vueling streamlined its refund and compensation process\n- \u00b7  Improved WiFi on long-haul flights through collaboration with providers to launch new satellites and enhance connectivity resulting in a notable improvement in customer satisfaction\n- \u00b7  Food and drink propositions continue to be improved including current offerings and introducing complimentary products\n- \u00b7  In-flight service improvements included upgrading and significantly increasing in-flight entertainment systems content, better quality economy headsets and a new informative video at the start of long-haul flights to clarify the service for that flight. The number of public announcements on early morning / late night flights ('whisper flights') were reduced resulting in improved customer satisfaction\n- \u00b7  Baggage-related processes were improved including customer notifications about baggage arrival or proactive delivery assistance; retrofitting of overhead bins to address customer and crew complaints about the lack of trolley bag space on narrowbody aircraft; enhanced communication of baggage allowances through clearer web and email communication, targeted push notifications, and collaborating with agencies for accurate customer information\n\nThis year, using real-time operational data, Iberia deployed proactive notifications to its most loyal customers with relevant information about their journey. Since the launch this summer, more than 200,000 notifications were sent to customers. Following this strategy, two new customercentric initiatives were introduced:\n\n- \u00b7  WhatsApp Premium, a dedicated channel and 100% human assisted for Top Tier frequent flyers from the IB Plus loyalty programme, and\n- \u00b7  WhatsApp Crew, an agile channel for crew to escalate customer issues and get real-time responses for them, generating a WOW effect while flying with proactive communication for the customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes members of national parliaments, ministers and officials of national governments across multiple departments (including transport, trade, finance, tourism or international affairs), MEPs and other representatives of the institutions of the European Union (including at DG MOVE, and other relevant directorates as well as representatives of individual member states in Brussels). This wide stakeholder body also encompasses civil aviation regulators in the countries in which our airlines are based and the countries of destination. We also engage with competition authorities, including DG-COMP in the EU, the CMA in the UK and, for aviation alliances, the Department of Transportation in the US.\n\n## How we engaged\n\n## Key topics\n\n- \u00b7  IAG's head office Government Affairs team undertakes direct engagement with stakeholders in all the countries in which our airlines are based as well as with EU institutions in Brussels. It coordinates the efforts of the Government Affairs teams of individual operating companies to ensure consistent and coordinated approaches\n- \u00b7  We engage directly with policy, market and regulatory stakeholders on questions of interest to convey IAG positions and contribute technical expertise to discussions. This has included arranging visits to our airlines' bases to enhance understanding of operations and the impacts of policy proposals\n- \u00b7  As well as direct contact, we engage through various international, regional, and local trade associations as well as general business organisations\n- \u00b7  This engagement involves senior executives including the Group Chief Executive, Management Committee members, and senior executives from airline operating companies where appropriate, mainly in the EU, the UK, Spain and Ireland\n- \u00b7  IAG aims to provide a factual basis in support of its policy positions and in 2023 commissioned an extensive study on the Group's economic impacts from PwC and additional research on the benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuels\n- \u00b7  In the field of international air services, IAG representatives joined diplomatic talks wherever possible including those of the EU-US Joint Committee on aviation and ICAO's Air Services Negotiation Event (ICAN) in Saudi Arabia in December to support operating companies' access to market\n\n- \u00b7  Impacts of the war in Ukraine and the Middle East and associated sanctions regimes\n- \u00b7  Sustainability, particularly climate and decarbonisation and all aspects of environmental policy affecting aviation such as availability of and support for investment in SAF and noise impacts\n- \u00b7  Economic impacts of aviation, including tax policy and economic regulation\n- \u00b7  Infrastructure regulation including airspace modernisation, the Single European Sky, airport charges and slot allocation policy\n- \u00b7  Diversity and inclusion for employment as well as development of skills\n- \u00b7  Consumer rights\n- \u00b7  Safety, security and immigration rules\n- \u00b7  International relations including air service agreements and wet leasing, and immigration policy\n\n## Key metrics\n\n## Why they are important\n\n- \u00b7  We use quantitative and qualitative metrics to monitor and adjust our engagement plan. Quantitative metrics include the different types of engagement, range of policies, and seniority of engagement. Qualitative appraisal includes assessment of policy outcomes and tracking the evolution of policy dossiers to ensure that the Government Affairs function is targeted appropriately\n- \u00b7  We monitor quantitative metrics, which for 2023 included:\n- \u00b7  more than 80 contacts held with stakeholders in EU Institutions;\n- \u00b7  meetings with more than 70 Members of the UK Parliament and Peers;\n- \u00b7  five visits organised for policymakers to British Airways and Vueling; and\n- \u00b7  participation in 23 government-togovernment air services negotiations.\n- \u00b7  Government policies and decisions impact many aspects of IAG's business across a wide range of areas including transport, consumer rights, practical operational issues, commercial practices, and the environment. We must comply with relevant regulations but seek to engage responsibly to influence policy developments to benefit our customers and achieve our business goals\n- \u00b7  Engagement with policymakers is essential to understand plans and encourage proportionate outcomes to achieve our vision to be a world-leading airline group on sustainability and ensure we collectively meet our global climate goals\n- \u00b7  Our airlines are subject to regulation by civil aviation regulators in the countries of registration and those of destination, requiring frequent engagement on safety, security, consumer rights and a variety of other policy and administrative issues\n- \u00b7  Regular engagement around the world is needed to manage market access issues under international air services agreements and secure the necessary operating permits",

Changes in political leadership through electoral cycles are anticipated\n- \u00b7  With sector recovery post pandemic, decarbonisation is a predominant area of interest for our stakeholders, requiring engagement with regulators on various aspects of IAG's industry position and commitments in relation to new technology\n- \u00b7  Consumer rights and customer service are of increasing interest to our stakeholders, bringing additional interest in operational performance from stakeholders in the US, EU and UK\n- \u00b7  IAG's airlines regularly engage in discussions with governments and aviation authorities in their relevant markets to respond to and mitigate the risk that states use international air service agreements to promote the interests of their own airlines, given their view that international air services and national carriers are strategic interests\n- \u00b7  Sustainability - From both direct meetings and joint efforts with industry and trade associations on EU climate-related issues, relevant IAG requests were included in the revision and development of different legislation on sustainability, for example:\n- \u00b7  20 million free allowances were allocated for SAF use for 2024-2030 (and could be further extended until 2034); and\n- \u00b7  the recognition of price stabilisation mechanisms (contracts for difference) in view of the ETS Innovation Fund or the inclusion of aviation as part of the EU Taxonomy.\n\nIn the UK, direct engagement and indirect contacts through trade associations were instrumental in securing a legal requirement to consult on the form of a price support mechanism to encourage investment in SAF plants in the UK.\n\nRegular IAG opinion surveys of UK Members of Parliament on reputation and policy showed increasing support for the use of SAF and other innovations, rather than demand management to reach net zero emissions.\n\nRefer to the Sustainability section of this report for more information\n\n- \u00b7  Customer service and resilience - The European commitment to sustainability saw a focus on improving consumer digital access and travel options. Initiatives such as the EU proposal for digital multi-modal services, to provide greater accessibility to other modes of transport, were postponed in line with the sector's request not to force intermediation that could increase ticket prices for European customers\n- Regular engagement with the UK Department for Transport's Resilience team to ensure a proper appreciation of operational disruptions. For example, understanding the impacts of bad weather on operations at congested airports\n- \u00b7  Airport charges - IAG made the case for strong regulation of monopoly providers of airport services so that reasonable levels of charges are set. This engagement contributed to Spain keeping charges flat in 2023. However, due to combination of existing adjustment mechanisms and inflation rates, an increase of 4% is expected for 2024, lower than that initially proposed by AENA. In the UK, the regulatory authorities recognised IAG's and other airlines' arguments and confirmed a downward price path for Heathrow's charges for the remainder of the regulatory period to 2026, and denied an additional \u00a32 billion that Heathrow airport requested that would have been reflected in charges to airlines. Refer to the Regulatory Environment section of the report\n- \u00b7  Market access - IAG supported operating companies to secure the necessary market access through engagement in international negotiations, including British Airways' operating permits for new destinations in the Caribbean or for BA Euroflyer in North Africa, as well as enabling new code-share partnerships, including with Indigo in India\n\n## Proposed revision of EU Slot Regulation\n\nThe existing EU Slot Regulation system enabled the EU to become one of the most connected regions, benefiting EU citizens by providing more travel alternatives and allowing competing business to develop. It allows airlines to plan schedules with predictability, providing the essential stability for network airlines to build efficient hubs. It has also allowed low-cost carriers to build and grow operations, increasing the number of routes that they serve.\n\nIn 2022/2023 the European Commission explored the possibility of a revision of the EU Slot Regulation with the objective of further enhancing the EU slots system and promoting sustainability. One of the aspects under discussion was the 80% rule: if an airline operates 80% of a slot (landing and take-off right) at a given airport in a summer or winter season, it maintains the right to operate the slot again the corresponding next season. This threshold builds in the flexibility airlines depend on to reallocate resources and minimise the impact of unavoidable disruption of passengers. This allows the maximum number of passengers to get to their destination in a timely manner. For example, an airline may take one aircraft from a route where\n\nthere are several daily flights, to replace a grounded aircraft for a destination served by only one daily flight. The revision of this rule in the EU would limit the flexibility to reallocate resources, with a subsequent negative impact for passengers.\n\nThrough engagement, IAG demonstrated that although the objective of an airline was to operate to its planned schedule, in exceptional situations such as technical problems, adverse weather, industrial actions or other unavoidable last-minute disruption, cancellations may be necessary. During the consultation process opened by the European Commission, IAG shared detailed know-how and experience. IAG also organised technical meetings between the senior experts of the airline operating companies and the relevant decision-makers in Brussels and Madrid. IAG also engaged directly with relevant stakeholders at EU Institutions and at a national level in Spain and Ireland. As it is a technically complex topic, we promoted simpler messages through our trade associations to ensure that the negative consequences of the revision of the slots regulation for passengers could be easily understood by non-aviation experts.\n\nAs a result of the inputs from the airline industry, the EU halted its policy plans in this area.",

This result led to strong cash generation in the year, strengthening our balance sheet, with net leverage back within IAG's target range and improved credit ratings, and enabling us to invest in improving our customer experience.\n\n## Delivering world-class operating margins and returns on invested capital\n\nIn 2023, the Group benefited from its high-quality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, with recovery seen in all our businesses and with particular strength in Spain and the North and South Atlantic. Passenger capacity operated across the year was close to the levels operated in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and we were able to generate higher unit revenues than in 2019, which offset higher fuel costs and supplier cost inflation.",

        "page_content": "The result was a strong operating profit before exceptional items of \u20ac3,507 million compared with \u20ac1,247 million in 2022. The shape of the recovery differed across our businesses, with the strongest recovery in Iberia and Vueling, both of which delivered record operating profits, with Aer Lingus and British Airways also seeing a significant improvement on the previous year.\n\nThe recovery has been led by leisure travel across the Group's networks and in all cabins, with the premium leisure segment showing particularly strong performance. Corporate travel also improved versus the previous year, but at a slower rate than anticipated. We continue to grow other revenue streams, including IAG Loyalty, which achieved an operating profit of \u00a3280 million. Our cargo business saw increased volumes in 2023, but also reduced yields, linked to increases in global cargo capacity, the macroeconomic conditions and the reversal of the positive impact on yields of supply chain disruption in 2022. However, its focus on increasing its premium product business contributed to delivering yields above 2019 levels. Fuel costs remained volatile during the year, with the average fuel unit cost similar to 2022, but up over 30% compared with 2019. Non-fuel unit costs improved 4.4% compared with the previous year, with our ongoing transformation programme partially offsetting the impact of inflation; we also made some additional investment in the airlines' operations, IT and the customer experience.\n\n## Disciplined approach to capital allocation to support sustainable growth and margins\n\nThe Group's financial performance and cash generation in 2023 allowed us to deliver a strengthened balance sheet, with positive free cash flow of \u20ac1,320 million enabling a reduction in leverage, which is now at 1.7 times net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items, back within our target maximum of 1.8 times. Both S&P and Moody's increased their credit ratings of the Group, with S&P returning IAG to investment grade. British Airways' separate credit ratings were also upgraded, with British Airways' rating now at investment grade with S&P and Fitch.\n\nWith our strong cash generation, we took the opportunity to rebalance our mix of gross debt and cash and in the second half of the year we repaid \u20ac3,271 million of non-aircraft debt in British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus. These loans, raised due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, had floating interest rates, which had risen significantly over the last two years, and hence were amongst the most expensive of the Group's debt; following the early repayment of this debt the Group will benefit from a reduced interest expense in future years.\n\nAt a Group level we also repaid a \u20ac500 million bond on maturity and did not seek refinancing. These actions have resulted in a reduction in gross debt of \u20ac3,902 million in 2023. We retain strong liquidity, with total liquidity at 31 December 2023 of \u20ac11,624 million, including cash of \u20ac6,837 million and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \u20ac4,787 million.\n\nOur free cash flow of \u20ac1,320 million was after capital expenditure of \u20ac3,544 million. We continue to invest in our strategy and are rebuilding capacity with a more modern, fuelefficient fleet. We also invested in our infrastructure, customer experience and sustainability. In addition to organic growth, we are also pursuing inorganic growth opportunities where they offer a good strategic fit. In February 2023, we agreed with Globalia the acquisition of the remaining 80% of equity in Air Europa, subject to regulatory approval in 2024.\n\nIt is pleasing to finish 2023 having achieved the objective we set down in these pages in last year's report: to return the Group to historical levels of profit and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. We are aware of the uncertainties we face as we enter 2024, including geopolitical events outside of our control. We will continue to strengthen our balance sheet, transform our businesses and apply discipline to how and where we allocate capital, in order to fulfil our objective to deliver sustainable shareholder returns.\n\n## Nicholas Cadbury\n\nChief Financial Officer",

For the year, capacity operated was 95.7% of 2019 levels and capacity was almost fully restored to 2019 levels by the end of the year, reaching 98.6% of 2019 levels in the final quarter.\n\n## Capacity operated by region\n\n| Year to 31  December 2023            | ASKs  higher/ (lower)  v2022   | ASKs higher/ (lower) v2019   |   Passenger  load factor  (%) | Higher/ (lower) v2022   | Higher/ (lower) v2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Domestic                             | 7.8  %                         | 8.4  %                       |                          89.5 | 4.0pts                  | 2.3pts                  |\n| Europe                               | 15.4  %                        | (3.1) %                      |                          85.9 | 4.4pts                  | 2.3pts                  |\n| North  America                       | 23.0  %                        | 3.2  %                       |                          82.9 | 3.6pts                  | (1.2)pts                |\n| Latin America  and  Caribbean        | 18.8  %                        | (1.7) %                      |                          87.6 | 2.5pts                  | 1.2pts                  |\n| Africa, Middle  East and  South Asia | 32.2  %                        | 1.1  %                       |                          83.3 | 2.2pts                  | 0.3pts                  |\n| Asia Pacific                         |                                | 258.0 %  (59.7) %            |                          88.4 | 4.4pts                  | 2.6pts                  |\n| Total network                        | 22.6 %                         | (4.3) %                      |                          85.3 | 3.5pts                  | 0.7pts                  |\n\nWhilst capacity was fully restored to most of IAG's markets, the recovery in the Asia Pacific region was slower, linked to later easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the region.\n\n## Capacity operated by airline\n\n| Year to 31  December 2023   | ASKs  higher/ (lower)  v2022   | ASKs higher/ (lower) v2019   |   Passenger  load factor  (%) | Higher/ (lower) v2022   | Higher/ (lower) v2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Aer Lingus                  | 20.3  %                        | 4.4  %                       |                          80.6 | 3.7pts                  | (1.2)pts                |\n| British  Airways            | 28.1  %                        | (9.9) %                      |                          83.6 | 3.8pts                  | 0.0pts                  |\n| Iberia                      | 18.5  %                        | 3.2  %                       |                          87.2 | 3.0pts                  | 0.0pts                  |\n| LEVEL                       |                                | 33.1  %  (32.8) %            |                          93.4 | 3.7pts                  | 9.5pts                  |\n| Vueling                     | 10.5  %                        | 8.5  %                       |                          91.4 | 4.2pts                  | 4.5pts                  |\n| Group                       | 22.6 %                         | (4.3) %                      |                          85.3 | 3.5pts                  | 0.7pts                  |\n\nIn 2023, British Airways had only restored 90.1% of its total 2019 capacity, as the substantial majority of the Group's capacity to the Asia Pacific region in 2019, for which recovery following COVID-19 has been slower, was operated by British Airways. Capacity for British Airways was also impacted by the accelerated retirement of its Boeing 747-400 fleet during the COVID-19 pandemic and further restoration of capacity is planned for British Airways in 2024 and 2025. The reduction in LEVEL versus 2019 relates to the discontinuation of operations from Paris Orly in 2020, with the capacity of LEVEL's operation in Barcelona up 32.4% versus 2019.\n\n## Domestic and Europe\n\nCapacity and passenger numbers in IAG's Domestic markets, which are predominantly within mainland Spain and to the Canary and Balearic Islands, increased in line with strong leisure demand, with capacity 7.8% higher than 2022, and with a higher passenger load factor of 89.5%, which was up 4.0 points versus the previous year. Capacity and the passenger load factor were also higher than in 2019, up 8.4% and 2.3 points respectively.\n\nThe Group's capacity in Europe was 15.4% higher than in 2022, also boosted by the demand for leisure travel. Aer Lingus began services to Brindisi, Kos and Olbia. British Airways expanded the flying undertaken by its subsidiary launched at London Gatwick airport in 2022, BA Euroflyer, with new routes including Corfu, Mykonos, Innsbruck, and Fuerteventura. Vueling's new routes include a service from Barcelona to Rovaniemi (Finland) and the airline added an extra aircraft at its Bilbao base, with six new routes launched. Passenger load factor for the region was up 4.4 points versus 2022 to 85.9% and was up 2.3 points versus 2019.\n\n## North America\n\nThe Group's airlines launched new routes and increased services to North America, one of the Group's core profit pools, with capacity 23.0% higher than in 2022 and 3.2% higher than in 2019. Aer Lingus started flights to Cleveland and resumed its route to Hartford, Connecticut, together with additional frequencies to Los Angeles, Seattle, Orlando, and Washington DC. The airline will resume its service to Minneapolis and launch a new route to Denver in 2024. British Airways launched services from London Heathrow to Cincinnati and from London Gatwick to Vancouver, a destination already served from its London Heathrow hub. The airline plans further increases in 2024, including doubling its services to San Diego in the summer. Iberia increased its recently-launched routes to Dallas and Washington to yearround services. LEVEL increased its capacity to North America by 23.8% in 2023 and in 2024 will increase further, with a new route from Barcelona to Miami and significant capacity increases to Boston, Los Angeles and New York, JFK. Passenger load factor for the region was up 3.6 points versus 2022 to 82.9% and was down 1.2 points versus 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR)\n\nIAG's other core international profit pool is the Latin America and Caribbean region, including Iberia's network of 20 daily flights to the region and British Airways flights to the Caribbean. British Airways launched flights from London Gatwick to Aruba and Guyana. Iberia increased its capacity to primary cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Mexico City, Montevideo and Quito. LEVEL increased its route to Santiago de Chile to operate as a yearround service, with LEVEL's capacity to the region up 45.4% versus 2022. IAG's capacity in LACAR grew 18.8% versus 2022, although was still down 1.7% on 2019, linked to the retirement of aircraft following the COVID-19 pandemic, with further long-haul aircraft due for delivery in 2024. Passenger load factor for the region at 87.6% increased 2.5 points versus 2022 and was up 1.2 points versus 2019.\n\n## Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)\n\nCapacity to this region was up 32.2% on 2022 and up by 1.1% versus 2019. BA Euroflyer launched a service from London Gatwick to Sharm El Sheikh. British Airways began flights from London Gatwick to Accra and the airline will resume flights to Abu Dhabi in 2024. Iberia started services to Cairo and launched a new route to Doha, which will serve to develop its network with partner Qatar Airways. Vueling's new routes from Barcelona included Luxor and Sharm El Sheikh. Passenger load factor for the region was up 2.2 points versus 2022 to 83.3% and was up 0.3 points versus 2019.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nDuring 2023, the Asia Pacific continued to be the least recovered region from COVID-19, as restrictions linked to the pandemic were lifted later than in other markets and industry recovery has been slower. British Airways services to Shanghai and Beijing resumed in the summer 2023 travel season and during the year the airline increased frequencies to Hong Kong and Tokyo Haneda. Iberia will re-open its route to Tokyo in October 2024. The increases during 2023 led to capacity 258.0% higher than 2022 but still 59.7% lower than 2019, with the passenger load factor for the region up 4.4 points versus 2022 to 88.4% and up 2.6 points versus 2019.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nIn its assessment of going concern over the period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of this report (the 'going concern period'), the Group has prepared extensive modelling, including considering a severe but plausible downside scenario. Having reviewed these scenarios and sensitivities, and the Group's aircraft financing requirements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence over the going concern period, and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Group was able to substantially restore its capacity compared with 2019 and saw recovery in all its businesses, with particular strength in Spain and the North and South Atlantic. Fuel costs were substantially higher than in 2019 and the Group also faced higher supplier cost inflation. The Group was able to successfully offset both of these challenges through its highquality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, and through continued transformation of its businesses. The net result was an Operating profit for the year of \u20ac3,507 million, versus an Operating profit of \u20ac1,278 million in 2022. The Profit after tax for the year was \u20ac2,655 million, versus a profit of \u20ac431 million in 2022.\n\n## Profit for the year\n\n| Statutory results \u20ac million   | 2023   | 2022 1   | Higher/ (lower)  vly   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|----------|------------------------|\n| Operating profit              | 3,507  |          | 1,278    2,229         |\n| Profit before tax             | 3,056  | 415      | 2,641                  |\n| Profit after tax              | 2,655  |          | 431    2,224           |",

The Profit after tax and before exceptional items was \u20ac2,655 million, \u20ac2,253 million higher than the 2022 profit of \u20ac402 million.\n\n| Alternative performance measures (before  exceptional items) \u20ac million   | 2023   | 2022 1   | Higher/  (lower)  vly   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Operating profit                                                         | 3,507  |          | 1,247    2,260          |\n| Profit before tax                                                        | 3,056  |          | 384    2,672            |\n| Profit after tax                                                         | 2,655  |          | 402    2,253            |\n\n## Revenue\n\n| \u20ac million         | 2023   | Higher/ (lower)  vly   | Higher/ (lower)  vly (%)   |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Passenger revenue | 25,810 | 6,352                  | 32.6 %                     |\n| Cargo revenue     | 1,156  |                        | (459)   (28.4) %           |\n| Other revenue     | 2,487  | 494                    | 24.8 %                     |\n| Total revenue     | 29,453 | 6,387                  | 27.7 %                     |\n\nTotal revenue increased \u20ac6,387 million versus 2022, after adverse foreign exchange rate movements of \u20ac490 million, mainly due to the translation of British Airways' and IAG Loyalty's results from pound sterling into euro, which resulted in an adverse variance of \u20ac379 million versus 2022.\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nThe increase in Passenger revenue of \u20ac6,352 million, or 32.6%, was ahead of the increase in passenger capacity of 22.6%, driven by higher yields and higher load factors than in 2022. The growth in Passenger revenue was linked to the reopening of markets, strong leisure demand, together with increases in ticket prices to reflect higher fuel prices and supplier price inflation. The recovery in corporate travel was slower than that of leisure travel, with the Group's premium leisure segment continuing to perform strongly.\n\nThe passenger load factor for the year of 85.3% was 3.5 points higher than in 2022 and 0.7 points higher than in 2019. Passenger yields, measured as passenger revenue per revenue passenger kilometre (RPK) were 3.8% higher than in 2022 and up 19.0% on 2019. The resulting passenger unit revenue (passenger revenue per ASK) for the year was 8.2% higher than in 2022 and 20.1% higher than in 2019.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\nCargo revenue, at \u20ac1,156 million, was 28.4% lower than in 2022. Cargo volumes, measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs), were 17.2% higher than the previous year, as the Group's airlines further restored their operations, leading to an increase in both passenger and cargo capacity. Cargo yields, measured as cargo revenue per cargo tonne kilometre, were 38.9% lower than in 2022, reflecting the substantial growth in global cargo capacity across the industry, together with softer market demand, reflecting the macro-economic conditions. In 2022, cargo yields had benefited from disruption to global supply chains, and disruption to shipping, particularly in the first half of the year. Cargo yields benefited from a growth in premium products, enabled by the opening of a new premium cargo facility at London Heathrow. At Madrid, IAG Cargo's investment in a perishable goods handling facility was completed, further boosting cargo handling capacity.\n\nCargo revenue increased by \u20ac39 million, or 3.5% versus 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a 23.8% increase in cargo yields compared with 2019, which included the impact of transformation initiatives. The higher cargo yields more than compensated for a decline in volumes, which were 16.4% lower than in 2019, mainly due to weaker market demand and reduced cargo capacity, particularly from the Asia Pacific region.",

        "page_content": "## Other revenue\n\nOne of the Group's strategic imperatives is to drive earnings growth through asset-light businesses, with the growth of IAG Loyalty a particular priority. The impact of the growth in IAG Loyalty contributes both to the airlines' Passenger revenue and to Other revenue, through both the issuance and redemption of its loyalty currency, Avios. IAG Loyalty delivered another strong year of growth in the number of members collecting Avios, including through its partnership with American Express. IAG Loyalty's Other revenue was up 61% versus 2022 to \u20ac524 million.\n\nThe largest Other revenue streams for the Group are BA Holidays and Iberia's maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business. BA Holidays grew revenues in line with the continued increase in flying activity and holiday and hotel services revenue increasing by \u20ac133 million to \u20ac938 million. Iberia's MRO business saw increased engine maintenance activity for third-party airlines, with revenues from maintenance and overhaul services up \u20ac155 million to \u20ac683 million. Revenue from ground handling, at \u20ac195 million, was flat versus 2022. After a competitive tender process for ground handling contracts, the final resolution in September 2023 resulted in the loss of third-party handling contracts at eight airports for Iberia and as a result Iberia will see a reduction in ground handling activity and revenues in 2024.\n\nOverall for the year, Other revenue was up 24.8% versus 2022 to \u20ac2,487 million, 29.5% higher than in 2019.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nTotal operating expenditure rose from \u20ac21,788 million in 2022 to \u20ac25,946 million in 2023, linked to the higher volume of flights and passenger numbers and after favourable foreign currency movements of \u20ac408 million, of which \u20ac351 million were due to the translation of the operating costs of British Airways and IAG Loyalty from pound sterling into euros.\n\n## Employee costs\n\n| \u20ac million      | 2023   |   Higher/ (lower)  vly | Higher/ (lower)  vly (%)   |\n|----------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Employee costs | 5,423  |                    776 | 16.7 %                     |\n\nThe rise in Employee costs of \u20ac776 million or 16.7% versus 2022 reflected the continued restoration of the Group's capacity and the related increase in employee numbers, as well as the investment in British Airways' London hub to improve operational performance. Average headcount for the year was 69,762, up 9,962 or 16.7% versus 2022. The Group agreed pay deals with the substantial majority of its bargaining groups and employees during 2023.\n\nOn a unit basis per ASK, Employee costs were down 4.8% versus 2022.\n\n## Jet fuel price trend ($ per metric tonne)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges\n\n| \u20ac million                              | 2023   | Higher/ (lower)  vly   | Higher/ (lower)  vly (%)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Fuel, oil costs and emissions  charges | 7,557  | 1,437                  | 23.5 %                     |\n\nFuel, oil costs and emissions charges were up \u20ac1,437 million versus 2022, principally reflecting increased flying volumes. In 2022, the impact of the significant increase in commodity fuel prices, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of that year, was mitigated by the Group's fuel hedging programme. In 2023, whilst average spot fuel prices linked to fuel purchase contracts were 17% lower than in 2022, the impact of hedging was neutral, with the result that the Group's effective fuel price after hedging was similar to the previous year. Foreign exchange movements accounted for only \u20ac6 million of the increase, with the impact of a weaker US dollar against the euro and pound sterling offset by translation exchange between the pound sterling and euro. Within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges, the cost of complying with emissions trading schemes was \u20ac238 million, up from \u20ac134 million in 2022, reflecting both the higher level of capacity flown, market prices under such schemes, and the reduction in free allowances issued across the EU and UK.\n\nOn a unit basis per ASK, Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges were up 0.7% versus 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Fuel hedging\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging prices in advance. The Group's current fuel hedging policy was approved by the Board in May 2021 (and has been regularly reviewed for appropriateness by the Audit and Compliance Committee subsequently) and is designed to provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The policy allows for differentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each operating company, and the use of call options for a proportion of the hedging undertaken. The policy operates on a two-year rolling basis, with hedging of up to 60% of anticipated requirements in the first 12 months and up to 30% in the following 12 months, and with flexibility for low-cost airlines within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75% in the first 12 months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 months ahead is only undertaken in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Fuel consumption\n\nThe Group continued to benefit from reduced fuel consumption, associated with the investment in new fleet, with 35 newergeneration and more fuel-efficient aircraft entering service in the year. Increased passenger load factors versus 2022 also contributed to reduced carbon intensity, measured as grammes of CO2 per passenger kilometre, which was down 3.6% versus 2022.\n\n## Supplier costs\n\n| \u20ac million                                     | 2023   | Higher/ (lower)  vly   | Higher/ (lower)  vly (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Handling, catering and other  operating costs | 3,849  | 878                    | 29.6 %                     |\n| Landing fees and en-route  charges            | 2,308  | 418                    | 22.1 %                     |\n| Engineering and other aircraft  costs         | 2,509  | 408                    | 19.4 %                     |\n| Property, IT and other costs 1                | 1,058  | 108                    | 11.4  %                    |\n| Selling costs                                 | 1,155  | 235                    | 25.5 %                     |\n| Currency differences                          | 26     | (115)                  | (81.6) %                   |\n| Total Supplier costs                          | 10,905 | 1,932                  | 21.5 %                     |\n\nTotal Supplier costs rose by \u20ac1,932 million, or 21.5% to \u20ac10,905 million, slightly below the increase in capacity. Supplier costs were impacted by continued high levels of inflation and disruption costs, although the impact was partially mitigated by the Group's procurement and transformation initiatives.\n\nSupplier costs include a \u20ac26 million currency differences charge in 2023 versus a \u20ac141 million currency differences charge in the previous year; 2022 had been impacted by a significant strengthening of the US dollar against both the pound sterling and the euro versus 2021. Total foreign currency impacts on Supplier costs, including currency differences, were \u20ac298 million favourable versus 2022, including a favourable impact of \u20ac163 million related to translating British Airways' and IAG Loyalty's supplier costs from pound sterling into euro and the \u20ac141 million favourable currency differences charge outlined above.\n\nOn a unit basis per ASK, Supplier costs were down 1.1% versus 2022.\n\n## Ownership costs\n\nOwnership costs include Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including right of use assets, and the Net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\n| \u20ac million                                          | 2023   | Higher/ (lower)  vly   | Higher/ (lower)  vly (%)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment         | 2,063  | (7)                    | (0.3) %                    |\n| Net gain on sale of property,  plant and equipment | (2)    | 20                     | (90.9) %                   |\n| Ownership costs 1                                  | 2,061  | 13                     | 0.6 %                      |\n\nThe increase in ownership costs versus 2022 is mainly driven by the increase in the Group's fleet of aircraft, linked to the restoration of capacity and 34 deliveries of new aircraft in the year. The Net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment was \u20ac2 million, reflecting the disposal of aircraft withdrawn from service and related spare parts. On a unit basis per ASK, Ownership costs were down 18.2% versus 2022, mainly reflecting the restoration of capacity and improvements in aircraft utilisation.",

        "page_content": "## Aircraft fleet\n\nIn 2023, the in-service fleet increased by 24 aircraft: 37 aircraft entered service and 13 aircraft were retired. Of the aircraft entering service, five re-entered service having previously been stood down and two were delivered in late 2022. In total, 34 aircraft were delivered in the year, of which four aircraft entered service early in 2024.\n\n## Number of fleet\n\n| Number of fleet in-service   |   2023 |   2022 | Higher/ (lower)  vly   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Short-haul                   |    389 |    381 | 2.1  %                 |\n| Long-haul                    |    193 |    177 | 9.0 %                  |\n|                              |    582 |    558 | 4.3 %                  |\n\nIn addition to the in-service fleet, there were a further nine aircraft not in service, made up of five aircraft held by the Group pending disposal or lease return and four aircraft delivered late in 2023 and not in service by 31 December 2023.\n\n## Exchange rate impact\n\nExchange rate impacts are calculated by retranslating current year results at prior year exchange rates. The reported revenues and expenditures are impacted by the translation of currencies other than euro to the Group's reporting currency of euro, primarily pound sterling related to British Airways and IAG Loyalty. From a transaction perspective, the Group's performance is impacted by the fluctuation of exchange rates, primarily exposure to the pound sterling, euro and US dollar. The Group typically generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except the US dollar, for which capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit which is managed and partially hedged. The Group hedges its economic exposure from transacting in foreign currencies but does not hedge the translation impact of reporting in euro.\n\nOverall, in 2023 the Group operating profit before exceptional items was reduced by \u20ac82 million due to adverse exchange rate impacts.\n\n## Exchange rate impact before exceptional items\n\n|                                                   | 2023                | 2023                | 2023                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million Favourable/(adverse)                    | Translation  impact | Transaction  impact | Total  exchange  impact |\n| Total exchange impact  on revenue                 | (379)               | (111)               | (490)                   |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating  expenditures | 351                 | 57                  | 408                     |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating profit        | (28)                | (54)                | (82)                    |\n\n|                                                   | 2022                | 2022                | 2022                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million Favourable/(adverse)                    | Translation  impact | Transaction  impact | Total  exchange  impact |\n| Total exchange impact  on revenue                 | 97                  | 685                 | 782                     |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating  expenditures | (129)               | (975)               | (1,104)                 |\n| Total exchange impact  on operating profit        | (32)                | (290)               | (322)                   |\n\nThe exchange rates of the Group were as follows:\n\n|                                                    | 2023   | 2022   | Higher/  (lower)  vly   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Translation - Balance sheet                        |        |        |                         |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.16   | 1.14   | 1.8  %                  |\n| Translation - Income statement  (weighted average) |        |        |                         |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.15   | 1.17   | (1.7) %                 |\n| Transaction (weighted average)                     |        |        |                         |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.15   | 1.17   | (1.7) %                 |\n| \u20ac to $                                             | 1.09   | 1.05   | 3.8 %                   |\n| \u00a3 to $                                             | 1.26   | 1.23   | 2.4 %                   |",

        "page_content": "## Total net non-operating costs\n\nTotal net non-operating costs for the year were \u20ac451 million, versus \u20ac863 million in 2022. Finance costs of \u20ac1,113 million were \u20ac96 million higher than in 2022, although they fell in the fourth quarter by 16.3% or \u20ac48 million, linked to the early debt repayments described in 'Early repayment of debt raised in 2020 and 2021' below and in note 3 to the Group financial statements. Finance income was up \u20ac334 million, reflecting the Group's strong cash balances and the higher interest rates earned on deposits. The other main movement was for net currency retranslation, with a credit of \u20ac176 million in 2023 versus a charge of \u20ac115 million in 2022, principally reflecting the weakening of the US dollar.\n\nThe Net change in the fair value of financial instruments of \u20ac11 million reflects fair value adjustments at 31 December 2023 of IAG's \u20ac825 million convertible bond maturing in 2028.\n\nOther non-operating credits of \u20ac8 million in 2023 (2022: credit of \u20ac110 million) mainly represent net gains or losses on derivative contracts for which hedge accounting is not applied, together with a net gain of \u20ac10 million in 2023 on the sale of investments.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax charge on the Profit for the year was \u20ac401 million (2022: tax credit of \u20ac16 million), and the effective tax rate was 13.1% (2022: negative 3.9%).\n\nThe substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based: in the UK, Spain and Ireland, which had statutory corporation tax rates of 23.5%, 25.0% and 12.5% respectively for 2023. The expected effective tax rate for the Group is determined by applying the relevant corporation tax rate to the profits or losses of each jurisdiction.\n\nThe geographical distribution of profits and losses in the Group results in the expected tax rate being 23.5% for the year to 31 December 2023. The difference between the actual effective tax rate of 13.1% and the expected tax rate of 23.5% is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses in the Group's Spanish companies.\n\nThe Profit after tax for the year was \u20ac2,655 million (2022: \u20ac431 million).\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25% from April 2023. On 24 May 2021, the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a charge of \u20ac13 million (2022: \u20ac17 million credit) is recorded in the Income statement and a credit of \u20ac3 million (2022: \u20ac10 million charge) is recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group is monitoring the OECD's proposed two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This reform to the international tax system is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises with consolidated worldwide annual turnover exceeding \u20ac750 million will be subject to a minimum 15% effective tax rate, and also proposes to address the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation. On 15 December 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive. On 22 December 2022, the EU Minimum Tax Directive was published.\n\nOn 11 July 2023, the UK enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which introduced the Multinational Top-up Tax and the Domestic Topup Tax with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. These taxes are the UK's adoption of the income inclusion rule and domestic minimum top-up tax rule referenced in the OECD's Pillar Two reform.\n\nOn 18 December 2023, Ireland enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which, pursuant to the EU Minimum Tax Directive, provided for the introduction of a new minimum effective rate of tax for certain businesses. These rules provide for a Qualified Domestic Top-Up Tax where an in-scope group's Irish operations have an effective rate of tax of less than 15%. They come into force for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.\n\nOn 19 December 2023, Spain's Council of Ministers approved a draft law to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This is to be subject to consultation, prior to being sent to Parliament.\n\nFor 2023, the predominant jurisdiction in which the Group operates with an effective tax rate of less than 15% is Ireland through Aer Lingus. While the impact on the Group of the adoption of Pillar Two is not yet reasonably possible to estimate, for indicative purposes, in 2023 Aer Lingus recorded a current tax expense of \u20ac24 million relating to its Irish operations, representing an effective tax rate of 12.8%. Had the effective tax rate applied by Aer Lingus to its Irish operations been 15%, the current period tax expense would have increased by \u20ac4 million to \u20ac28 million, which would have increased the overall Group effective tax rate from 13.1% to 13.3%.\n\nOn 18 January 2024, the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) in Spain issued a ruling that the amendments to corporate income tax arising from the introduction of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional and accordingly revoked. The Group has not adjusted the financial statements for this revocation, but expects to recognise a tax receivable, excluding interest arising, from the Spanish tax authorities of approximately \u20ac191 million and an associated deferred tax charge of approximately \u20ac58 million.",

        "page_content": "## Review by operating company\n\nAll of the airline operating companies saw a significant increase in profitability in 2023, with Iberia and Vueling achieving record levels of operating profit, reflecting strong passenger yields, which were able to offset the impacts of higher effective fuel prices and inflation.\n\nBritish Airways operated the lowest passenger capacity relative to 2019, with ASKs at 90.1% of 2019, partly linked to the delayed restoration of its capacity to the Asia Pacific region, which saw COVID-19 restrictions continue longer than the rest of IAG's markets. Aer Lingus operated at 104.4% of 2019 capacity, including the impact of its new UK base at Manchester Airport opened in October 2021. Iberia and Vueling both increased capacity versus 2019, operating at 103.2% and 108.5% of 2019 levels respectively.\n\n## Operating profit before exceptional items\n\n|                             | 2023   |   2022 1 | 2019 1, 2   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|----------|-------------|\n| Aer Lingus (\u20ac million)      | 225    |       57 | 276         |\n| British Airways (\u00a3 million) | 1,431  |      306 | 1,893       |\n| Iberia (\u20ac million)          | 940    |      389 | 498         |\n| Vueling (\u20ac million)         | 396    |      187 | 241         |\n| IAG Loyalty (\u00a3 million)     | 280    |      240 | 176         |\n\nIAG Loyalty showed significant growth in its non-airline partner revenue streams, together with benefiting from the recovery in the Group's airlines, leading to a second successive year of record operating profits, with operating profit before exceptional items of \u00a3280 million (\u20ac321 million), up from \u00a3240 million (\u20ac282 million) in 2022. IAG Loyalty's operating margin for 2023 was 21.7%, with the reduction of 6.7 points from 28.4% in 2022 due to the increased level of Avios redemption activity as well as the mix of Avios issued between the Group's airlines and other partners.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to invest in its aircraft fleets, customer products and services, IT infrastructure and sustainability, as the business continued to recover and restore capacity. Capital expenditure, measured as the Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from the Cash flow statement, was \u20ac3,544 million, compared with \u20ac3,875 million in 2022, with the reduction of \u20ac331 million due to the profile of fleet deliveries and pre-delivery payments, with investment in IT higher than in 2022, as the Group continues to invest in its IT estate and transformation projects. In 2023, the Group took delivery of 34 aircraft: ten for British Airways, 14 for Iberia, six for Vueling, two for Aer Lingus and two for LEVEL. Of these deliveries, 28 were aircraft acquired from Airbus and Boeing and six were leased directly from aircraft lessors (2022: 25 aircraft acquired from Airbus and Boeing and two leased directly from aircraft lessors). One of the aircraft acquired from Airbus in 2023 was novated to a lessor immediately prior to the point of delivery as part of a sale and leaseback arrangement, which resulted in the final delivery payment for the aircraft being made by the lessor, rather than by the Group as capital expenditure; the Group also received a refund of the pre-delivery payments it had made in advance of the delivery date in respect of that aircraft.\n\n| Aircraft deliveries   |   2023 | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320ceo        |      2 | -      |\n| Airbus A320neo family |     19 | 12     |\n| Airbus A330           |      2 | -      |\n| Airbus A350           |      9 | 12     |\n| Boeing 787-10         |      2 | 3      |\n| Total                 |     34 | 27     |",

        "page_content": "## Aircraft orders\n\n## Working capital\n\nDuring 2023, the Group converted ten A320neo options to firm deliveries in 2028, as replacement aircraft for its short-haul network. A new order was placed for British Airways for six Boeing 787-10 aircraft, and one new Airbus A350-900 aircraft was ordered for Iberia; the aircraft represented by these new orders will be delivered in 2025 and 2026. In addition to these orders from Airbus and Boeing, the Group entered into leases directly with lessors for two Airbus A350-900 aircraft for Iberia, two Airbus A330-200 aircraft for LEVEL and two A320ceo aircraft for Vueling, all of which were delivered during the year. The table below includes three further A320ceo aircraft for Vueling, for which leases were signed prior to 31 December 2023, with the aircraft to be delivered in 2024.\n\nThe Group anticipates introducing eight further A320ceo aircraft for Vueling in 2024 through operating leases, to cover aircraft availability linked to additional maintenance requirements for aircraft with Pratt & Whitney 'GTF' engines.\n\n| Aircraft future deliveries at 31 December   |   2023 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320ceo                              |      3 | -      |\n| Airbus A320neo family                       |     82 | 91     |\n| Airbus A321XLR                              |     14 | 14     |\n| Airbus A350                                 |      3 | 12     |\n| Boeing 737                                  |     50 | 50     |\n| Boeing 777-9                                |     18 | 18     |\n| Boeing 787-10                               |     11 | 7      |\n| Total                                       |    181 | 192    |\n\nIn addition to those committed future deliveries shown above, at 31 December 2023, the Group held options to acquire a further 235 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2023 amounted to \u20ac12,706 million (2022: \u20ac13,749 million), with the decrease attributable to the net of the aircraft deliveries and the new orders described above. Most of these commitments are denominated in US dollars.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe net movement in working capital saw a cash outflow of \u20ac142 million in 2023, compared with a significant cash inflow of \u20ac1,884 million in 2022. The year 2022 had seen a significant restoration of airline capacity by the end of the year, with significant related increases in bookings for future travel (Deferred revenue), net of trade receivables, together with an increase in Trade and other payables, linked to the increase in the Group's flying programmes and the related increase in operating expenditure. By contrast, in 2023, working capital had returned closer to a steady-state position. Inventories increased by \u20ac141 million to \u20ac494 million, partially linked to engine purchases to meet maintenance requirements. Trade receivables were up by \u20ac229 million to \u20ac1,559 million, related to higher passenger numbers and yields, together with some timing differences related to certain receipts due from the Spanish government.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, total Deferred revenue, which includes the Group's loyalty schemes, was \u20ac8,023 million, an increase of \u20ac379 million versus \u20ac7,644 million at 31 December 2022. Deferred revenue at 31 December 2023 includes \u20ac645 million in respect of unredeemed vouchers, including associated taxes (2022: \u20ac911 million). The unredeemed voucher balance includes: flight vouchers issued to customers at their election to provide the flexibility to change their destination and/or date of travel (a policy introduced in 2020 and still in operation) and loyaltyrelated companion vouchers (referred to as 'non-disrupted vouchers'); vouchers issued due to COVID-19 flight cancellations (referred to as 'disrupted vouchers'); certain other flexible fare options; and other gift vouchers. The outstanding balance of disrupted vouchers at 31 December 2023 was \u20ac139 million, with the remaining \u20ac506 million relating to ongoing commercial policies, which the Group expects to continue to be offered in the future.",

In November 2018, S&P and Moody's assigned IAG long-term investment-grade credit ratings with a stable outlook; IAG's credit ratings remained investment-grade up until the outbreak of COVID-19. In 2023, due to the improvement in the Group's profitability, cash generation and balance sheet, both S&P and Moody's raised their credit ratings of IAG in the fourth quarter of the year. The Group's current ratings (at 28 February 2024) are: S&P: BBB- (investment grade), Moody's: Ba1. British Airways has separate credit ratings, which were also increased to BBB- (investment grade) by Fitch and S&P; Moody's rating of British Airways is Ba1.\n\n## Early repayment of debt raised in 2020 and 2021\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the Group's airlines required additional liquidity, due to the significant adverse impact of COVID-19, and all entered into special COVID-19-related financing arrangements, partially or fully guaranteed by the governments in their home countries. This debt was based on floating rate arrangements and agreed at margins that reflected the condition of the financial markets and the Group's airlines at the time; this debt was among the most expensive of the Group's debt to service. As a result of the Group's profitability and cash generation in 2022 and 2023, and expected continued strong cash generation over the foreseeable future, in the second half of 2023, the Board agreed that the remainder of this debt should be repaid ahead of its scheduled maturity, which was between 2024 and 2026. The total amount repaid early was \u20ac3,271 million: \u00a32,000 million (\u20ac2,312 million) for British Airways, partially guaranteed by the UK Export Fund (UKEF); \u20ac644 million and \u20ac223 million for Iberia and Vueling respectively, partially guaranteed by Spain's Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO); \u20ac42 million of other non-aircraft debt for Iberia; and \u20ac50 million to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) for Aer Lingus. These early debt repayments will result in a reduction in interest costs in future years.\n\nFollowing these early repayments, and the repayment of IAG's \u20ac500 million bond in July 2023, the maturity profile of the Group's debt as of 31 December 2023, aside from aircraft financing payments, includes two \u20ac500 million IAG bonds due in 2025 and 2027, respectively, IAG's \u20ac825 million 2028 convertible bond and a \u20ac700 million IAG bond due in 2029.\n\n## Debt and capital\n\nThe Group monitors leverage using net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items, in addition to closely following measures used by the credit ratings agencies, including those based on total borrowings (gross debt).\n\nIn 2019, the Group set a target of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items below 1.8 times, which broadly corresponded to investment grade with the credit ratings agencies. At its Capital Markets Day in November 2023, the Group confirmed this target remains appropriate.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items had reduced to 1.7 times, compared with 3.1 times in 2022, reflecting the strong recovery in profitability and the related cash generation, with capital expenditure \u20ac331 million lower than the previous year.\n\n## Net debt\n\n| \u20ac million                                                        | 2023    | 2022              | Higher /  (lower)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Debt                                                             | 19,984  | 19,610            | 374                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and  interest-bearing deposits         | (9,599) | (7,943)   (1,656) |                     |\n| Net debt at 1 January                                            | 10,385  |                   | 11,667    (1,282)   |\n| Decrease/(increase) in cash net of  exchange                     | 2,762   | (1,656)           | 4,418               |\n| Movements in total borrowings                                    |         |                   |                     |\n| Net cash outflow repayments of  borrowings and lease liabilities | (5,999) |                   | (2,505)  (3,494)    |\n| Net cash inflow new borrowings                                   | 1,001   | 1,436             | (435)               |\n| Non-cash impact of new leases                                    | 1,315   | 1,017             | 298                 |\n| Decrease in net debt from regular  financing                     | (3,683) |                   | (52)   (3,631)      |\n| Exchange and other non-cash  movements                           | (219)   | 426               | (645)               |\n| Net debt at 31 December                                          | 9,245   | 10,385    (1,140) |                     |\n\nNet debt reduced by \u20ac1,140 million, principally due to the recovery in profitability and operating cash flow generation, partially offset by the capital expenditure of \u20ac3,544 million. Gross debt reduced by \u20ac3,902 million during the year to \u20ac16,082 million. Repayments exceeded new borrowings by \u20ac4,998 million, mainly due to the early repayments of non-aircraft debt outlined above, the repayment on maturity of a \u20ac500 million IAG bond, and scheduled repayments of aircraft financing exceeding new aircraft financing raised during the year. The Group also raised financing by way of sale and leaseback transactions and extended existing leases, which together added \u20ac1,315 million to gross debt. The Group's gross debt is subject to foreign exchange translation movements, as the majority of the Group's aircraft debt is denominated in US dollars. Over the course of 2023, the euro and pound sterling strengthened against the US dollar leading to a decrease in gross debt of \u20ac361 million. The remainder of the variance in gross debt versus 2022 is mainly due to the increase in the fair value of IAG's \u20ac825 million convertible bond due in 2028.",

The reduction in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in IAG and other Group companies principally reflects the early repayment of floating rate unsecured debt in all the airlines, and the repayment of the IAG \u20ac500 million 2023 bond on maturity.\n\n## Debt\n\nLong-term aircraft financing was drawn for 31 aircraft during 2023, including five aircraft that were delivered in 2022 to British Airways and for which funding was committed at 31 December 2022. The Group also secured committed funding of \u20ac375 million, to be drawn in 2024, for three British Airways aircraft, including two delivered in 2023; this committed funding is included in committed and undrawn aircraft financing facilities at 31 December 2023. Linked to its strong cash generation, Iberia did not seek financing for three new A321neo aircraft delivered in 2023, with these aircraft held unencumbered at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Equity\n\nNo equity was raised or repaid during the year, nor in 2022.\n\n## Liquidity facilities\n\nDuring the year, the Group exercised a one-year extension to the availability of its Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), which now has committed availability until March 2026. The available amount will remain at $1,755 million (\u20ac1,605 million) until March 2025 and reduce to $1,655 million (\u20ac1,513 million) for the final 12 months to March 2026. The facility was originally agreed and executed with a syndicate of banks in 2021, with availability for three years, plus two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia, each of which has a separate borrower limit within the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and/or take-off and landing rights at London Heathrow or London Gatwick airports. This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group also added a new \u00a31,000 million (\u20ac1,159 million) committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed by the UKEF, which was agreed upon the repayment of British Airways' \u00a32,000 million (\u20ac2,312 million) loan in September 2023 and which matures in September 2028. This is in addition to the existing \u00a31,000 million (\u20ac1,159 million) committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed by the UKEF, which was agreed and executed in 2021 and matures in November 2026. Both facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2023.\n\nAer Lingus has a \u20ac350 million credit facility with Ireland's ISIF, which is available until March 2025. This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2023. At 31 December 2022 \u20ac50 million was drawn; this \u20ac50 million was repaid in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe Group also has certain other committed and undrawn general and overdraft facilities, bringing total committed and undrawn general and overdraft facilities at 31 December 2023 to \u20ac4,412 million (2022: \u20ac3,284 million).\n\nThe Group also holds \u20ac375 million of committed and undrawn aircraft financing facilities (2022: \u20ac1,116 million). The committed amount at 31 December 2023 represents financing for three British Airways aircraft to be drawn in 2024. The committed and undrawn aircraft financing facilities at 31 December 2022 included committed financing for five aircraft for British Airways that was drawn in 2023 and certain backstop financing arrangements, which have now expired. The Group's aircraft deliveries continue to be successfully financed on regular longterm financing arrangements as required, and hence no drawing on these backstop arrangements was necessary.\n\nIn total, the Group had \u20ac4,787 million of committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities as at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac4,400 million).\n\nThe facilities values above do not include the balance of certain shorter-term working capital facilities available to the Group's operating companies.\n\n## Dividends\n\nNo dividends were proposed or paid in 2023 (2022: nil).\n\n## Liquidity and cash flow\n\nTotal liquidity, measured as cash, cash equivalents and interestbearing deposits of \u20ac6,837 million and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \u20ac4,787 million, was \u20ac11,624 million at 31 December 2023. This represented a decrease of \u20ac2,375 million versus total liquidity of \u20ac13,999 million at the end of 2022, linked mainly to the Group's decision to repay certain of its debt raised in 2020 and 2021 in advance of its scheduled maturity.",

As at 31 December 2023, the scheme was over 100% funded on the 2021 valuation basis and an overfunding protection mechanism agreed with the NAPS Trustee had the effect that no contributions were due in 2022 or 2023. Deficit contributions could resume should the funding level fall in the future. The pension cash flows shown above represent payments to various smaller schemes within the Group. The valuation of the main British Airways pension schemes also showed a surplus on the IAS 19 accounting basis, which does not impact contributions due to the schemes. Total Employee benefit assets at 31 December 2023, of which the principal element is the NAPS accounting surplus, were \u20ac1,380 million; the reduction of \u20ac954 million versus 31 December 2022 was predominately due to the impact of the fall in AA corporate bond yields applied in discounting scheme liabilities, leading to higher liabilities at the same time as the market value of assets fell, mainly due to the increase in UK government bond yields.",

Provision and other non-cash movements also include restructuring payments of \u20ac82 million, mainly relating to redundancy programmes in Iberia agreed prior to 2020.\n\nThe increase in interest paid in 2023 reflects higher interest rates, partially mitigated in the fourth quarter by the early repayment of \u20ac3,271 million of floating rate debt outlined above.

        "page_content": "## Engagement for the benefit of our industry\n\n## Engagement context\n\nThe strong recovery in demand for travel during 2023 was accompanied by the usual close scrutiny by regulators and policy-makers with additional challenges created by the geopolitical background. Political dynamics in Spain and forthcoming elections in the UK and for the European Parliament mean that policymakers have tended to focus on shorter-term priorities which is a challenge for an industry with long investment cycles.\n\nWith this overall context, IAG continued to engage with policymakers in the institutions of the European Union and in the countries in which its operating airlines are based or serve, to promote the economic and social benefits of aviation and explain the impacts of policy proposals on our business. We continue to encourage aviation regulators to adopt measured policies that recognise the competitive nature of international aviation (including proposals to amend airport slot allocation rules in the EU or the UK) and to promote a greater balance of the risk and reward in the regulation of monopoly airports and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), given the significant cost to airlines of their services.\n\nIn addition to direct engagement with policymakers, IAG worked through trade associations, notably Airlines 4 Europe (A4E) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), as well as national industry and business associations, to put its case to governments and institutions such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on issues of importance to the Group and its customers, especially in sustainability.\n\n## Geopolitical instability\n\nThe far-reaching impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the world also had immediate practical effects on airlines by preventing European and UK airlines from operating through Russian airspace, a situation which, along with the war, endured throughout 2023. IAG's operating companies adapted by routing aircraft to and from Asia away from Russian airspace with the resultant increase in flying time driving more complex planning and a need for additional crew.\n\nAt various times in 2023, military coups and other conflicts in West Africa and the Sahel region resulted in further temporary restrictions to airspace. Although the risks to smooth operations from such events can usually be managed and are isolated in their geographical impact, they also exacerbate industry-wide challenges.\n\nA further impact of the war in Ukraine was seen in 2023 with the extension of sanctions on Russia by the EU and the UK to prohibit, from the end of September, the import of Russian iron and steel products processed in a third country. The additional requirements to scrutinise the origins of steel and the location of manufacture have slowed procurement of aircraft parts adding to pressure on the global supply chain.\n\n- 'IAG continues to play a leading role in developing industry plans for reaching net zero carbon emissions.'\n\nThe conflict in Israel from 7 October and the subsequent escalation of military action in Israel and Gaza meant that IAG's airlines ceased operations to Israel. There are immediate commercial impacts of being unable to operate to the country and further signs of impact on markets in the immediate conflict area. We continue to monitor the wider economic impacts on the world economy of this and other conflicts.\n\nThe global supply chain has not yet returned to normal from the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, having the practical effect of putting pressure on maintenance and engineering resources affecting fleet availability. Both Airbus and Boeing have seen delivery schedules for new aircraft slip behind their original plan and the distribution of replacement parts continues to take longer than it did in 2019, increasing maintenance times for many airlines. The problems that emerged during the year for airlines operating Airbus aircraft with the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G 'GTF' engines meant significant additional numbers of aircraft in the global airline fleet required additional maintenance at the end of 2023. While the impacts for IAG's own aircraft are limited and manageable, the pressure on maintenance facilities increased during 2023 since other airlines took up capacity to solve this issue and will continue to do so in the coming years. IAG engaged with regulators to explain the potential difficulties for customers that this pressure could cause.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nMuch of IAG's advocacy and engagement in 2023 was concerned with the issue of sustainability. IAG continues to play a leading role in developing industry plans for reaching net zero carbon emissions and the Group's strategic approach and practical actions to reaching our targets are explained in detail in the Sustainability section.",

        "page_content": "In our ongoing activities to explain our position, the Group and its operating airlines continued to engage with representatives of the institutions of the EU and the governments of Spain, Ireland and the UK. We have long advocated the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) which reduces lifecycle CO2 emissions by 80% as the solution, not just to the near-term need to drive down industry emissions, complementing the deployment of more efficient aircraft, but also to enable sustainable long-haul aviation alongside the development of carbon capture technology and future generation e-fuels.\n\nIn Europe, high-level engagement continued on the most relevant of the EU's Fit for 55 policies including the aviation SAF blending mandate (ReFuel EU aviation) and the revision of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive for Aviation. IAG welcomed the EU's commitment of 20 million free SAF allowances to encourage SAF uptake between 2024 and 2030 and the increase to the ETS innovation fund budget to help deploy net zero and innovative technologies. In 2023, aviation was also included in the EU Taxonomy as one of the sectors that has the potential to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation.\n\nWhile the Group continues to support the principles and approach of the EU's Green Deal we maintained our opposition, aligned with other airlines, to the proposed removal of the jet fuel tax exemption since it will reduce the sector's ability to invest in more effective measures and to enable a competitive European aviation sector. IAG's technical experts and senior executives engaged with relevant officials at the European Commission, the Representations of Member States in Brussels as well as Members of the European Parliament, and with complementary contacts with the relevant authorities in the respective EU hubs, in Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona.\n\nIn the UK, IAG engaged with cabinet ministers and officials at all levels to encourage support for a UK SAF industry that can provide thousands of new jobs and see plants built in the regions of the UK. IAG advocates the use of free allowances from future revenues that airlines will pay into the UK ETS (mirroring the EU approach), to support the purchase of advanced SAF and encourage SAF production as seen in the US and Europe. We look forward to providing input to the UK's consultation on a price support mechanism for SAF production which is an essential requirement to securing investment.\n\n## Aviation policy issues\n\nPotential changes considered by the EU and the UK to the global system used to allocate takeoff and landing slots at congested airports were an important focus of government engagement throughout 2023.\n\nIAG supports the use of the Worldwide Airport Slots Guidelines (WASG) system, formulated by IATA, since it provides a stable, internationally accepted system (reflected in the relevant EU Slot Regulation and UK laws) that encourages competition but also supports reliable, established networks.\n\nIn 2023, the EU considered but halted changes to this system and the UK announced that it would consult on potential new approaches during 2024. We note that no system of allocation can solve the problem of a lack of capacity, and these should not be conflated. We therefore continue to impress on policymakers the benefits of a global system that supports new market entrants and allows network airlines to plan their complex schedules in advance so that they can offer customers a wide range of destinations and connections while also managing operational disruption effectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Some alleviations from the elements of slot rules that require airlines to operate any one slot 80% of the time to retain it in the following year have remained in place around the world during 2023. IAG welcomed such alleviations as they recognise the continuing uncertainty that global supply chain issues and short-term uncertainty in demand in individual markets have caused. As we have seen in the Middle East, in the last quarter of 2023 there are continued pressures on airlines which are often prevented from operating individual flights. We continue to advocate a pragmatic approach by airport slot coordinators to recognise the reality of factors outside airlines' control and that justify retaining slots for the longer-term benefit of airlines and their customers.\n\nSince around one third of flights in Europe operate through French airspace, the very frequent strikes by air traffic controllers in France put further pressure on operations. IAG continues to make representations with other airlines and A4E, to encourage EU and French government action to allow free movement of traffic flying over France during industrial action, a policy already adopted by several other EU Member States.\n\n- 'IAG maintained close engagement with regulators in key markets around the world to ensure positive relations and to ensure the benefits of its operations are understood.'\n\nAviation regulators' concern for the consumer interest is understandable following the disruption of 2022 and in the light of external factors, and there were related developments in different jurisdictions for IAG's operating airlines. In the EU, national authorities responded to the industry recovery and high consumer demand in different ways, ranging from proposals to cap airfares in one EU Member State, to proposals to establish minimum fares in another. IAG engaged with policymakers to explain the benefits to consumers of the choice available to them in the competitive aviation market in the EU.\n\nIn the UK, IAG engaged with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on plans to introduce an accessibility framework for airlines, to mirror its existing system that grades airports on the quality of their provision of wheelchairs. IAG's operating airlines encourage support for passengers with additional needs and believe that cross-industry engagement and communication to improve customer service will have better results for passengers affected than regulation. The UK also consulted on potential rules to restrict 'drip pricing' during online sales to ensure customers have all the relevant information at the appropriate point of purchase. Canada also introduced new requirements for airlines to set out their accessibility policies and consulted on proposals to increase passenger protection. Similarly, the US published notices of proposed rulemaking in several areas including to improve the provision of refunds to customers. At the end of 2023, the European Commission presented a proposal on multimodal passenger rights with a focus on passenger rights for access to tickets covering different transport modes.\n\nIAG responded to relevant consultations and engaged directly and through our trade associations to inform regulators, propose balanced regulation and avoid introducing additional rules that hamper the competitiveness of the industry. The Spanish Presidency of the EU in 2023 gave an additional opportunity to engage in Madrid and Brussels.\n\n## Economic regulation of monopoly infrastructure\n\nAviation infrastructure and price regulation was another area of focus in 2023. In Ireland, the DAA appealed against the Irish Aviation Authority's December 2022 decision on the maximum level of airport charges at Dublin Airport for the period 2023-2026. This decision, which takes account of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the aviation industry, also provides for a capital investment allowance of approximately \u20ac3 billion. IAG was broadly supportive of the IAA's final determination of charges and has joined the appeal proceedings as a notice party.\n\nIn Spain, IATA and Spanish airline association ALA opposed AENA's proposal to increase charges for 2024 that would break the cap in the airport regulation document (DORA II) that sets AENA's airport charges scheme for 2022-2026. IAG broadly supports the associations' objections.\n\nIn October, the UK Competition and Markets Authority confirmed through its consideration of airline and airport appeals that it was essentially satisfied with the CAA's economic review of London Heathrow airport's charges. It is positive that charges in 2024 will be lower in nominal terms than in 2023 and then essentially flat for the remainder of the regulatory period to 2026. However, the very significant increase permitted in 2022 and 2023 (despite not allowing most of the London Heathrow airport",

IAG seeks to work with the CAA and the Department for Transport to improve the regulatory framework for the future.\n\nThe importance of aviation infrastructure to airlines and their customers was highlighted by the failure of the UK's National Air Traffic Services (NATS) on 28 August due to a software failure. Although services recovered on the same day, an almost complete outage of service for several hours resulted in considerable cost to IAG's operating airlines, not only in managing the outage but also providing customers with the necessary duty of care, accommodation, communication and travel costs. IAG's airlines recognise the need to look after their customers in this way but encourage the reform of consumer regulation EU261 and the UK equivalent to recognise that ANSPs and airports should equally be responsible for the costs incurred where their actions are the cause of delays and cancellations.\n\nThis unfortunate NATS incident came during the regulator's consideration of its regulatory price review, the results of which see a 25% increase in average unit rate in nominal terms compared with 2022. This increase is driven by the fact that the regulatory system includes a traffic risk-sharing system that effectively allows NATS to recover the lost revenue from the pandemic. The decision does however include reductions in NATS En Route Limited's underlying cost base through to 2027 and provides a balance of efficiency and effective service provision.\n\nThrough A4E, IAG also engaged in discussions with the European Commission's Performance Review Body, aiming to encourage improved efficiency, better value for money and enhanced operational performance from ANSPs in Europe. IAG supports the implementation of the Single European Sky to deliver environmental and economic benefits over the longer term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## International relations\n\nIAG maintained close engagement with regulators in key markets around the world to ensure positive relations and to ensure the benefits of its operations are understood. This includes monitoring developments in international air service agreements and contributing to government talks, where appropriate, between the states in which IAG's operating airlines are based and states representing important markets around the world.\n\nFor example, in November this included attending the special meeting of the EU-US Joint Committee on air transport that explored the US' complaint against the EU relating to the reduction in capacity imposed at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. Along with other airlines, IAG contends that any such questions of capacity should be resolved with reference to the ICAO Balanced Approach that considers the benefits and negative aspects of aviation activity fairly. We welcomed the Government of the Netherlands' decision in October to halt its plans and continue to advocate the continued use of all available capacity at Amsterdam Schiphol airport and to address environmental concerns through other measures.",

There is no denying we continued to experience a number of headwinds throughout the year, many of which were outside our control and caused disruption to our customers' travel plans. This included air traffic control constraints, the August Bank Holiday National Air Traffic Services (NATS) outage, an increase in adverse weather conditions and ongoing supply chain issues. We worked hard to alleviate the factors within our control and put a renewed focus on building a more robust operation, punctuality and investment in our customer experience, our people and in our sustainability commitments as part of our BA Better World programme.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe know our people are key to our success and we're extremely grateful for their continued hard work and the outstanding contributions they make to our business.

We completed the roll out of our\n\nnew uniform, designed by Savile Row tailoring expert Ozwald Boateng, to our 30,000 uniform-wearing colleagues and began investment in transforming our workspaces, unveiling new colleague rest areas at our airports and hangars and collaborative workspaces in our offices. We're taking positive action to drive inclusion across our airline, but we don't shy away from the fact that there is more work to be done. We continue to champion and encourage our colleague-led networks and celebrate different perspectives, backgrounds and experiences. We launched an industry-leading fully-funded cadet pilot training programme, making the profession accessible to everyone. Throughout the year we recruited 7,500 new colleagues into the business and continued to build more constructive relationships with the trade unions that represent our people and enhanced our staff travel policies. Our recent colleague survey results show increased levels of engagement that indicate we're making progress in rebuilding trust with our people.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe continue to invest for our customers and remain focused on improving the customer experience and our Net Promoter Score. In 2023 we took delivery of 10 new fuel-efficient aircraft, continued to fit our business cabin seat, the Club Suite, onto our existing long-haul fleet and are providing our engagement centre colleagues with more tools and new technology to better assist our customers.\n\nWe've also ramped up our extensive transformation programme, which includes innovation across every area of our business between 2024 and 2026. We have more than 600 initiatives underway which range from trialling biometrics on selected international flights to speed up the boarding process, to using artificial intelligence and situational awareness tools to improve our operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience.\n\nWe continue to connect Britain with the world and the world with Britain, and in 2023 launched new routes to Cincinnati, Riga, Belgrade and Cologne from Heathrow and services to Aruba, Guyana, Accra, Fuerteventura and Sharm El Sheikh from Gatwick.

These results have been possible due to a favourable macroeconomic environment, and the improvement of inbound tourism to Spain, which has seen an increase in the number of tourists and levels of consumer spending.\n\nIberia has continued to be ahead of its competitors during 2023 in terms of capacity, which, along with the supplydemand imbalance we are seeing in the industry, has been a key driver of our remarkable results.\n\nWe added six Airbus A350-900, three A320neo and six A321neo aircraft to the Iberia and Iberia Express fleets, which are at the core of our transition towards a more sustainable aviation industry. We have expanded our network by opening new routes such as Doha and Cairo, and increased frequencies to important destinations such as Bogot\u00e1 and Lima.\n\nAs part of our commitment to develop the connectivity and competitiveness of the Madrid hub, we continue to make progress on our proposed acquisition of Air Europa. The acquisition remains subject to securing the required approvals and is expected to take place between 18 to 24 months after our announcement of the transaction in February 2023.\n\nIn September, we lost the handling licences at eight Spanish airports, including Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca; however, we have won and maintained the licence to operate other major airports such as Madrid Barajas.\n\n## Our people\n\nOnce again Iberia's employees have been the company's greatest asset. Team effort is what makes it possible to achieve the highest standards of quality every day.\n\nIn 2023 we reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to creating and maintaining stable and high-quality employment, and to do so we have improved the working conditions and salaries of our entire workforce.\n\nAt Iberia contractual agreements are being implemented across our businesses as a sign of our commitment to the wellbeing and professional development of our team.\n\nAt Iberia Express, we reached collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and cabin crew until 2025.\n\nIn addition, 164 pilots, 512 cabin crew and 222 maintenance staff joined Iberia's workforce.\n\n## Our customers\n\nOperational excellence and punctuality are key factors for our customers. Iberia and Iberia Express have been the most punctual airlines in Europe and Iberia fifth globally, according to the 2023 Cirum On-Time Performance Review. Also, we have reached historic levels in both NPS and customer satisfaction, by improving our engagement culture and all customer communications.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to roll out our new business cabin, thanks to the arrival of four new latest-generation Airbus A350-900s, together with two leased A350-900s. The aircraft have contributed not only to operational improvements, but also provide greater comfort in all cabins, with enhanced privacy, increased space and new lighting environments. These aircraft offer state-of-the-art connectivity and in-flight entertainment so passengers can enjoy their experience to the fullest.\n\nWe redesigned the in-flight meals throughout our network. We renewed our offering in the economy and premium economy cabins on long-haul flights by introducing a between-meals service, while our business cabin now includes healthy products, such as fresh fruit, as part of the on-board meals.\n\nAll these improvements have allowed us to retain our 4 Skytrax stars this year.\n\n## Our planet\n\nIn 2023, we continued working on the development of our sustainability strategy, to drive forward the transition of the industry.

Not only are we taking advantage of the strong recovery in demand, but we are emerging from the pandemic crisis stronger.\n\nWhen we talk about our transformation, there are some examples that say it all:\n\n- \u00b7  our punctuality placed us among the top European airlines: 80% of flights departed within 15 minutes of schedule, 4.7 points above 2019. For our customers, we are now at another level;\n- \u00b7  our line maintenance allows us to have half as many aircraft grounded for technical reasons, compared to 2019;\n- \u00b7  we drastically reduced our seasonality. In 2019 we had 40% more activity in summer than in winter. In 2023 we reduced this difference by half, allowing us to be much more efficient. We operated 8.5% more available seat kilometres in 2023 than in 2019, driven by this successful increase in winter capacity;\n- \u00b7  our ancillary revenues doubled compared to 2019; and\n- \u00b7  our load factor reached 91.4%, 4.5 points higher than in 2019.\n\nLike many airlines, Vueling was impacted in 2023 by Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine issues. We mitigated these impacts by optimising our fleet plan, re-balancing capacity across months, wet leases, and other measures.\n\n## Our people\n\nAll this has been possible thanks to the efforts of everyone at Vueling, managing day-to-day operations and supporting our transformation at the same time.\n\nReflecting the responsibility and care that we have for our people, and as part of our transformation plan, we continued improving our work environment. For example, we launched a new programme for our people's health and wellbeing, which we call 'Make It Healthy', and we organised a number of outside-of-work opportunities for people to connect, including our inaugural Vueling family and friends day.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved a critical milestone: we signed a new collective labour agreement with our cabin crews and office team in Spain, which recognises and rewards their dedication while maintaining a sustainable cost structure. Our aim remains to reach a sustainable agreement with our pilots in Spain, enabling us to unlock our growth potential.\n\nWe set down a manifesto to make clear our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. This commitment is reflected in the equity plan that we signed with our unions and in the Vueling Management Committee.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe know that customers have a choice when they fly, so we are fully focused on providing an experience that differentiates Vueling from other low-cost carriers.\n\nIn addition to delivering one of the most on-time operations in Europe, we upgraded the Vueling customer experience in other ways too. We enhanced the use of biometric technology at Barcelona, Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza and Menorca airports, implemented a new social media platform to make our case management more efficient, and partnered with industry-leading technology organisations to digitalise our customer care and disruption management.\n\nIn recognition of our outstanding customer service, Sotto Tempo Advertising gave Vueling the award for Servicio de Atenci\u00f3n al Cliente del A\u00f1o (Customer Service of the Year) in the airlines category, based on independent market research.\n\n## Our planet\n\nIncreasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply and adoption is essential for reaching Vueling and IAG's net zero carbon emissions target. Vueling engaged public institutions and potential SAF producers through workshops and roadshows, to communicate the benefits that SAF production can create for the environment, employment and the economy.

We need to reach a sustainable agreement with our pilots in Spain as a necessary condition for investment in Vueling's growth and fleet.

Strong demand for leisure travel led to an exceptional summer, delivering our highest-ever third-quarter profits.\n\nBusiness travel recovery continues to lag that of leisure, which has put pressure on profitability in the off-peak months and exacerbated the seasonality of Aer Lingus' results. We built our North Atlantic leadership position; we now have the fourth largest number of direct destinations from Europe into the US. We expanded into secondary cities, leveraging the geography and US preclearance facility at our Dublin hub, adding a new route to Cleveland which performed really well in its first year. On our European network, demand for major sun destinations and new Mediterranean routes was exceptionally strong, while the resurgence in demand for European city breaks also contributed to a strong summer. A focus on operational performance led to process improvements and quick recovery from disruption events such as the UK's aircraft control (NATS) outage in August. Nevertheless, the summer operation was challenging, most notably due to aircraft availability and to ongoing Air Traffic Control issues in Dublin, the UK and France.\n\nWe started 2023 with a new brand advert and tagline 'You're very welcome' showcasing the warmth of our service and our people. This was underpinned by 'customer first' training for over 2,500 colleagues. The strength of our brand and the improvements in customer experience were reflected in a higher Net Promoter Score.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe delivered a significant transformation in our Customer Contact Centre following the difficult post COVID-19 restart, and we are now providing a vastly improved service to customers. Technology investment, workflow change, process redesign and bot automation collectively have brought average wait times to consistently below two minutes, with 90% of calls directed to the appropriate agent. Overall customer satisfaction rates are now 30% higher than in 2022.\n\nOur investment in digital improvements is also making a difference to our customers, with additional information and functionality on our app, resulting in a better 'day of travel' experience. Our ability to continue improving the customer experience has been greatly advanced with the introduction of Salesforce, allowing us deeper insights into our customers and enabling us to offer a personalised and digital-led experience throughout their travel journey.\n\nRecognising loyalty is also important to customers. We have continued to work closely with IAG Loyalty to enhance our offers and services to AerClub members, an effective partnership that has seen us expand our AerClub membership to 2.4 million customers, a 28% increase from 2022.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur people go above and beyond every\n\nday to deliver for our customers. They are the people who make what we do possible. In 2023, we continued to improve communication and engagement with our colleagues. Our ambition is to create an inclusive environment, where our people are aligned with our strategy and recommend Aer Lingus as a place to work. We want everyone to feel empowered to own the brand promise 'We are simply people who do everything we can for the people who fly with us.' We launched a new digital communications platform company-wide, AerWaves. After only three-months, over two-thirds of our colleagues have signed up. This enables us to share knowledge while fostering a sense of belonging and teamwork in the airline. In response to feedback, we have also created an Idea Hub, where employees can contribute suggestions for continuous\n\nimprovement across the company.\n\nWe have also made significant progress in industrial relations starting with a new pay deal with Dublin Ground Handling staff and then with cabin crew based in both Ireland and Manchester. Importantly we reached a pay agreement with our line maintenance engineers which will help us retain and attract talent, while providing",

Aer Lingus ranks third in the world in terms of the proportion of female pilots (11% of our total) and we are determined to increase this, starting with the significant jump we achieved in female applications for our Future Pilot Programme in 2023.\n\n## Our planet\n\nFurther steps were made in our commitment to sustainability, and we were pleased to attain IATA's Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) Stage 2 certification.\n\nIn 2023, Aer Lingus became the first airline flying into Ireland to segregate and recycle on-board waste. We now recycle waste from over 90% of short-haul flights into Ireland and have completed trials on long-haul routes, with a target to recycle 20% of on-board waste by 2024.\n\nOther important steps in our sustainability journey in 2023 were the investment in two new Airbus A320neo aircraft, and the introduction of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) to replace diesel use in our airside ground vehicles at Dublin Airport.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn 2024 we will maintain our North Atlantic leadership from Dublin whilst continuing to offer an attractive schedule for European leisure travel.\n\nDublin Airport has lodged a planning application to increase the passenger cap at the hub airport from 32 million to 40 million passengers per year.

We are also in the process of transforming IAG Loyalty's data capabilities, which represents a major opportunity to drive our business forward by unlocking opportunities to better target potential customers. External partners continue to account for over 80% of our billed revenue. With the return of collection from flying and higher redemptions, our operating margin continues to normalise to pre-COVID-19 levels, and now stands at 22%. We are developing Avios to be a global currency, and a new partnership with Finnair will see the airline adopting Avios as its currency from 2024. Our newest retail venture, The Wine Flyer, saw strong revenue growth this year. We remain committed to launching another new business in 2024, under the direction of our new Chief growth officer.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur commitment to a compelling people proposition continued to support IAG Loyalty's success in 2023. Anchored in our people plan - encompassing talent development, people experience and culture - we continued to focus on attracting, growing and retaining engaged talent to fuel our ambitious growth plans. We remain grateful to our colleagues for all their hard work this year.\n\nAs part of our people-centric strategy, we formed colleague squads, dedicated to missions like Charity, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and our recent workspace relocation. These missions\n\nempower colleagues to deepen their connection to IAG Loyalty and play their part in enhancing the overall experience.\n\nHighlights include the selection of a new charity partner - Winston's Wish - for which we have raised almost \u00a350,000 so far, and a calendar of EDI events and moments that matter that drive a strong sense of belonging.\n\nOur colleague listening indicators show that IAG Loyalty colleagues have a strong sense of belonging and feel empowered to contribute to the success of the business in multiple ways. As we look forward to 2024, the people plan will remain integral to IAG Loyalty's growth.\n\n## Our customers\n\nIn 2023, our programme saw significant growth in member engagement compared to our previous highs in 2019. For example, members are earning 29% more Avios and redeeming 35% more Avios on average than they did in 2019.\n\nIn 2023, we launched Avios-only flights with British Airways, with 100% of seats available exclusively to Executive Club members redeeming with Avios. We also launched Avios Balance Booster, which allows customers to pay to multiply the Avios they have recently collected by one times, two times, or three times. We have been delighted with our customers' response to both products.\n\nWe also completed the transition of all the IAG airlines' loyalty programmes to a spend-based model when earning Avios. This system is simpler and fairer, and we expect member engagement to increase further as a result.\n\nWe continue to add collection partners to our ecosystem, as well as growing our relationship with newer partners like Uber. We launched six new partnerships this year, giving our customers the ability to earn Avios with new retailers and financial services providers across multiple countries. Total billings on our British Airways American Express co-brand credit card grew more than 19% this year. Spend across our UK card portfolio is now the equivalent value of more than 1% of UK GDP.\n\n## Our planet\n\n2023 has seen continued growth of member donations to charity. Iberia Plus members, through Avios Solidarios, have donated generously to support their choice of non-governmental organisation. British Airways Executive Club members have continued to support causes through the BA Better World Community Fund using Avios.

We made substantial progress, continually improving our customer experience and fostering a workplace where talent thrives.'\n\n## David Shepherd\n\nManaging Director of IAG Cargo\n\n## Business overview\n\nOur strategy has undoubtedly been put to the test during 2023, but increased premium handling capacity, improved productivity in our operations and a strong transformation programme have combined to deliver a robust performance, relative to market. I would like to thank all our colleagues around the world for their hard work and contribution to us achieving this result. The anticipated supply-side growth driven by the rebound of global passenger capacity, combined with a greater-than-expected decline in demand, has resulted in the softest global air cargo market since the 2009 global financial crisis. The resulting decline in prices from peak pandemic levels has been seen globally, although they have not receded to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWe have delivered revenues 3.5% higher than pre-pandemic 2019 levels on 14.4% lower available tonne kilometres (ATKs), despite a detrimental network mix relative to 2019 with Asian flying hindered by longer flying hours due to the Ukraine conflict. We have continued to deliver our ambitious strategy of transformation, opening our new premium operation at London Heathrow which improves our pharmaceutical offering in particular, whilst reconnecting with customers and improving both productivity and product quality.\n\n## Our people\n\nMaking IAG Cargo a great place to work continues to be a top priority. In 2023, we invested in our people in a number of ways: refreshing facilities, improving training delivery and continuing to build on a culture change founded in our core values.\n\nWe launched our new flagship development programme, Leading the Way, supported by a brand-new learning hub at our headquarters.\n\nOver 500 colleagues from 13 countries attended the course in person in 2023.\n\nWe launched Pride in Our People, IAG Cargo's first people awards programme that recognises the dedication of six individuals delivering on the themes of our values, of determined attitudes, collaborative actions, curious minds and heartfelt pride, with two special awards for rising star and leading the way.\n\nWe are making significant progress in our commitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) by advancing gender parity in an industry where it has traditionally been more difficult to do so. This includes our supporting the 2023 everywoman in Transport and Logistics Awards. We took second-place position in the Lead5050 Equity Index 2022/23, and we were finalists in two categories at the Multicultural Apprenticeship Awards 2023.\n\n## Our customers\n\nDuring 2023, our network expanded: we welcomed China back after almost two years, opened Cincinnati, an important hub for ecommerce, added a new service between Doha and Madrid, and increased capacity to Accra. Through our Partner Ready programme, we partnered with other carriers to sell routings on a more connected interline basis, growing our network and offering new routings to our customers, improving their market choice.\n\nWe invested significantly in our cargo handling capabilities, opening a semiautomated state-of-the-art Premium cargo facility at London Heathrow, over 10,000m 2 which has allowed us to double the volume of express, pharmaceutical and specialist products we manage every day. Sales of our product for the transportation of temperature-sensitive cargo, which is a key focus area for IAG Cargo, saw an 17.9% increase versus 2022.\n\nAt our Madrid hub, a \u20ac1 million investment for perishable goods was completed, expanding our handling capacity. We introduced dynamic spot rates in 2023. This capability uses artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytical technology to ensure that our pricing remains relevant and optimal at all points of sale. We have grown our distribution channels and increased digital bookings throughout the year, and our continued development in this area will move us toward a more complete digital distribution capability.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe are proud to be a socially responsible business with a real commitment to having a positive impact in the communities in which we operate.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a humanitarian emergency response supporting several charities to deliver aid to Turkey",

We continued to build for the future by further modernising our IT estate and remediating obsolescence, making steady progress with our migration to the cloud, moving toward completion in 2024. We increased our investment in IT transformation for our commercial platform and customer journey, as well as operations optimisation, and IT efficiencies and enablers.\n\nWe also invested in our Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, and data and analytics. We brought together a new IAG.ai team and launched a new London Lab to promote and strengthen our innovation and venture capital ambitions.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe continued to evolve our IT operating model to respond to changing business needs and new ways of working while continuing to deliver value for the Group. By using agile methodologies and product-led teams we can increase the pace of digital innovation and delivery for our customers.\n\nWe welcomed a new intake of graduates to our teams this year, while our cohort from 2022 continued to gain invaluable experience through their chosen postings. Our 2021 graduate cohort completed their programme, and we are proud that 13 out of 14 of them found permanent roles within the Group. In addition, all our apprentices from 2021 completed their programmes and found roles in IAG Tech.\n\nWe recruited talent to further strengthen our teams and ensured we have the right\n\ncapabilities to support our operations across the Group, particularly data scientists and engineers, welcoming 114 new hires to IAG Tech.\n\nIn addition, we provided further training and development for our people, including support and coaching for maintaining personal resilience during peak operational periods.\n\nNone of the progress we made in 2023 would have been possible without the commitment and professionalism of our people.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe made significant investments to further improve our airlines and Loyalty customer platforms with new functionality that delivers real value. For example:\n\n- \u00b7  we continuously reviewed and improved the cybersecurity controls we use to protect our data and infrastructure from cyberattack;\n- \u00b7  we are transforming our commercial platforms to provide better and customised offerings and experiences to our customers while also investing in operations optimisation and IT efficiencies and enablers; and\n- \u00b7  we continued to invest in our infrastructure to support fast, reliable, and secure services for our customers.\n\nWe continued to refresh mobile devices across front and back-office employees to take further advantage of digitalisation and better support our operations and customers.\n\n## Our planet\n\nOur innovation teams continued to look for new ways to improve our environmental sustainability, partnering across the organisation on rapid prototyping, testing and scaling up successful solutions that can provide the biggest impact. Our Hangar 51 Ventures team completed several\n\ntransactions with start-ups developing new technologies for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen-powered vehicles and airport operations to reduce waste.\n\nWith the development of our Groupwide data and analytics capabilities, we are equipping business decisionmakers with tools and insights on flight efficiency and maintenance optimisation to enable emissions reduction.\n\nWe have committed to using AI in an ethical and sustainable way, with active governance to ensure we adhere to these principles. Our aim is to become an industry leader in responsible AI to increase productivity, transform customer experience, streamline operations and remove manual toil. Through AI, we want people to be valued for their curiosity and creativity, and not for their ability to mimic robots.\n\nWe continue to look at ways to reduce the carbon footprint and energy costs of our IT estate, including through the decommissioning of legacy systems and migration to the cloud.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe will continue to invest in cybersecurity to build on the work already done and keep pace with the evolving cyber threats we face. As we continue to remove obsolescence, we will increase our investment in transformation over the next few years. We will mature our AI and automation capabilities and use data and analytics to deliver insights that will better support all areas of our business, accelerate innovation and improve fact-based decision making. Powered by Venture Capital investment, our technology and innovation will push current boundaries in sustainability, automation and customer experience.",

Our commitment has allowed us to become the leading long-haul airline in Barcelona.'\n\n## Fernando Candela\n\nChief Executive Officer of LEVEL\n\n## Business overview\n\nIn 2023, LEVEL was the leading long-haul airline at the Josep Tarradellas Barcelona - El Prat Airport. This confirms our strong commitment to the development of Barcelona's airport as a hub and the strengthening of the intercontinental connectivity through the sustained growth of our routes, which connect Barcelona to the Americas without stopovers. We increased our capacity by 33.1% versus the previous year, which is equivalent to an extra 183,000 seats. This increase in capacity has also been possible thanks to the addition of a fifth aircraft to our fleet.\n\nDuring 2023, we carried 40.5% more customers than in 2022, with an average punctuality within 15 minutes of 87.3%. LEVEL provided more than a quarter of the seats between Barcelona and the US and almost half of the seats to South America. We are the only operator in the market in five of the six destinations to which we fly.\n\n## Our people\n\nOn our sixth anniversary in June 2023, we launched our new uniforms. The project was a collaborative effort across all areas, including LEVEL's crew, in partnership with the Barcelona School of Design, as a sign of our commitment to Barcelona. The uniforms are entirely manufactured locally. The result reflects the airline's value proposition 'Fly your Way', that provides a tailor-made experience according to every customer's needs. Once again, LEVEL demonstrates that the commitment of its team is at the heart of all its decisions.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe listen to our customers, and we continue to enrich and improve the on-board experience through brand new entertainment content such as wellbeing, mindfulness and yoga. In addition, we improved our WiFi connection system, which now provides a free messaging service to all our passengers. In 2023 we have renewed our menu offering which includes nods to the local gastronomy of all the destinations to which we operate. In 2023, almost 45% of our passengers used this platform and two out of three people who had a meal included in their flight personalised their menu.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe deploy technology to further our efficiency and contribute to our sustainability objectives. Personalisation allows us to optimise the cargo onboard, reducing not only the weight and waste generated, but also food waste. We recalculate fuel needs 30 minutes before each flight's departure based on the final load of the aircraft and an updated weather forecast, which has led to a reduction of 3% of our CO2 emissions, which represents a 9.8% improvement compared to the target initially planned for 2023.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nLEVEL has initiated the procedures to obtain its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and a fleet expansion plan that envisions reaching up to eight aircraft by 2026. We will continue to stimulate growth through the strengthening and expansion of our offering and through our number of destinations, to consolidate our leadership in Barcelona. And with all of this, LEVEL will continue to give support and to promote alliances with strategic partnerships in Barcelona, our centre of operations, to continue exporting the talent of the city.\n\n<!-- image -->",

TCFD summary\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidance and first carried out TCFD-aligned scenario analysis in 2018, ahead of the UK requirement - Listing Rule 9.8 - which defines the information to be included in a company's annual report and accounts.\n\nDescriptions of TCFD recommendations are on the TCFD website. IAG has applied the TCFD Guidance for All Sectors to the disclosures in this report.

These processes are certified to international standards to ensure the fuels are safe to use. SAF can be used in existing aircraft and airport fuelling infrastructure.\n\nIAG also ensures its SAF complies with strict sustainability certification schemes, to ensure the feedstocks come from sustainable sources, and that the production processes conserve water and energy and have minimal wider impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, our total investment in SAF reached $1 billion, of which 86% is future commitments. 1 This is the largest disclosed commitment to SAF by any airline globally.\n\nIn 2023, Group airlines used more than 53,000 tonnes of SAF, an increase of 417% versus 2022, and one of the highest volumes globally. This saved around 157.1 ktCO2, accounting for 0.6% of emission reductions.\n\nIAG remains on track to deliver a 100-fold increase in its SAF volumes between 2022 and 2030, and expects to use SAF for 70% of total fuel in 2050.\n\n## Supporting advanced SAF pathways\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG continues to make direct investments in new and innovative SAF production capacity, catalysing the wider development of the SAF market. These investments are typically coupled with SAF purchase agreements, which are critical to the financial viability of the new SAF production capacity.\n\nThe Group uplifts jet fuel in multiple locations, including the US and Europe, and therefore is exploring projects in multiple regions.\n\nIAG is working with technology developers to establish a range of SAF supply options, including the projects listed in this section. We aim to be a leader in supporting developed SAF production pathways that achieve the greatest life-cycle emission reductions and can accelerate our efforts to decarbonise.\n\nIn February 2024, IAG signed its largest-ever SAF purchase agreement with Twelve, a SAF project based in Washington, which produces advanced power-to-liquid SAF made from CO2, water and renewable energy. This means we have secured one-third of the SAF required to meet IAG's 10% SAF by 2030 target.\n\nFor SAF produced from other pathways, the Group is also working to support projects which remove carbon or capture and store it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSAF is a key solution in IAG's transition plan to net zero (Section A.1.2.). It reduces carbon emissions on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis, typically by 80% or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.\n\nIn 2021, the Group set a target of using one million tonnes of SAF a year by 2030, dependent on appropriate government policy support.\n\n- 1 Based on an assumed jet fuel price of $800 per metric tonne and contracted margins for SAF production.",

The Group is therefore working closely with policymakers and industry to support the development of appropriate SAF policies needed to provide a strong investment signal and to scale up supply to meet sector demands.\n\nWe welcome the decision made by ICAO and its Member States at the third ICAO Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3), to strive to achieve a global aspirational vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030 through the use of SAF, low-carbon alternative fuels (LCAF) and other aviation clean energies.\n\nIn key markets, such as the US, EU and UK, our policy advocacy has focused in 2023 on the following areas below.\n\n| US                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | EU                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | UK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Policy overview SAF supply is currently incentivised in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Policy overview The EU has legislated under its Fit for  55 package a new ReFuelEU policy  that will set a SAF mandate from 2025.

Also within the Fit for 55 package,  the EU has agreed to amend the Emissions  Trading System (ETS) Directive, and  introduce an incentive for aircraft  operators to increase SAF uplift through  the EU ETS from 2024. This will make  it possible for aircraft operators to claim  a share of 20 million allowances set aside  by the European Commission to cover | The UK has set a SAF target of 10% by  2030, and a target to commence the  construction of five SAF plants by 2025.  In 2023, following advocacy efforts by  industry, the UK Government agreed  to develop a revenue certainty mechanism  for SAF producers, that should be in  force by 2026. Under the UK ETS, SAF is zero-emission  rated, but there currently is no incentive  comparable with policy provided under  the EU ETS.  IAG 2023 activity IAG responded to the UK's consultation  on its SAF mandate in 2023. We continue  to engage with policymakers on ways  to incentivise SAF use in the UK, |\n\n## SAF governance in IAG\n\nSAF is a key solution in IAG's transition plan to net zero emissions. In 2023, IAG enhanced its governance framework suitable for accelerating our engagement with SAF investments and policy. This included establishing a SAF Management Group, comprised of colleagues from IAG sustainability, Group finance and each operating company. The SAF Management Group reports to the SAF Steering Group. Please refer to 'Principles of sustainability governance' for more information.\n\n## Supporting emissions reductions for our customers\n\nIAG offers corporate customers the opportunity to purchase the emission reductions from SAF to support their own Scope 3 emission reductions. In total, Group airlines sold more than 150,000 tonnes of CO2 to customers last year. IAG also allocated around 150 tonnes CO2 towards internal activities, including emissions associated with travel to senior leadership conferences.",

Transition plan\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG is targeting net zero emissions by 2050 across its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\n'Net zero' means any residual emissions from IAG operations in 2050, or by the manufacture and transport of goods supplied to the Group, will be mitigated by an equivalent amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere via carbon removals.\n\nIAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 and 2050 climate targets (see below) by carrying out emission-reduction initiatives, working in collaboration with key stakeholders and proactively advocating for supportive government policy and technology development.\n\nIAG is also driving internal action by using climate-related annual incentives for over 7,500 senior executives and managers.\n\nKey measures to reduce emissions are fleet modernisation, SAF usage, marketbased measures, including the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon removals.\n\nLess than 10% of the emissions reductions between 2019 and 2050 are expected to come from offsets.\n\n## Roadmap to net zero\n\nIAG was the first airline group in the world to commit to net zero emissions, and has been publishing updates to its roadmap to this goal every year since 2019.\n\nThe version below is a core Group scenario which assumes continued policy support for aviation decarbonisation, an overall recovery to 2019 levels of passenger demand by 2024 and annual demand growth aligned with the long-term growth forecasts disclosed in notes 4 and 17 of the financial statements.\n\nChanges to our roadmap in 2023 focus on increasing the use of SAF in our operations in the short term, and our investment in carbon removals before 2030. Beyond 2030, it maintains an assumption that hydrogen aircraft will be introduced to the fleet from 2040, and a 5% emissions saving from airspace modernisation will be achieved by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPillar of carbon roadmap\n\nDelivery plans\n\nVenture investments/key innovation partners\n\n| New aircraft  and operations       | \u00b7  \u20ac12 billion investment between 2024 and 2028  for 178 new, efficient aircraft                                                                                             | ZeroAvia (hydrogen aircraft manufacturer) I6 (fuel management software) NAVflight services (flight planning services) Honeywell Forge (fuel efficiency software)   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SAF                                | \u00b7  As of 31 December 2023, our total investment in SAF  reached $1 billion, of which 86% is future commitments,  based on assumed energy prices                              | LanzaJet (sustainable fuels producer) Nova Pangaea                                                                                                                 |\n| Carbon removals                    | \u00b7  Refining the IAG carbon removals roadmap, and  supporting the inclusion of carbon removals in the global  CORSIA scheme, and UK and EU ETS CUR8 (carbon removal platform) | Heirloom (carbon capture start-up)                                                                                                                                 |\n| Market-based  measures and offsets | \u00b7  Support for the global CORSIA scheme to limit  net emissions from aviation                                                                                                | CHOOOSE (customer offsetting platform)                                                                                                                             |\n| Supply chain                       | \u00b7  90% of suppliers by spend have submitted scorecards  on ESG performance                                                                                                   | EcoVadis (business sustainability ratings)  Watershed (emissions reporting platform)                                                                               |\n\n\u0192",

Carbon removal projects differ from carbon avoidance projects, which prevent the future release of CO2.\n\n## Role in IAG transition plan\n\nGroup airlines have offered customers the opportunity to make a financial contribution to support carbon removals projects since 2022. British Airways customers have supported removals projects including mangrove restoration in Pakistan and a biochar project in Oregon, USA.\n\nBy 2050, IAG will only use carbon removals to mitigate any residual emissions from its operations.\n\nIAG will only work with suppliers who do the same, as part of meeting the Group's Scope 3 commitment. IAG is already encouraging suppliers to transition from offsets to removals as part of a new supplier contract clause which is being rolled out across its supply chain.\n\nIAG expects to use carbon removals to meet an increasing share of its CORSIA obligations between 2024 and 2035, conditional on appropriate policy, and supports wider guidance on how to transition to removals such as the Oxford Offsetting Principles.\n\nThe Group continues to advocate for policies that will accelerate global uptake of carbon removals, via the Coalition for Negative Emissions and other trade associations listed in A.1.7., and supports the inclusion of removals in the EU, Swiss and UK ETS.\n\n## Investing in carbon removals\n\nIAG is committed to supporting a variety of innovative carbon removals solutions and is considering projects that are immediately available and independently verified today, as well as more innovative technology solutions.\n\nOur investment in Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies involves a combination of forward delivery procurement and project financial support, facilitating the scale-up of GGR technologies alongside relevant government support.\n\nWhen IAG or its operating companies choose to voluntarily invest in carbon avoidance and removal projects, they work in collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence to select reputable providers and select projects carefully to meet and align with verified quality standards, such as Gold Standard, Puro Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\nIn 2023, British Airways worked in partnership with CUR8 (a UK-based company dedicated to building the global market for carbon removals), UNDO (a world-leading carbon dioxide removal project developer specialising in enhanced rock weathering), and Standard Chartered, representing financial institutions, to launch a first-of-a-kind financing pilot designed to help scale-up the carbon removals market.\n\nThe pilot aims to support the scale-up of the carbon removals market by creating a blueprint to enable carbon removal suppliers to access capital in the form of debt financing via advanced purchase agreements. British Airways has committed to purchase more than 4,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits delivered by UNDO through enhanced rock weathering, and Standard Chartered is looking to be the banking partner.\n\nIAG supports the inclusion of carbon removals in industry decarbonisation pathways, and in external assessments of support for the 1.5\u00b0C global ambition.\n\nIAG's short- and long-term targets have been independently assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned and its mid-term target assessed as well-below-2\u00b0C-aligned. The TPI assessment compared the milestones in the 2021 IAG roadmap with an industry-wide pathway modelled by the International Energy Agency (IEA), taking removals commitments into account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG began investing in ZeroAvia in 2020, a leading developer of hydrogen-electric, zero-emission aviation.

The process feeds carbon into the soil and prevents it from naturally decaying, locking carbon away and keeping it out of the atmosphere for several hundred years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Blue Carbon Mangrove project\n\nThe Blue Carbon Mangrove project in the Indus Delta area in Pakistan is a nature-based carbon removal project (where plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis). The project will support greenhouse gas removal by reforestation and revegetation of approximately 225,000 hectares of degraded tidal wetlands with mangrove and other species to absorb carbon dioxide, stabilise the area and protect the coastal area and communities.",

Metrics and progress\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG's transition plan focuses on reducing CO2 from jet fuel use, as this represents over 99% of Scope 1 emissions.\n\nThe Group measures its full carbon footprint and tracks multiple metrics each quarter to ensure progress on tackling climate change.\n\n2023 saw strong progress against the key metric of carbon efficiency.\n\nWith a 3.6% annual improvement to 80.5 gCO2/pkm, the Group is on track to deliver our carbon efficiency target of 80.0 gCO2/pkm by 2025, accounting for emissions reductions achieved from SAF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Rounded to the nearest '000 tonnes CO2e.\n- 2  Please refer to details in this section regarding Scope 3 emissions data collection. Data for Scope 3 emissions reported using existing methodology, and does not include revised values for Scope 3.1 emissions as identified following a proof-of-concept trial between IAG GBS and Watershed in 2023.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nEmissions are calculated by multiplying fuel and energy use by appropriate conversion factors that are aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. 2023 UK Government conversion factors are applied across the Group as these are deemed to be the most robust available. Other factors such as International Energy Agency emissions factors are used in specific cases as described in the IAG statement of non-financial information.\n\nOur carbon intensity calculation includes CO2 emission reductions achieved from SAF. SAF reductions are calculated using actual life cycle analysis (LCA) carbon intensity values for SAF fuel uplifted by airlines in the Group, and subtracting the achieved emission reductions from our total CO2 footprint.\n\nIAG discloses methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as Scope 1 non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), in line with the UK conversion factors.\n\nIn 2023, emissions of CH4 were 18,009 tonnes and N2O were 216,542 tonnes.\n\nA detailed Scope 3 emissions breakdown is available in the IAG statement of non-financial information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our target is to achieve a 20% drop in net Scope 3 emissions compared to the 2019 baseline, from 8.3 MT to 6.6 MT by 2030. In 2023 IAG Scope 3 emissions were 6.5 million tonnes CO2e.\n\nIAG GBS operates a supply chain sustainability programme which includes ESG scorecards and supplier risk screening.\n\nIn 2023, IAG GBS ran a proof-of-concept trial with Watershed to improve Scope 3.1 emissions reporting across the Group. In previous measurements, IAG reported Scope 3.1 emissions based on emissions calculated from water usage only. Under the trial with Watershed, a spend-based methodology for Scope 3.1 emissions was applied, combining IAG GBS supply chain spend data with Watershed's emissions database. This improved reporting accuracy as emissions factors could be associated with the location and business activities of each supplier, including supplier-specific emission factors for those with CDP disclosures. The results of this trial are provided alongside previous emissions data captured in our Scope 3 emissions submission.\n\nIAG is expanding this research across our Scope 3 activities in 2024, to improve our data collection across all Scope 3 emission categories.",

This emissions footprint is estimated using a carbon calculator, which determines a volume of CO2 emissions that an aircraft emits per passenger over a defined flight route and cabin.\n\nAdditionally, some airlines offer customers the opportunity to offset or mitigate part of their emissions through investing in carbon removals projects and/or SAF.\n\nIAG continues to develop the carbon calculation methodology that underpins our passenger emission calculators used by the Group, and advocates for an industry-wide standard that provides transparency and simplicity for customers.\n\nKey developments in 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7  Aer Lingus continues its partnership with charity Pure Leapfrog to help passengers contribute towards mitigating some of the emissions generated from their flights;\n- \u00b7  British Airways continues to collaborate with the CHOOOSE platform that enables customers to understand their flight emissions and take steps to address their climate impact before or after their journey, or directly from their seat on board. This includes carbon removals from the 'case study' projects listed in section A.1.2.;\n- \u00b7  Iberia has certified its carbon footprint calculator methodology with AENOR (third-party verification entity); and\n- \u00b7  Vueling offers its customers the opportunity to make a contribution to the supply of SAF. Vueling matches its customers' contributions, doubling the amount of SAF supplied. Almost 197,000 passengers have contributed 246 tonnes of SAF purchased since the initiative started in 2022. Passengers can also mitigate flight emissions by contributing towards the purchase of carbon removals though the collaboration with CHOOOSE.\n\n## Non-CO2 effects\n\nIAG is supporting the ongoing research and development of mitigations for the non-CO2 effects of aviation. This includes participating in the UK Jet Zero Council's non-CO2 working group, and supporting research by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).\n\nThe Group's airlines already participate in several non-CO2 research projects.\n\n- \u00b7  British Airways and Iberia are collaborating with Breakthrough Energy to identify which of our flights' trajectories pass through Ice Super-Saturated Regions (ISSR) and may contribute to non-CO2 climate effects;\n- \u00b7  Iberia participates in the IAGOS* project, which combines the knowledge of scientific institutions with the civil aviation operations to obtain essential data on atmosphere and air quality conditions for the subsequent development of more accurate climate models. New IAGOS equipment has been installed in an Airbus A330-200 which mainly operates routes across the Atlantic, providing atmospheric data from a valuable climate region;\n- \u00b7  Vueling completed several trials with SATAVIA** that aimed to reduce the creation of contrails and measure the improvements from adjustments made in-flight; and\n- \u00b7  Group airlines are also preparing to monitor, report and verify non-CO2 emissions for their future obligations under the EU ETS from 2025.\n\nIAG advocates for further scientific research to support effective policy-making that can deliver true emission reductions.\n\n- * IAGOS - In-service Aircraft For a Global Observing System",

        "page_content": "## Fuel efficiency programme\n\nAs part of the IAG sustainability commitment, each Group airline has a fuel efficiency programme which supports flight planning and enables pilots to increase fuel efficiency. Best practices are shared across the Group to leverage synergies and further increase fuel efficiency.\n\n2023 examples include:\n\n- \u00b7  British Airways and Vueling deployed NAVlink Wind Updates services in their A320 fleets. NAVlink provides optimised in-flight wind data updates, allowing pilots to plan a more efficient descent trajectory. NAVlink has proven to reduce around 22kg of CO2 emissions per descent. This partnership was developed with the support of Hangar 51 - IAG's innovation team;\n- \u00b7  Group airlines collaborated with Honeywell for the use of its Forge software. This software uses in-flight data to improve flight planning and increase fuel efficiency; and\n- \u00b7  Vueling has implemented the 'Pilot App' which provides transparent data on individual pilots' contribution towards sustainability goals. This app tracks the CO2 emissions saved during each flight, enhancing decisionmaking in their day-to-day duties.\n\n## A.1.5. Scenario analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2023, IAG carried out multiple and aligned forms of scenario analysis:\n\n- \u00b7  the IAG Sustainability team and the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team reviewed all climate-related risks and opportunities and potential impacts to 2026 and 2030. The impacts of material risks are quantified as part of the Companywide ERM process which receives Board oversight;\n- \u00b7  operating airlines modelled compliance-related costs, including from the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, to 2050;\n- \u00b7  TCFD-aligned scenario analysis was repeated using a dual timeframe of 2030 and 2050; and\n- \u00b7  ongoing analysis was carried out on the Flightpath Net Zero strategy to 2050.\n\nThis scenario work informs strategy, planning, risk management and financial management.\n\nIAG takes a proactive approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities, and is committed to managing their regulatory, reputational, financial, market and technology aspects.\n\n## Applying carbon prices\n\nIAG concurrently applies carbon prices to financial planning and to future scenario analysis.\n\nThe Fleet team uses updated carbon prices and price forecasts for short-haul and long-haul fleet purchasing decisions, based on market values and reputable external sources. The Group airlines use carbon prices in financial planning, and flight operations teams and pilots use carbon prices in operational decisions about fuel uptake.\n\nPotential acquisitions include an assessment of exposure to climaterelated issues and policy.\n\nFor the period 2024 to 2033, UK ETS prices of \u00a355 - \u00a389/tonne, EU ETS prices of \u20ac84 - \u20ac124/tonne and CORSIA prices of $11 - $25/tonne were used for modelling compliance costs.\n\nEU and UK ETS prices are based on market prices and the UK Department for Transport (DfT) Aviation Forecast, and CORSIA prices are based on internal analysis and ICAO industry price forecasts.\n\n## TCFD-aligned scenario analysis\n\nSince 2018 IAG has been incorporating the TCFD recommended guidance on climate risk disclosures. In 2023, IAG repeated a TCFD-aligned scenario analysis exercise, building on previous years' exercises.\n\nThis was a structured, qualitative discussion of potential climate-related impacts and business responses, using the latest evidence and analysis from reputable sources like the UN, EUROCONTROL and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). IAG conducted its 2023 analysis in line with the latest TCFD guidance update published in 2021.\n\nTemperature scenarios of 1.5\u00b0C 1 were chosen for transitional risks, in recognition of IAG and global targets. The 2\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C warming scenarios were chosen for physical risks, based on the latest UN projections.\n\nThe year 2030 was chosen as the key timeframe, based on IAG targets and key policy timelines, e.g. for SAF mandates. The year 2040 was also considered due to the possibility of the world overshooting 1.5\u00b0C in the 2030s leading to faster societal changes.\n\nIAG exercises involved representatives from multiple teams including Strategy, Treasury, Finance, Government Affairs, Commercial Planning, Investor Relations, People, Enterprise Risk Management, IAG Tech, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty and sustainability representatives from all operating airlines. The Group Sustainability team collated inputs, which were reviewed by the IAG Sustainability Steering Group and the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility (SECR) Committee.\n\nThe Group remains resilient to the most material climate-related impacts industry-wide policy shifts - and these have been quantified and mitigation plans embedded into financial and strategic planning. Industry-wide changes also create opportunities for the Group to become more resilient than its competitors.\n\nTo address significant uncertainty around future policy, technology and market trends, IAG is repeating this scenario analysis annually. We will keep implementing action plans in coming years to further improve resilience to wider changes.\n\n- 1 'Orderly' and 'Disorderly' scenarios were chosen as per TCFD definitions. These scenarios compare smooth, predictable and idealised climate-related changes with abrupt, variable and disjointed changes across regions.",

Risks and opportunities\n\nClimate-related risks are assessed and managed within the ERM framework as described in Section C.6. and in the Risk management and principal risks factors section under the principal risk 'Sustainable aviation'. Opportunities are managed within relevant teams.\n\nTransitional risks primarily affect airline activity between European destinations, which contributed to 34% of flying activity in 2023. Physical risks could affect IAG operations across its global network, reflecting the global nature of climate change.\n\nIAG considers the relevant risk factors that could impact each risk by region and timescale. Such variability may arise from fragmented policy definition, scope and implementation, changeable market perceptions, or unpredictable delivery of new technology (among other causes). IAG considers its mitigation strategy for each risk accordingly. Please refer to the 'Risk impacts and mitigation' table for more information.\n\nThe carbon-reduction targets in the Flightpath Net Zero strategy are the key measures for assessing the mitigation of\n\nthese risks, along with the consideration of these risks in relevant governance processes. The external risk environment, materiality of risks, mitigation actions and KPIs for these mitigating actions are reviewed regularly.\n\nThe table below lists risks assessed through the ERM process. The most material risks are policy risks. Risk timeframes align with corporate planning timelines.\n\n| TCFD  risk type   | Risk and/or opportunity combined description                                     | Risk time  frame   | Risk trend 1   | Scenario  dependency 2   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Physical          | Resilience to acute weather events                                               | M                  | Stable         | Temperature              |\n|                   | Resilience of routes and assets to chronic climate changes                       | L                  | Stable         | Temperature              |\n| Market            | Customer spend due to perceptions of ESG progress in IAG or the  aviation sector | S                  | Down           | Transition               |\n|                   | Perceived quality of offset and removal projects                                 | M                  | Up             | Transition               |\n|                   | Supply chain readiness                                                           | L                  | Stable         | Transition               |\n|                   | SAF delivery against committed offtake agreement volumes                         | M                  | Up             | Transition               |\n| Policy            | Litigation against claimed carbon reductions from offsetting                     | S                  | Up             | Transition               |\n| Policy            | Demand impact of EU and UK climate policy                                        | L                  | Stable         | Transition               |\n|                   | Resilience to changes in ETS/CORSIA pricing                                      | M                  | Up             | Transition               |\n|                   | Policy asymmetry across regions                                                  | M                  | Up             | Transition               |\n|                   | Extra regulation on activity rather than emissions                               | L                  | Stable         | Transition               |\n|                   | Lack of supporting SAF infrastructure or policy                                  | M                  | Down           | Transition               |\n|                   | Regulation on non-CO2 effects                                                    | M                  | Up             | Transition               |\n| Technology        | Access to and readiness for lower-emission technologies                          | L                  | Stable         | Transition               |\n|                   | Access to SAF supply                                                             | M                  | Down           | Transition               |\n\nKey: short-term (S) is 1-3 years, medium-term (M) is up to 5 years, long-term (L) is more than 5 years.\n\nIAG continues to analyse risk and transition scenarios to inform mitigation plans to 2030. Key parameters for defining scenarios are below, based on UN, Climate Action Tracker (CAT), UK Climate Change Committee and internal analysis. These are kept under review.\n\n| Physical risk parameters          | Current projection           | 2\u00b0C scenario    | 3\u00b0C scenario           |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Global scenario to 2100           | 2.4\u00b0C                        | RCP 3  2.6      | RCP 4.5                |\n| Transition risk parameters - 2030 | Current policies/projections | Current targets | 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenario |\n| Global emissions vs 2019          | 0%                           | -7%             | -41% (-27%) 4          |\n| UK emissions vs 2019              | -28%                         | -42%            | -42%                   |\n| EU emissions vs 1990              | -55% (via Fit for 55)        | -55%            | -62%                   |\n| US emissions vs 2005              | -37%                         | -50%            | -58%                   |\n| Aviation (net) emissions vs 2019  | -15% (via CORSIA)            | -15%            | -15%                   |\n\n- 1 Risks might be increasing (up), decreasing (down) or stabilising from a business perspective. IAG calculates this based on central strategy modelling and economic forecasting, and the risk trend shown is based on an end-of-year assessment, relative to in-year review.\n- 2  Whether the cost impacts depend more on the temperature scenario (2\u00b0C or 3\u00b0C), or type of transition (Orderly or Disorderly).\n- 3  Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), a globally recognised scenario for physical changes under different temperature ranges.\n- 4  A 41% drop by 2030 represents an Orderly transition. A 27% drop represents a Disorderly transition because smaller global emissions reductions to 2030 require rapid decarbonisation after 2030 to return to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100.",

        "page_content": "## Risks associated with SAF\n\nSAF is a key solution in IAG's transition plan to net zero (Section A.1.2.), but remains a developing market, which in many regions is still awaiting policy definition to drive infrastructure investment. IATA projects SAF production will meet just 0.5% of global aviation fuel demand in 2024 1 . IAG separates SAF risks into market, policy and technological risks associated with scaling up the global SAF industry. IAG considers the respective impacts on fulfilling IAG's 2030 commitments and future regulatory obligations, by modelling the impact of regional differences in future SAF supply and costs, associated with different policies (policy risk), SAF feedstock technologies (technology risk) and market prices (market risk). IAG uses this modelling to influence SAF strategy and investments.\n\n- 1 IATA Pressroom report: SAF Volumes Growing but Still Missing Opportunities, published 6 December 2023.\n\n## A.1.7. Stakeholder engagement Relevant standards: GRI 10213/43/44 Overview\n\nThe aviation industry will decarbonise faster with stakeholder and policy support.\n\nThe Group and its operating airlines regularly engage with key stakeholders: governments and regulators, shareholders, lenders and other financial stakeholders, trade associations, customers, suppliers, employees, communities, NGOs and academic institutions to advocate for support for emissions reductions and to share progress on Flightpath Net Zero.\n\nFollowing our successful first IAG ESG day for investors in 2022, IAG delivered a sustainability update as part of its Capital Markets Day in November 2023.\n\nInternal governance ensures that wider stakeholder engagement on climate change is consistent with material issues and environmental goals.\n\n## Key stances on climate change\n\nIAG supports cost-effective approaches to deliver net zero emissions by 2050, advance low-carbon solutions, and support global efforts to align with 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nActions within associations focused on UK aviation, Spanish aviation and global aviation policy are listed in the table opposite. If the climate-related positions of trade associations are deemed to be substantially weaker or inconsistent with these internal stances, IAG representatives take roles on task forces and working groups and respond to consultations to communicate our position and constructively move to alignment.\n\nLuis Gallego participated in a sustainability panel at the Sustainability Skies World Summit 2023.\n\nIAG is proud to have consistent views on climate change with all the organisations of which it is a member (below). IAG has positively influenced this outcome by contributing expertise and time to drive net zero commitments, and create and support roadmaps to net zero emissions across SA, A4E, oneworld, JZC, and ATAG. IAG has also driven and encouraged higher SAF ambitions across the JZC, oneworld and WEF. IAG and key trade associations are listed on the EU Transparency Register.\n\n## Key principles of climate-related engagement\n\nAviation is a global industry and IAG remains committed to global policy approaches.\n\nIAG supports carbon pricing as a key instrument to determine both the pace of emissions reductions for the aviation industry and the balance of in-sector and out-of-sector reductions. We advocate for the use of greenhouse gas emission removal technologies in carbon markets, by both natural and engineered means. By 2050 we are committed to using only GGRs to cover our residual carbon emissions.\n\nIAG prioritises policy advocacy on SAF too, as this is a key emissions reduction driver in the next decade, and supports policies on operational efficiency, zero-emission aircraft and carbon offsets and removals.\n\nThe Group seeks to ensure that policies delivered are effective and fair across multiple airlines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The JZC aims to provide advice on the Government's ambitions to deliver net zero aviation and zero-emission flights. It brings together ministers and CEO-level stakeholders, with regular meetings and subgroups to drive the ambitious delivery of new technologies and innovation to cut aviation emissions. Through the success of the JZC, several countries have followed its example, including in Spain and Ireland.\n\nIn 2023 IAG supported the JZC's focus on SAF. This included the UK Government's second consultation on SAF, participation in the SAF mandate sub group and the commercialisation sub group, and supporting a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF, which the UK Government has now committed to through the UK Energy Bill.\n\nThe Ninth Jet Zero Council focused on greenhouse gas removal technology, and BA showcased its nature-based carbon removal projects\n\nLeft: Mark Harper, Secretary of State for Transport, UK Government Right: Jonathon Counsell, Group Head of Sustainability, IAG\n\n## Spain - Alianza para la Sostenibilidad del Transporte A\u00e9reo en Espa\u00f1a (Spanish Alliance for Sustainable Air Transport)\n\nThe Spanish Alliance for Sustainable Air Transport (AST) was launched in April 2023. The AST is a joint initiative comprising the air transport industry, academia, and NGOs to promote the development of sustainable aviation in Spain, favouring the implementation of new technologies and innovative processes that make the long-term sustainability of the sector possible, and boost pathways towards decarbonisation. Iberia played a key role in creating the AST, and both the Iberia and Vueling CEOs are members.\n\n## Ireland\n\nIn 2023, the Irish Government announced plans to establish a Government-Industry SAF forum to inform and guide its work on SAF.\n\nIAG welcomed this announcement and Aer Lingus is continuing to engage at European level, and with the Irish Government on policy support to incentivise SAF production in Ireland.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Waste\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 306-1/2/3 (2020).\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG has one of the most comprehensive waste reduction plans in the airline industry. Our priorities include reducing food waste, and eliminating the use of single-use plastics, in addition to increasing recycling across our operations.\n\nOn-board services are the main source of waste. Key waste outputs include plastic packaging, leftover food waste,\n\ndrinks cans and cabin items such as wrappers. Key inputs included on-board meals and amenity kits supplied to passengers.\n\nIn 2023, IAG operations generated:\n\n- \u00b7  52,699 tonnes overall (52,655 tonnes in 2022); comprised of\n- \u00b7  51,749 tonnes non-hazardous waste; and\n- \u00b7  950 tonnes hazardous waste.\n\nWe recovered or recycled 7,650 tonnes (19%).\n\nWaste is typically offloaded and processed at airports by third-party caterers, with some materials recovered on-site and other materials incinerated or sent to landfill. The majority of cabin and catering waste is processed at IAG's hub airports - Barcelona, Dublin, London and Madrid - although the Group flies to over 200 airports worldwide.\n\nBelow is the Group's most comprehensive waste disclosure to date. Waste trends are stabilising with the return to normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic and IAG remains committed towards delivering our 2025 goals.\n\n| Metric                                    |      | 2019 base 2025 target   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |       | 2020   | Unit vly                         |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|----------------------------------|\n| On-board waste per passenger              | 0.33 | 0.26 (-20%)             | 0.32   | 0.41   | 0.47   | 0.75  | (22%)  | Kg/pax                           |\n| Office waste per full-time employee       | 95.7 | 47.8 (-50%)             | 81.8   | 83.0   | 103.1  | 124.5 |        | Kg/FTE (1%)                      |\n| Maintenance waste per unit of activity    | 0.63 | 0.47 (-25%)             | 0.11   | 0.12*  | 0.28*  | 0.38* | (8%)   | Kg/person-hr                     |\n| Cargo waste per unit of cargo carried     | 1.55 | 1.16 (-25%)             | 1.54   | 1.59   | 1.43   | 1.59  |        | Kg/tonne cargo (3%)              |\n| On-board waste at hubs recycled/recovered | 24%  | 40%                     | 20%    | 24%    | 26%    | 31%   | (4pts) | %                                |\n| Office waste recycled/recovered           | 35%  | 60%                     | 26%    | 26%    | 13%    | 16%   | 0pts   | %                                |\n| Maintenance waste recycled/recovered      | 50%  | 70%                     | 72%    | 60%    |        | 35%   | 12pts  | % 45%                            |\n|                                           | 63%  | 80%                     | 77%    | 59%    | 61%    | 55%   | 18pts  | Cargo waste recycled/recovered % |\n\nNote: * means restated using the latest data and assumptions.\n\n## Commentary on key metrics\n\n| Key metrics                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall waste                  | Includes waste from all streams - on-board, office, cargo and  maintenance waste - and an extrapolation of waste processed  at overseas airports, where waste destinations are not always  reported by third parties.   | Waste volumes have increased less than 1% in  2023. This is despite activity levels returning  to pre-pandemic levels. Please refer to examples of  waste reduction initiatives across the Group for  more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Waste  recycling and  recovery | Includes re-use, downcycling, upcycling, composting and  anaerobic digestion. Regulations, including International  Catering Waste (ICW) regulations, limit the amount which  can be recycled.                          | Overall recycling/recovery rates are 19%. Recycling  of maintenance and cargo waste has increased  significantly owing to initiatives implemented in  this section of the report. Onboard recycling has  fallen year-on-year as operations recover to  pre-pandemic levels. Office waste has not  increased year-on-year, but initiatives launched in  2023, such as new recycling bins at Waterside, are  expected to deliver an increase in office waste  recycling rates in 2024. |\n| Single-use  plastic (SUP)      | Items made wholly or partly of plastic and are typically  intended to be used just once or for a short period of time  before they are thrown away.

Noise and air quality\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 305-7.\n\nIAG has delivered a 14% reduction in noise per take-off and landing cycle (LTO) versus 2019, driven by fleet renewal. Noise per take-off has improved by 3% from 2022 levels owing to the use of newer, quieter aircraft and changes in the mix of short-haul and long-haul operations following the COVID-19 pandemic. IAG remains committed to reducing the impact of aircraft noise and air pollution on local communities near airports and supports innovation as a means of delivering this. Noise and air quality performance are monitored using national databases and global aircraft noise standards.\n\nGroup airlines continue operational practices to minimise noise impacts, such as the use of continuous descents. They engage with stakeholders such as community groups, regulators and industry partners to understand their concerns and participate in research and operational trials to identify and refine solutions.\n\n## Noise reduction targets\n\nIAG is updating noise reduction targets as flying levels return to pre-pandemic levels.

Iberia Airport Services holds an ISO 14001 in all the airports at which it operates, with the aim of guaranteeing that an environmentally responsible service is provided to its customers.\n\nIn line with our commitment to supporting a more responsible supply chain, British Airways and Iberia respond annually to the EcoVadis questionnaire. EcoVadis is a market-leading provider of business ESG ratings. The response to this questionnaire is supported by the Group's policies and practices, such as supplier engagement policies administered by IAG GBS, which also allows us to identify points of improvement to annually improve the score of all Group airlines.\n\nAs part of our supply chain management objectives and our partnership with EcoVadis, IAG GBS has screened 90% of IAG's spend using EcoVadis scorecards, which means screening more than 550 suppliers.\n\n| Airline         | EcoVadis 2023 score   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| British Airways | Bronze                |\n| Iberia          | Silver                |\n\n## IAG third-party ESG assessments and awards\n\nThe Group also continues to provide evidence to support third-party ESG disclosures and rating assessment frameworks.\n\nIn 2023, IAG has been awarded an A- grade by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for its climate change disclosure, which assessed more than 21,000 companies globally on climate action. This is the fourth year IAG has achieved a 'leadership' rating of Aor higher, the longest consecutive leadership rating of any airline, and places the Group in the top 25% of respondents worldwide.\n\nIAG was also the highest ranked aviation group in the global Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) in 2022, which assesses 600 companies across 47 countries on their readiness for the low-carbon transition. IAG is in the top 10% of airlines assessed by Sustainalytics, which gives ESG risk ratings to around 15,000 companies worldwide based on public disclosures.\n\nIAG was also awarded 2024 Eco-Airline of the year by Air Transport World for industry leadership and a best-in-class SAF programme, while Aer Lingus received the Aviation Sustainability and Environment award at the Irish Aviation 2023 Awards.\n\n| Reporting requirement   | Current rating                                                     | Comments                                                                                |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| TPI                     | Highest-ranked airline in 2022 TPI climate ratings  (Score: 17/18) | TPI assess around 600 companies on their  readiness for a low carbon transition         |\n| CDP                     | A- rating in 2023 (top 25%)                                        | Leadership rating achieved for fourth consecutive  year, longest running of any airline |\n| Sustainalytics          | Top 10% of airlines in 2022                                        | Sustainalytics provide ESG ratings to around  15,000 companies                          |\n\nFor IAG's engagement with the Transition Pathway Initiative, please refer to section A.1.2. of this report.

The IAG model empowers each operating company and platform business to deliver for its customers and people - with each being responsible for managing recruitment, pay and conditions for their colleagues, as well as careers and development - while centrally we look at opportunities for synergies across the Group.\n\nEach operating company and platform business has its own culture and values which support its unique brand, business, customer and employee propositions. At IAG, we hold commitment, pragmatism, execution, ambition, resilience, challenge and innovation, responsibility, people focus and team players as key values that enable us to fulfil our purpose. These are woven throughout our ways of working, people processes and our people strategies.\n\nColleagues have consistently demonstrated these values in responding to the various challenges and opportunities they have faced across the year. We've made substantial headway in rebuilding capacity, enhancing resilience and flexibility, and making transformative changes in our business, whilst navigating operational challenges, particularly in British Airways and Aer Lingus.\n\nAcross the Group, our focus on culture and values is essential to our transformation and the execution of our strategy. Our operating companies are working to constantly evolve their cultures to enable their businesses to be more competitive and achieve our transformation agenda and to provide a great working environment in which all colleagues can thrive. We measure progress on our culture through a six-monthly Organisational Health Index (OHI) survey sent to all employees and through other employee listening channels (see the Stakeholder Engagement section for details). Insights from these channels feed into our operating companies' priorities for improving and progressing our people policies, ways of working and shaping our people strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, our primary focus was to build back capacity to support our business and operations. In 2023, we have been able to focus on a broader range of people initiatives including:\n\n- \u00b7  investing in the skills of our workforce and commitment to professional development and careers - including our award-winning apprentice programmes and our pilot and leadership programmes;\n- \u00b7  building the culture within each of our operating companies creates a positive colleague experience and drives customer-centricity and operational performance. Twice-yearly organisational health surveys enable tracking of progress and help focus people plans;\n- \u00b7  continuing to make progress towards our ambition of 40% senior leadership roles held by women by 2025. At year end 2023 we have 36% of senior roles held by women, a two-point increase in 2023 versus 2022 and an overall increase of six points since 2020;\n- \u00b7  building on initiatives already carried out in some of the operating companies, in 2023, we launched a voluntary, anonymous and confidential online survey to our senior leaders across the Group to gain a deeper understanding of the composition and diversity of IAG's senior leadership, going beyond gender to include a broad range of factors regarding identity. The survey results will be shared with senior leaders to inform IAG's people strategies and provide a baseline of the diversity of IAG's senior leaders, enabling us to track progress over time and support\n\ndiscussions around equity, diversity and inclusion. An output of the survey feeds into the UK Parker Review, which focuses on ethnic diversity of Boards and senior leadership teams. 6% of our UK senior leaders selfdisclosed as ethnically diverse and our senior leaders globally represent over 20 nationalities. To ensure continued focus on increasing ethnic representation, we have introduced an ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for the Group's UK senior leadership population by the end of 2027;\n\n- \u00b7  continued focus on creating an inclusive and diverse culture and organisation, encompassing the promotion of equity, diversity and inclusion, and upholding Group-wide policies designed to eradicate discrimination;\n- \u00b7  supporting the wellbeing of our colleagues through the provision of a range of health, financial, and lifestyle benefits. Each operating company is committed to creating a positive work environment and to actively contributing to and supporting the overall wellbeing of every colleague;\n- \u00b7  supporting colleagues through the broader transformation of the business including digitalisation, artificial intelligence, modernisation of our fleet, investments in customer and products; and\n- \u00b7  operating companies have actively engaged with trade unions to secure balanced agreements, ensuring fair and competitive remuneration. These negotiated agreements provide a critical foundation to support investment and foster growth.",

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 405-1\n\nAt IAG we are proud of the diversity of the workforce across our Group companies and the richness of backgrounds, experiences, cultures and ideas that makes our businesses thrive. Our aim is that all colleagues feel their unique difference is recognised and valued. IAG continues to bring positive change and progress towards our equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) ambition to create a diverse and inclusive culture representative of the communities we live and work in and the customers we serve. We also believe that a diverse workforce performs better and is more resilient, innovative and productive.\n\n## Progress on gender diversity\n\nWith regards to gender, our Board comprises 45% women, the IAG Management Committee 25% women and we have over 44% of women across our workforce. In 2022, we set a Groupwide ambition to have 40% of senior leadership roles held by women by 2025. We have seen a significant increase in gender diversity in senior leadership to 36% in 2023, a two-point increase since 2022 and six points since 2020 and are on track to achieve our 40% ambition.\n\n## Going beyond gender\n\nOur Group-wide plans go beyond gender, and we are implementing a range of initiatives to support our diversity and inclusion ambition, whilst recognising the cultural sensitivities and legal contexts we operate in globally, and the need to comply with evolving reporting requirements.\n\nIn 2023, we partnered with an independent UK-based talent and diversity consultancy, Green Park, to gain a deeper understanding of the composition and diversity of our senior leaders, going beyond gender to include a broad range of factors regarding identity. A voluntary, anonymous and confidential online survey was sent to senior leaders across the Group.\n\nWe are delighted that 88% of our senior leaders globally responded to the survey (193 out of 219 1 leaders invited) with a 96% response rate in the UK (91 out of 95 leaders invited). While some of the operating companies were already capturing broader demographic data shared by colleagues, this is the first time we have surveyed our senior leaders across the Group with questions tailored to local legal and cultural contexts.\n\nThe survey provides a baseline to better understand the diversity of our senior leadership population, enables us to track progress over time and to continue and broaden our dialogue with our senior leaders around equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Two leaders responded Prefer not to Say and four did not consent to their data being processed.\n\nWe recognise that we have progress to make and are introducing an ambition for 10% of the Group's UK senior leadership population to identify as ethnically diverse by the end of 2027. This has the support of both the Board and Management Committee. We have decided to focus our ethnicity ambition on the UK as ethnicity and race are well-defined characteristics aligned with census data. We support the recommendations of the Parker Review in the UK both in terms of reporting the ethnic diversity of our Board and senior leaders, and in setting an ambition for 2027.\n\nGiven IAG's global focus we see great value in having diverse ethnic, national and cultural backgrounds represented in the workforce: across our 71,794 colleagues, we have over 150 nationalities. The survey highlighted that our senior leaders globally represent over 20 nationalities. In the UK, 34% of senior leaders self-disclosed as a nationality other than British.\n\nThe survey results are being shared with our senior leaders and used to inform our people strategies. We remain committed to creating a diverse and inclusive culture. We will continue to uphold Group-wide policies designed to eradicate discrimination and to focus on open and transparent people processes, mindful choices of search partners, diverse recruitment shortlists and more rigorous definitions of critical role requirements, focusing on capabilities rather than experience.\n\nRight: British Airways' celebration of Black History Month\n\nLeft: British Airways' Diwali celebrations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethnicity reporting methodology\n\nOur data relies on senior leaders self-disclosing their diversity status. Individuals who have chosen not to report their ethnicity are not included in the calculation as minority ethnic leaders.\n\nWe use the following methodology to calculate:\n\n## % of ethnically diverse senior leadership in UK\n\n=\n\n## (Total number of UK leaders who self-identify as minority ethnic)\n\n(Total number of senior leaders in UK)\n\nAligned with the UK Parker Review guidance:\n\n- \u00b7  a leader is identified as 'minority ethnic' if they self-disclose as one of the following groups: Asian, Black, Mixed/Multiple, Other (with the option to describe the ethnicity) or Prefer to Self-define (where the ethnicity maps to an ethnic minority category); and\n- \u00b7  a leader is not included as 'minority ethnic' if they identify as White, Prefer not to Say, Do not Consent to data being processed, Prefer to Self-define (where the ethnicity does not map to an ethnic minority category) or did not reply to the survey.\n\nThree different surveys were designed for the UK, Ireland and Spain - aligned to each country's legal and cultural context - using local census questions and classifications. In some countries we did not include the ethnicity question due to the legal and cultural context. Where collected, the ethnicity results provided to IAG have been aggregated and mapped to the UK ONS classification categories.\n\nData is held by Green Park and only shared with IAG and its companies for reporting at an aggregate level with minimum thresholds to safeguard anonymity.\n\nWe define senior leaders as IAG grades 0, 1 and 2 or equivalent across the Group, including Senior Executives (direct reports to IAG's CEO).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year several operating companies participated in WiHTL's EDI maturity assessment and benchmarking exercise, in partnership with the Centre for Diversity Policy Research and Practice at Oxford Brookes Business School. Both at Group and operating company level we continue to collaborate with industry peers and were recently awarded the WiHTL 'Most Engaged Member' at its 2023 Inclusion Summit.\n\nWe actively partner with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and are committed to advancing gender diversity as part of IATA's 25 by 2025 strategy (a global initiative to enhance EDI and gender balance in the aviation sector).\n\nEach airline is looking at increasing the diversity of its pilot populations through talent attraction and recruitment practices and through school engagement and outreach programmes. British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia have launched fully or semi-funded pilot cadet programmes.\n\n## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion examples\n\nAer Lingus has made strides in gender diversity within the Future Pilot Programme, with the first successful cohort comprising approximately 27% women. Aer Lingus currently has 11% of pilot roles filled by women, the thirdhighest gender representation of pilots of all airlines globally (Source: International Society of Women Airline Pilots 2021).\n\nBritish Airways launched the Speedbird Pilot Academy, funding 70 spaces aimed at removing financial barriers to entry for pilot roles, while also introducing the 'Be an Original' inclusion and diversity learning programme for all colleagues. British Airways also launched a reverse mentoring programme pairing 80 senior managers with colleagues from under-represented ethnicities to promote awareness and improve inclusion. Additionally, British Airways focused on increasing representation through internships, apprenticeship\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogrammes and work experience placements - opening up different entry routes to a higher proportion of ethnic minority colleagues and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. As it participates in Europe's largest event for black entrepreneurs, British Airways actively encourages and engages in cultural activities that are important to colleagues across the business.\n\nIAG Cargo introduced a new training hub with a flexible bank holiday policy to promote inclusivity. Additionally, it has revamped its prayer room and nursing room to be fully accessible. IAG Cargo took second place in The Equity Index 2022/23 produced by Lead 5050, a UK cross-industry accreditation body, that ranks firms using official data on average salaries, bonuses, and pay at every level. The business also supported the 'everywoman in Transport and Logistics Awards' that promotes and inspires women within the industry.\n\nIAG GBS is actively fostering an inclusive workplace through the initiatives of its Inclusion Network/Community Groups, including the LGBTQ+ Network and Working Parents and Carers Network. A strategic partnership with MyGWork, the largest professional speciality platform for the LGBTQ+ community, offers a range of collaborative efforts such as job postings, speaker events, Pride celebrations and access to a substantial talent community.\n\nIAG Loyalty engaged a representative group of colleagues focused on driving an inclusion and belonging agenda. The group designed and led a calendar of EDI events and experiences based on colleague listening and survey data. There have been high levels of engagement across all topics including Pride, International Women's Day, Menopause Day, Baby Loss Awareness, Ramadan and other events designed by colleagues, for colleagues.\n\nIAG Tech proudly supports women in the tech sector, sponsoring the 'Outstanding Women of the Year' award at the Women in Tech event and maintaining job postings on platforms such as the Diversity in Tech website.\n\nVueling and Iberia have refreshed their equality plans this year. Noteworthy progress at Vueling includes an increased percentage of women in management positions. Iberia's strategic focus through a supported network of over 200 colleague diversity ambassadors who help raise awareness, identify organisational barriers and who are consulted on company processes. This is supplemented with mandatory training for the entire company.\n\n## Co-parenting responsibilities Relevant standards: GRI 401-3\n\nThe Group's operating companies prioritise work-life balance, especially in the context of co-parenting responsibilities. They have a range of policies covering job-sharing, maternity, adoption, paternity and shared parental leave to support employees managing co-parenting commitments. Online platforms facilitate a collaborative community for working parents and carers, enabling the exchange of ideas and mutual support, while also providing access to digital resources offering valuable information for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.\n\nIAG Loyalty, as one of its focus areas, looked at parental leave with an equity lens, emphasising support for both parents rather than just the primary carer or birthing parent. This initiative applies in both the UK and Spain.",

Of this, 36 per cent came from customer contributions, 39 per cent from Company donations, 17 per cent from employee contributions, and 8 per cent from in-kind donations.\n\n| Metric       | GRI Standard   | Unit      | vly   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------|----------------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total raised |                | \u20ac million | 14%   |    7.4 |    6.5 |    2.7 |    4.6 |    5.7 |\n\n## Group operating companies have partnerships with a range of organisations including:\n\nDisasters Emergency Committee (UK), Flying Start (UK), Save the Children (Spain), Lovaas Foundation (Spain), Dublin Pride (Ireland), Special Olympics (Ireland), Business vs Smog (Poland), Noble Gift (Poland), UNICEF (global)\n\nslavery clauses feature in all new supplier contracts as well as contract renewals, which require full compliance with all applicable anti-slavery and human trafficking laws, statutes, regulations and codes.\n\nIAG remains committed to taking swift and robust action if any evidence relating to slavery or human trafficking in our business supply chain is identified.\n\nIAG is taking steps to prevent human trafficking. Human trafficking is of particular concern to IAG and to the wider aviation industry, as the Group transports millions of passengers every year and has tens of thousands of suppliers across the world. Operating airlines work closely with governments and the airports in which they operate to ensure that any suspected trafficking on our flights is identified, reported and\n\ndealt with appropriately. IAG also supports the 2018 IATA resolution denouncing human trafficking and reaffirming a commitment to tackle this issue and the ICAO Guidelines for Reporting Trafficking in Persons by Flight and Cabin Crew - in addition to actively contributing to the ICAO Ad Hoc Working Group on Combating Trafficking in Supply Chain (AHWG-TSP), an international, joint industry-regulatory group providing advice to ICAO assisting in the development of guidance material on combating trafficking in persons in an air operator's supply chain.\n\nOperating airlines also train staff to recognise and respond to the signs of potential human trafficking situations and provide procedures for reporting where any cases are suspected.",

Sustainability strategy\n\nIAG's vision is to be a world-leading airline group on sustainability.\n\nThat means using its scale, influence and track record to not only transform the business but drive the system-wide changes required to create a truly sustainable aviation industry. IAG is committed to delivering best practices in sustainability programmes, processes and impacts, while executing Group strategy.\n\nIAG aligns its environmental strategy with the three overall strategic priorities of the business described in the Strategy section.\n\n## Material issues\n\nIAG focuses its sustainability strategy on addressing material issues: those which are most important to key stakeholders and which have the biggest external impacts.\n\nTo identify these issues over a three-year timeframe and to 2030, IAG repeated a materiality assessment in 2021 which was facilitated by an independent third party. External stakeholders included investors, corporate customers, policy makers, trade associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and NGOs. Internal stakeholders included IAG Board members, all IAG Management Committee members, and operating company sustainability representatives. The results inform ongoing disclosures and strategy.\n\nIn our 2021 materiality assessment, tackling climate change was identified as the most material issue in the long-term. In the short-term, as the business recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, profitability and customer and employee engagement and wellbeing remain high priorities.\n\nIAG does not have specific risk provisions, targets or guarantees related to non-material issues such as water consumption, biodiversity, raw materials consumption, or light pollution. More information on water and biodiversity is available in the Additional Disclosures section of the IAG statement of nonfinancial information.\n\nIAG will seek a double materiality assessment when it next repeats this analysis in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An annual meeting planner for the Board ensures sustainability governance processes fit within the reporting and disclosure framework of the Group.\n\nThe Group's unique structure means that each individual operating company has a distinct sustainability programme. These are regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the Group sustainability strategy and principles, which covers material issues, KPIs and engagement plans.\n\nRelevant forums and levels of responsibility are indicated below.

Workforce governance Relevant standards: GRI 2-30, 404-1,\n\n## 404-2.\n\nEach operating company within IAG is committed to creating a work environment in which safety and wellbeing are paramount, in which employees are treated fairly and rewarded appropriately, and feel motivated and can thrive. We believe our employees are central to the continued success of the Group.\n\n## Working policies and rights at work\n\nAt IAG our core principles include fair and equal treatment, non-discrimination, fairness and respect for human rights. These are central to our IAG Code of Conduct which applies to all employees and directors across the Group. Employees have been equipped with comprehensive training and development opportunities, ensuring they are well-versed in essential topics such as the Code of Conduct and Compliance with Competition Laws.\n\nOperating companies are responsible for their own supplementary employee policies and procedures, including appropriate reward frameworks aligned to local markets and roles, so they remain competitive in attracting the best talent. We have seen a wide selection of employee benefits and recognition schemes introduced in the operating companies. For senior leader remuneration across our operating companies, we have deliberately focused on variable pay and long-term incentives, aligning leadership compensation with performance and long-term strategic goals to drive performance. We have taken a restrained approach to executive pay, remaining committed to fairness and competitiveness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCollective bargaining arrangements are in place for 87% of the workforce.\n\nOur operating companies have focused on securing collective bargaining agreements with unions to ensure fair, competitive and sustainable pay providing stability for our business and colleagues in challenging times.\n\nIAG complies with International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. These conventions cover fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association, the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nIAG operating companies have effective dialogue through employee forums and through trade unions where they are recognised. In addition, the IAG European Works Council (EWC) facilitates communication and consultation between employees and management on transnational European matters. The EWC includes representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) countries. It meets regularly throughout the year to inform and, where appropriate, consult on transnational matters which impact employees in two or more EEA countries.\n\nEach operating company continues to focus on engagement, listening and acting on colleague feedback. In addition to specific initiatives to measure employee satisfaction, IAG runs a twice-yearly Organisational Health Index (OHI) survey to track our transformation and culture development, and to benchmark management practices and leaders against a global external framework. Alongside leadership support, each operating company has established teams to identify themes and incorporate these into broader people plans.\n\nFinally, Board members carry out workforce engagement visits with colleagues across our operating companies - meeting a variety of employees and leaders in their work context to better understand the challenges and opportunities of the different businesses, employee issues and levels of engagement. This is shared with the Board to provide a balanced perspective of stakeholder views and to support broader decision-making.\n\n## Training and development\n\nEach operating company is responsible for the learning, development and talent management within its business and ensuring its workforce has the necessary skills to support its strategy.\n\nWhile training policies and programmes are implemented at the operating company level, all companies are required to run mandatory corporate training courses on topics such as the Code of Conduct, Compliance with Competition Laws, Anti-bribery and Corruption Compliance, and Data Privacy, Security, and Protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## C.4. Supply chain governance Relevant standards: GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2. Overview\n\nIAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) continues to engage with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure all products and services provided to IAG are on a path to net zero by 2050.\n\nThe IAG GBS Group Procurement team leads the Supply Chain Sustainability Programme by delivering in four key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC);\n- \u00b7  Independent risk screening and sustainability assessments;\n- \u00b7  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Audits; and\n- \u00b7  Embedding sustainability as standard in the procurement process.\n- 1 Average training hours is based on the total training hours performed per average headcount, pro-rated to Full Time Equivalent (FTE)",

        "page_content": "## Activities in 2023\n\nThe SCoC continues to be shared with new suppliers as part of the onboarding process. New suppliers are requested to acknowledge their commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and the need for a roadmap, supported by deliverable plans, to achieve this target.\n\nIAG GBS is also partnering with EcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, to assess supplier scorecards with a comprehensive methodology covering environment, labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.\n\nThis gives IAG and its suppliers a baseline for improvements, and suppliers can share them with customers and other stakeholders, which benefits wider industry sustainability. Once a scorecard is shared with IAG GBS, results are reviewed to ensure the suppliers sustainability performance is aligned with IAG's vision and strategy. If a supplier's performance score is assessed as less than 45 (out of 100), a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is requested for improvement.\n\nIAG became a SEDEX member in 2023. SEDEX provides data insights to help companies improve ESG performance. As part of the SCoC adherence and legislation requirements under the UK Modern Slavery Act, suppliers are subject to third-party audit under a labour and human rights protocol such as the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology. In 2023, 38 of these audits were completed. By joining SEDEX, IAG aims to understand information about the ethical practices of their suppliers, including audits.\n\nAll suppliers also undergo annual compliance screening for any legal and financial risks. The Group Procurement and Compliance teams assess any suppliers identified as having potentially higher levels of risk and implement mitigation plans where necessary. Any issues are flagged to the risk owners within the Group to jointly take appropriate action.\n\nIAG GBS has embedded sustainability aspects into the day-to-day operation of the organisation and included sustainability targets in the performance objectives of all IAG GBS employees.\n\nIAG GBS has verified the existing, active supplier base and IAG's airlines' interline relationships in Russia and Belarus in order to determine the potential implications of, and actions to be taken, due to the trade sanctions issued as a response to the war in Ukraine. IAG has provided operating companies with support on mitigation actions to be taken (e.g. payment stop/blockage). This has been performed in coordination with Compliance Teams.\n\n## Building a sustainable future in 2024\n\nIn 2024, IAG GBS will work to have EcoVadis scorecards in place covering 90% of IAG's total spend. 'High-risk' suppliers based on SEDEX's risk assessment will also be required to perform an independent SMETA audit.\n\n## Timeline of supply chain engagement activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tracking metrics and progress\n\n|                                                  | GRI Standard   | vly        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total number of suppliers                        |                | 14% 15,998 |        | 14,045 | 13,272 | 22,947 | 27,033 |\n| Suppliers screened                               |                | 14%        | 15,998 | 14,045 | 13,272 | 22,947 | 18,369 |\n| Suppliers with additional compliance assessments | 308-2,         | (28%) 400  |        | 557    | 1,510  | 1,818  | 2,912  |\n| Critical suppliers under regular risk monitoring | 414-2          | (41%)      | 19     | 32     | 34     | 35     | n/a    |\n| Independent CRS audits                           | 308-2,         | 19%        | 38     | 32     | 30     | 25     | 28     |\n| Total number of EcoVadis' scorecards             | 308-2,         | 12%        | 568    | 561    | 228    | 120    | nr     |\n\n## Related risk: Supply chain sustainability compliance\n\n| Risk and/or opportunity description  and potential financial impact             | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Potential breach of compliance on  sustainability, human rights or anti-        | \u00b7  IAG GBS procedures above as well as integrity, sanctions and IAG Know Your                                                                        |\n|                                                                                 | Counterparty due diligence for higher-risk third parties                                                                                             |\n| bribery by an IAG supplier resulting in                                         | \u00b7  Internal governance on supplier management to identify challenges and mitigation                                                                  |\n| financial penalties, legal, environmental,  social and/or reputational impacts. | \u00b7  Supplier screening using external business intelligence databases which actively monitor  supplier status and flag risks including sustainability |",

Ethics and integrity governance\n\n## Relevant standards: GRI 102-16/-17, 205-1/-2/-3 Overview\n\nAll directors and employees are expected to act with integrity and in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they operate.\n\nIAG's Code of Conduct, last revised in 2019 and approved by the Board, sets out the general guidelines that govern the conduct of all directors and employees of the Group when performing their duties in their business and professional relationships. IAG does not use Company funds or resources to support any political party or candidate. Mandatory Code of Conduct training and communications activities are carried out for directors, employees and third parties on a regular basis to maintain awareness and understanding of the principles that govern the conduct of the Group. This document is available on the IAG website.\n\nIn 2023, a new Group Head of Ethics and Compliance was appointed, with the overall responsibility for developing, maintaining and overseeing the implementation of the enterprise-wide IAG compliance programme, which includes the harmonisation of the programme across the different operating companies and supporting an overarching ethics and compliance culture.\n\nIAG has in place a Group-wide Whistleblowing Policy and a consolidated whistleblowing channel provided by an independent third-party provider, Navex, where concerns can be raised on an anonymous and confidential basis. This channel is available to members of staff as well as suppliers, with information on how to access it published in IAG's Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. If any employee has a concern about unethical behaviour or organisational integrity, they are encouraged to first speak with their manager or a member of the Legal, Compliance or Human Resource teams. Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to contact their primary contact within the business. Regardless, the whistleblowing channel is available for everyone who wishes to report a concern.\n\nIAG will not tolerate any retaliation against individuals using the whistleblowing channel or contributing to investigations arising from reports to the whistleblowing channel. Whistleblowing reports received for each operating company are triaged by the Compliance teams to direct to the most appropriate area for investigation, maintaining independence in this investigation process.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the external whistleblowing channel and internal relevant reporting channels on an annual basis. This annual review considers the volume of reports by category; timeliness of follow-up; process and responsibility for follow-up; emerging themes and lessons; and any issues raised of significance to the financial statements or reputation of the Group or other areas of compliance.\n\nIn 2023, whistleblowing reports concerned issues relating to employment matters (61%), dishonest behaviour/reputation (34%), health and safety (3%) and regulatory matters (2%). All reports were followed up and investigated where appropriate and measures were implemented where concerns were identified.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering\n\nIAG and its operating companies do not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. This is made clear in the Group Code of Conduct and supporting policies which are available to all directors and employees. An anti-bribery policy statement is also set out in the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIAG has in place a Group-wide antibribery and corruption policy. This document sets out the minimum standards that are expected by the Group, its directors and employees, including definitions and guidance for bribery, gifts and hospitality guidance, political and charitable donations, public officials, facilitation payments amongst others.\n\nEach Group operating company has a Compliance Department, responsible for managing the anti-bribery programme in its business. The compliance teams from\n\nacross the Group meet regularly through Working Groups and Steering Groups, under the coordination of IAG's Group Head of Ethics and Compliance. They conduct an annual review of bribery risks at operating company and Group level.\n\nThe main compliance risks identified for 2023 were unchanged from the previous year and relate to the use of third parties, operational and commercial decisions involving government agencies, and the inappropriate use of gifts and hospitality. No material compliance breaches were identified in 2023, as in 2022. Anti-bribery and corruption training is mandatory for all relevant personnel in IAG operating companies and Group functions. Individual training requirements are set by each operating company and function and are determined by factors such as the level and responsibilities of an employee. A Group-wide anti-bribery e-learning module was rolled out in 2019 and is required to be completed every three years.\n\nTo identify, manage and mitigate potential bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses risk-based third-party due diligence which includes screenings, external reports, interviews and site visits depending on the level of risk that a third party presents. Any risks identified during the due diligence process are analysed and a mitigation plan put in place as necessary. Certain risks could result in termination of the proposed or existing relationship with the counterparty. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee receives an annual update on the anti-bribery compliance programme.\n\nThere were no legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Group and its operating companies in 2023, as in 2022, and management is not aware of any impending cases or underlying issues.\n\nIAG has processes and procedures in place across the Group, such as supplier vetting and management, Know Your Counterparty procedures and financial policies and controls, which help to combat money laundering and other compliance risks across the business.\n\n|                                              | vly   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees completing anti-bribery e-learning | 76%   | 8,574  | 4,880  | 1,404  | 1,984  | 7,933  |\n| Speak Up (whistleblower) reports             | 29%   | 324    | 252    | 164    | 193    | nr     |",

Overview\n\nSustainable aviation risks and People, culture and employee relations risks are reported as principal risks to IAG.\n\nThese risks are considered and assessed under the Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework which is presented bi-annually to the Audit and Compliance Committee and annually to the SECR Committee and Board. More details on this framework, risk identification and assessment, and risk management can be found in the Risk management and principal risk factors section.\n\nAll principal risks are linked to the Group strategic priorities which include sustainability.\n\nSustainability risks and opportunities, including climate-related risks and opportunities, are also identified and assessed by the Group Sustainability team, in conjunction with the Group ERM team, and presented to the IAG CPCASO, IAG Management Committee and SECR Committee. Plans to mitigate risks are developed by relevant risk owners in specific areas of the business, with agreed initiatives included in relevant operating company business plans. Where risk treatments require time to implement, short-term mitigations are assessed and the timeline to risk mitigation and consequent risk acceptance discussed and agreed by stakeholders.\n\nPeople, culture and employee relations risks are managed by the Group's\n\noperating companies with guidance from the Group as appropriate.\n\n## Impact on operations and strategy\n\nSustainability risk assessments have informed specific decisions related to business operations and strategy, and IAG allocates significant resources to environmental risk management.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- \u00b7  In 2019, IAG designed and adopted the industry leading Flightpath Net Zero strategy in response to the need for more ambitious action on climate change. The Group maintains its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, and continues to invest to meet that strategy;\n- \u00b7  In 2021, IAG set a new net zero target by 2050 for Scope 3 emissions and IAG GBS appointed EcoVadis to help to track supplier sustainability performance and mitigate supply chain-related sustainability risks;\n- \u00b7  In 2022, IAG expanded its commitment to invest in SAF development, production and supply, to manage climate policy risks and take advantage of energy-related opportunities; and\n- \u00b7  As of 31 December 2023, IAG investment in SAF production and supply increased further to $1 billion, of which 86% is future commitments, as we continue to scale up the use of SAF in our operations. This price is based on an assumed jet fuel price of $800 per metric tonne and contracted margins for SAF production.\n\nIAG is committed to mitigating the impacts of hazards which, if they occur,\n\n## Related risk: Environmental regulation compliance\n\n| Risk description and potential financial impacts                                    | Mitigating actions                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| An inadvertent breach of compliance  requirements related to ESG reporting,         | \u00b7  Strengthening sustainability governance including reviews of annual disclosures via  the Audit and Compliance Committee |\n| emissions or waste management, or other  environmental issues, leading to fines and | \u00b7  Internal governance, training and assigning ownership for environmental compliance  obligations                         |\n| potential reputational damage.                                                      | \u00b7  Maintaining IEnvA accreditation to improve internal compliance processes                                                |\n\nhave uncertain but potentially negative outcomes on the environment or people.\n\nIAG adopts precautionary measures to mitigate these hazards, an approach known as the precautionary principle. For example, the precautionary principle is applied to the planning of operations and the development and launch of new services IAG integrates climate considerations into three-year business plans and one-year financial forecasts and aligning activities with the Flightpath Net Zero strategy.\n\nIAG also manages risks via the use of ISO-14001-aligned environmental management systems. IEnvA is the airline industry version of ISO 14001, the international standard for environmental management systems. IEnvA is tailored specifically for airlines and is fully compatible with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThe Group's airlines completed the certification process for the IEnvA standard in 2023, except for Vueling which achieved Stage 2 certification in 2022. Following this exercise, both British Airways and Aer Lingus were awarded Stage 2 certification in 2023. Iberia was awarded Stage 2 certification in January 2024. Please refer to section A.2.3. 'Environmental Management' for more details.\n\nIn terms of the amount of provisions and warranties for environmental risks, IAG and its operating companies does not currently take out any specific insurance to cover environmental risks.",

Reporting and data governance\n\nThe full contents of this sustainability report are included in the IAG NonFinancial and Sustainability Information Statement (NFIS), which is third-party independently verified to limited assurance standards in line with ISAE3000 (Revised) 1 standards. IAG is working towards reasonable assurance by 2026. Compliance with specific frameworks and standards is listed under relevant section headings.\n\nIAG complies with current and emerging standards on sustainability reporting.\n\nThese include obligations under EU Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting and its transposition in the UK and Spain, the 2018 UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation, the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\n\nIAG aligns with selected GRI standards based on compliance with Spanish Law 11/2018. In cases where GRI alignment was not possible, other standards aligned to airline industry guidance or internal frameworks were used and described.\n\nEmissions data from intra-European flights is also independently verified within six months of the year end, for compliance with the UK and EU ETS, and for all flights for the UN CORSIA scheme. Any material changes to key metrics are highlighted in future Annual Reports.\n\nIAG also goes beyond compliance requirements and voluntarily aligns sustainability reporting with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the IATA Airlines Reporting Handbook, GRI Standards for material issues, and relevant criteria from external ESG rating agencies. IAG supported IATA and the GRI to develop the IATA handbook.\n\nThe scope of environment performance data in this report includes all IAG airlines, subsidiaries and cargo operations over which IAG has operational control. This is also the scope of the net zero targets. Some exceptions for non-material business units have been applied for specific metrics, and these are clearly stated with rationale provided.\n\nThe scope of workforce and ethics and integrity data includes all IAG operating companies and support functions. Some exceptions have been applied and these are clearly stated with rationale provided.\n\nThe scope of human rights and modern slavery reporting is as above and includes data from all suppliers in the IAG supply chain.\n\nFor any specific cases where full-year data was not available for selected metrics, estimates have been applied based on business forecasts and data from prior months.

This sets out a comprehensive risk management process and methodology to ensure a robust identification and assessment of the risks facing the Group, including emerging risks. The risk management framework is embedded across all of the Group's businesses. Enterprise risks are defined as any risk that could impact the three-year strategic business plan ('the plan'). They are assessed and if the impact is above a threshold, plotted on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nan enterprise risk heat map, based on probability and impact. Consideration is given to changes in the speed of potential impact and how principal risks influence other principal risks to help assess where key mitigations can have a greater effect on reducing overall risk to the business. Risks are also considered in combining events where a number of risks could occur together. This process is led across the Group by the IAG Management Committee supported by the ERM function.\n\nAlthough the Group considers enterprise risks that could impact the plan (defined as the short term), it also considers potential risks that could impact over the medium term of up to five years and in the longer term, beyond five years.\n\nRisk outcomes are quantified as the potential cash impact to the plan over three years. Non-cash outcomes that could impact our customers, employees, reputation, sustainability targets or our regulatory obligations are considered for every risk.\n\nKey controls and mitigations are documented, including appropriate response plans. Where risk treatments require time to implement, short-term mitigations are assessed and the timeline to risk mitigation and consequent risk acceptance discussed and agreed.\n\nEvery principal risk has clear Management Committee oversight at the Group level and in each business.",

        "page_content": "## Risk appetite\n\nIAG has a risk appetite framework which includes statements informing the business, either qualitatively or quantitatively, of the Board's appetite for certain risks. Each risk appetite statement applies either on a Groupwide basis or for specific programmes, initiatives or activity within the Group.\n\nIn the second half of 2022, the Board assessed its appetite across a number of critical strategic priorities to set tolerances for the Group for 2023. This approach allows tolerances to be set more dynamically across the plan period and aligns to the Group strategy as approved by the Board, which set the level of ambition and investment across the plan period. The exercise allowed the Board to discuss and consider the trade-offs within the plan and ensure that it was satisfied that management had set the appropriate prioritisation of initiatives to seek opportunities and manage risk within its defined appetite tolerances. This framework and tolerances have been in place throughout the year, with the Board assessing its appetite across all of the framework statements at year end against the Group's performance and its anticipated delivery of the Boardapproved strategic business plan priorities and initiatives.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the Group continued to perform and deliver initiatives throughout 2023 as planned to mitigate risk as set out in its framework statements and where further action has been required, the Board has considered potential mitigations and, where appropriate or feasible, the Group has implemented or confirmed plans that would address those risks or retain them within the Board's determined Group risk appetite.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, following the Board strategy review, the Board re-assessed its appetite for key risk areas, taking account of changes in the risk landscape since the prior year exercise, for the upcoming plan period.\n\nRegular re-assessment and confirmation of the risk appetite of the Board ensures its relevance and ongoing alignment to the Group strategic priorities and allows the Group to take appropriate risks to deliver the plan.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nWhere emerging risks and longer-term threats that the Group or the industry could face are identified, they are managed within the overall risk framework as 'on watch' until they are re-assessed to be no longer a potential threat to the business or where an assessment of the risk impact over the plan period can be made, and appropriate mitigations can be put in place or the risk becomes a principal risk. Other high-impact, low-likelihood risks are also considered.\n\n## Agility in risk management\n\nThe Group's ERM framework continues to adapt and evolve to the needs of the business and our stakeholders. This allows the Group and its businesses to both respond to changes in the external risk environment and support the pace and scale of business transformation, recognising the Board's appetite for risk.\n\nDuring the year, management across the Group have reviewed the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape to identify emerging risks and implications for existing principal risks as\n\nwell as competition and market risk changes, particularly those that could impact operational resilience, our sustainability ambitions or the Group's transformation, innovation and change agenda. By continuing to develop the Group's assessment of the interdependencies of risks, using scenarios to quantify risk impact under different combinations and assumptions, and considering the risks within the Group's risk environment that have increased or changed in their nature, either as a result of external factors or decisions within the Group's businesses, its Board and management are better informed and can react more quickly.\n\nNew guidance from regulators and investors is reviewed on an ongoing basis and best practice sought from other risk management sources.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe Board's assessment of the viability of the Group is directly informed by the outputs of the ERM framework. Full details of our approach, scenarios modelled and the viability assessment are shown at the end of this report.\n\nThe IAG Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate, robust and effective risk management framework.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For transformational risks, business owners are assigned, and the business will agree appropriate mitigations and timelines for implementation, following discussions with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nEmerging risks are assessed and risk owners consider and identify any potential impact to plans. Longer-term 'on watch' risks are subject to review as part of the framework.\n\nManagement is responsible for the effective operation of the internal controls and execution of the agreed risk mitigation plans.\n\n## Operating companies' management committees\n\nRisk heat maps for each operating company and central functions are reviewed semi-annually by their operating company's management committee or function leadership team.\n\nWhere the Group's operating companies have a reliance on other parts of the Group for services delivery, risks are reflected appropriately across risk heat maps to ensure accountability is clear.\n\nThey escalate risks that have a Group impact or require Group consideration in line with the Group ERM framework.\n\nThey confirm to their operating company board and audit committees, where they exist, as to the identification, quantification and management of risks within their operating company at least annually.\n\nLocal risk heat maps are in place for subsidiary businesses, together with Group support platforms including Group Procurement and Services and IAG Tech.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management function\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management function provides support across the Group to ensure risk management processes are appropriately embedded and applied consistently, as well as working with management to identify risk, challenge assessments and strengthen the risk culture across the\n\n## IAG Management Committee\n\nThe IAG Management Committee reviews risks during the year, including the Group risk heat map semiannually in advance of reviews by the Audit and Compliance Committee, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Spanish Good Governance Code for Listed Companies.\n\nAt the year end, the IAG Management Committee reviews the performance of the Group during the full year against the risk appetite framework and reports any near tolerance or out of tolerance assessments to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe IAG Management Committee recommends severe but plausible scenarios for stressing the strategic business plan as part of the annual Group viability assessment.\n\nGroup. The function provides risk management guidance and shares best practice across the Group and its operating companies, keeping them informed of any risk-related regulatory developments. The function is responsible for ensuring that the ERM framework remains agile and responsive to meet the needs of the business and its stakeholders.\n\nThe ERM function works with other compliance and Group functions, such as Group Finance, Government Affairs, Investor Relations, Legal, Ethics and Compliance, and Sustainability, leveraging their frameworks and assessments where appropriate. Risk assessments form an important input into the Internal Audit planning and delivery process.\n\n## IAG Board and Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nThe IAG Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate, robust and effective risk management framework, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee discusses risk and considers the risk environment regularly throughout the year, as does the IAG Board as part of wider Board discussions, in addition to the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee's bi-annual risk heat map review, including a review of the assessment of the Group's performance against its risk appetite for the financial year, scenarios for assessment of viability and the outputs from the viability modelling. The Audit and Compliance Committee has early sight of management consideration of viability scenarios to enable it to challenge subjectivities and confirm rationale. It then reviews the outputs at year end and makes recommendations on the viability assessment and statement to the Board.\n\nThe IAG Board reviews the Group's risk heatmap annually and it has completed a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks in the year.\n\nThe IAG Board sets risk appetite for the plan period.",

One risk has been reconsidered as part of the reviews and has been reframed as 'Transformation, innovation and AI' from 'Transformation and change' to recognise how the Group's change agenda is underpinned by investment which will leverage innovation and AI tools to accelerate the delivery of customer-centric, efficient processes and tools to run our businesses.\n\nThe risk around 'Critical third parties in the supply chain' is now assessed under Business and Operational risk given the nature of the potential impacts facing the Group (having previously been categorised as a Strategic risk).\n\n## Principal risk radar\n\nThe relative level of influence each principal risk has on the other principal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key for principal risk factors table\n\n## Principal risk number\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic imperatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrengthening our core\n\nDriving earnings growth through asset-light businesses\n\nOperating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework\n\nRisk\n\ntrend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShareholder, lenders and other financial stakeholders\n\n## Stakeholder impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\nEmployees\n\nSuppliers\n\nGovernments and regulators\n\nIncrease\n\nStable\n\nDecrease\n\nThe assessed likelihood of risk materialisation for each principal risk",

The Group airlines' brands are, and will continue to be, vulnerable to adverse publicity regarding events impacting service and operations. Operational resilience and customer satisfaction underpin customer trust. Reliability, including on-time performance (OTP), service and product delivery, are key elements of brand value and of each customer's experience. Investment in cabin and service propositions helps ensure that our customers choose to fly with the Group's airlines.\n\nThe Group continues to improve its disruption management capabilities given the extent of the external disruption due to ATC and third-party resilience issues, particularly over engine reliability. IAG remains focused on strengthening its customer-centricity and all of the Group's airlines continue to support their customers through any disruption including schedule adaptions where required. The Group continues to ensure that its operating companies continue to adapt and focus their business models, products and customer propositions to meet changing customer expectations and needs (including those with additional needs). Customer sentiment to travel and their expectations when they travel are intrinsic to brand health. The resilience and engagement of our people as customer service ambassadors to deliver excellent customer service is critical to retaining brand and customer trust.",

The Group is closely reviewing the impacts of wage and supplier inflation on margins and customer demand.\n\nThe re-opening of China at the beginning 2023 and removal of remaining restrictions in countries, post the pandemic, has simplified operations and the customer experience at airports. However ongoing conflicts, wars and heightened tensions across the Middle East further increase airspace restrictions and congestion for flows to Asia.\n\nWider macroeconomic trends are being monitored such as a potential economic recession and tone of dialogue between the US, Russia, China and the EU and UK which can influence markets and result in imposition of misaligned policies or tariffs. The trend of increased nationalism and the potential impact to the Group is also kept under review. Recent supply chain disruptions have occurred in many markets and the level of disruption and potential impacts are considered across the Group. The Group also considers changes in government in key markets and the implications for trade, respective economic health and how governments view the aviation industry, with elections expected in the UK, Ireland and the US over the next year.\n\nDevelopments in relevant international relationships, where they affect air services agreements to which the EU or UK are party, are monitored throughout the year and the Group's positions advocated with the relevant national governments. Recent government proposals to set floor or ceiling caps on pricing, including the scope of ancillaries that airlines may be allowed to charge their customers for, may impact the ability to freely set pricing, sell ancillaries to meet customer needs and/or set capacity.\n\nIAG has worked through trade associations, IATA, as well as national governments to put its case on issues of the importance of aviation to international trade and customer connectivity and the value that it brings.\n\nAny further macroeconomic trends or potential requirements arising from Brexit are monitored by the IAG Government Affairs function.",

The Procurement function will have a key role to play in ensuring its delivery of the Scope 3 commitment for the Group with supplier sustainability ratings and sustainability clauses in supplier contracts key considerations for future contract negotiations and renewals. IAG has also committed to 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage on average across its fleet by 2030.\n\nPlans implemented by the EU, UK and US governments to decarbonise aviation have resulted in fragmentation of policy measures and support offered by governments for green initiatives across the different regions in which the Group airlines operate. SAF infrastructure and availability lags demand, impacting the ability to achieve the aviation industry's carbon reduction commitments. Mandates and other tax-based measures may disproportionately impact the Group's airlines versus their competitors. All of the Group's airlines have agreed new deals for the production of SAF to meet the Group's target on the path to decarbonisation. Overall aviation industry requirements will require infrastructure investments across markets to support the production of SAF to meet demand expectations.\n\nThe Group continues to model potential impacts and costs, which includes the removal of aviation jet fuel tax exemption, with mitigation plans embedded into strategic and financial planning.\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines for climate-related scenario analysis and climate-specific risk assessments. The Group continues with its assessment of climate-related risks, by testing and revising the assumptions on updated forecasts for future business growth and the regulatory context and future carbon pricing. The Group has also embedded forecasting of its climate impacts into its strategic, business and financial planning processes and has assessed that it is resilient to material climate-related impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Stakeholder   | Strategic   | Risk trend   | Risk trend   | Viability   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| impact        | imperatives | 2023         | 2022         | scenarios   |\n|               |             |              |              | 1 2 4       |",

In August, a failure of UK national ATC services impacted flight operations across the UK.\n\nThe Group proactively assesses its schedules for operability and continues to work with all critical suppliers to understand any potential disruption within their supply chains from either a shortage of available resource, strike action or production delays which could impact the availability of new fleet, engines or critical goods or services. Delays in new aircraft and spare engines, and technical performance issues requiring additional maintenance continue to impact operations and turnaround times for aircraft. This has led to increased costs to secure such services. Focus has been placed on key suppliers given the inflationary environment impacting wages and costs of goods, to understand any business or operational continuity impacts, and where possible identify other suitable suppliers. The Group has been impacted by reliability and performance of GTF engines, which is mitigated with replacement aircraft and remedy support from the engine manufacturer.\n\nMany elements of the supply chain remain outside of the Group's ability to directly manage, including aircraft deliveries and availability of components, airport performance and ATC resilience.\n\nThe Group continues to consult stakeholders and raise awareness of the negative impacts of ATC airspace restrictions and performance issues on the aviation sector and economies across Europe, particularly with the capacity recovery and continued closure of airspace driven by geopolitical events. The Group relies on the provision of airport infrastructure and is dependent on the timely delivery of appropriate facilities. The Group continues to challenge unreasonable levels of increases in airport charges, especially at London Heathrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Stakeholder   | Strategic   | Risk trend   | Risk trend   | Viability   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| impact        | imperatives | 2023         | 2022         | scenarios   |\n|               |             |              |              | 2           |",

The Group continues to improve its cybersecurity posture either through major IT transformational change or additional monitoring through tools.\n\nIn the first half of the year, some of the Group's businesses were impacted by an attack on a third-party services provider holding employee data. The Group is focused on improving its cybersecurity posture and better understanding the risk presented by its suppliers.\n\nThe regulatory regimes associated with data and infrastructure security are also becoming more complex with different regulators applying different framework approaches and guidance for reporting. The Group airlines are subject to the requirements of privacy legislation such as GDPR and the National Information Security Directive (NISD).\n\nThe emergence and usage of AI to bypass cybersecurity controls, produce phishing emails and malware has also accelerated attempts to access organisations' systems and data and increases the threat and scale of social engineering attacks.\n\nInvestment in cybersecurity systems and controls continues as planned, although addressing the risk is also dependent on business capacity and the delivery of solutions to address technical obsolescence within IAG Tech. All planned investment is linked to a Group-wide maturity assessment based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, a leading industry standard benchmark. Data centre migration activity to the cloud across the Group's airlines will further help to improve the security controls environment.

Ongoing labour shortages, particularly for technical licensed staff, industrial unrest and strike action in the aviation sector combined with goods availability shortages in the supply chain, especially engines, and airspace and ATC restrictions can all impact the operational environment and the customer experience of the Group's airlines and increase the costs of running operations to provide additional resilience, as well as impacting the costs and operations of the businesses on which the Group relies.\n\nThe Group continues with its ambitious IT infrastructure transformation agenda to modernise and digitalise its IT estates. The Group is focused on minimising any unplanned outages or disruption to customers with additional resilience built into the airlines' networks.\n\nThe Group continues to consider and build its resilience to withstand severe unexpected stresses. Potential high-impact, low-likelihood events have been considered that could have the potential to disrupt IAG and/or the aviation sector. Many of these events remain outside the Group's control such as adverse weather, another pandemic, civil unrest or a terrorist event seen in cities served by the Group's airlines.",

IAG relies on the successful agreement of collective bargaining arrangements across its operating companies to operate its airlines.\n- \u00b7  The right skillsets and culture are needed to transform our businesses at pace.\n- \u00b7  The Group's airlines require specialist skillsets to continue to operate.\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Mitigations\n\n- \u00b7  Any breakdowns in the bargaining process with the unionised workforces may result in subsequent strike action which may disrupt operations and adversely affect business performance and customer perceptions of the airlines.\n- \u00b7  Our people are not engaged, or they do not display the required leadership or cultural behaviours.\n- \u00b7  The Group businesses fail to attract, motivate, retain or develop our people to deliver service and brand experience.\n- \u00b7  Critical skillsets are not in place to execute on the required transformation plan or to exploit innovation and AI opportunities and drive the business forward.\n- \u00b7  Technical licensed staff, including pilots and engineers, may be impacted by Brexit recruitment restrictions.\n\n- \u00b7  Ongoing information sharing, consultation and collective bargaining with unions across the Group take place on a regular basis led by operating companies' human resources specialists, who have a strong skillset in industrial relations.\n- \u00b7  Ensuring that remuneration is aligned to local markets in terms of productivity and pay.\n- \u00b7  Operating companies' people strategies are in place in our businesses.\n- \u00b7  Succession planning within and across operating companies has been reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and Board and a consistent process is being implemented across the Group.\n- \u00b7  Focus on recruiting and developing skills to run and transform our business.\n- \u00b7  The Group is investing in apprentice programmes and retention initiatives to help secure and retain engineers.\n- \u00b7  Operating companies' engagement and organisational health surveys have been conducted with subsequent action plans developed to create a positive and inclusive culture.\n- \u00b7  Access to support individuals' wellbeing.\n- \u00b7  IAG Code of Conduct is supported by annual awareness programmes and mandatory training for all of our staff.\n\nOur people, their engagement, cultural appetite and mindset for change are critical to the Group's current performance and future success. Our leadership recognises the efforts of our staff and their commitment through the continued operational challenges facing our airlines. Resource shortages in crew have been addressed and our businesses are building the knowledge and experience of their new starters and managing the cultural impacts of onboarding at scale to ensure they have the right capabilities to operate. Shortages in technical licensed staff across the aviation sector and in the Group airlines may impact maintenance delivery timelines unless resource levels can be secured.\n\nAcross the Group, collective bargaining is in place with various unions. Where agreements are open, our operating companies continue to engage in discussions with unions to secure sustainable agreements and address concerns arising within the negotiations. In September, AENA announced the result of its competitive tender for ground handling licences at airports across Spain, which resulted in the loss of key airports to another provider, with unions for Iberia ground handling services taking strike action in January 2024. Iberia plans to create a new handling company, which will provide handling services and all airport staff affected by the AENA decision will be moved to the new company, with a new sector CBA and conditions for existing Iberia employees.\n\nThe Group is focused on staff wellbeing and people morale and motivation, including supporting agile and hybrid working models. Welfare support schemes are in place to support the Group's staff, and initiatives to build trust and engagement continue across the Group's businesses. The Group has identified the skills and capabilities that are required to manage its transformation, which include enhancing its leadership capability and delivering on the Group's diversity and inclusion plans. All operating companies recognise the critical role that their employees will play in the transformation and future success of the Group and they are focusing on improving organisational health and employee engagement.\n\nStakeholder\n\nimpact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic\n\nimperatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk trend\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These trends may require the business to consider strategic responses, business model adaptions and new skillsets ahead of any potential impact to the Group plan.\n\nOther considerations include:\n\n- \u00b7  economic trends and shifts in the relative strengths of global economies including rise of emerging markets and hubs, market shifts and interconnectivity including partnerships and alliances, the competitive landscape and changes in customer mix or sentiment to travel;\n- \u00b7  supply chains and proximity and reliability of supply, inflationary, resource and availability pressures on key suppliers;\n- \u00b7  costs of compliance to environmental and climate change regulations and/or lack of availability of infrastructure within countries to meet commitments or government mandates;\n- \u00b7  increasing regulatory burdens, asymmetry in policy and/or government intervention impacting aviation and the Group's business model;\n- \u00b7  areas of risk or opportunity for the Group, such as workforce availability, migration, war for talent, impact of AI on business and skillsets, outcomes of mis- and dis-information, diversity and inclusion ambitions, hybrid ways of working and different career expectations from new joiners into workforces and the aviation industry;\n- \u00b7  structural changes in how customers travel;\n- \u00b7  the potential macroeconomic consequences of interest rates and inflation especially where there are labour shortages in key markets or a shortage of technical specialists;\n- \u00b7  the potential longer-term impacts of Brexit and the UK's divergence from EU policy and laws;\n- \u00b7  the Group's resilience to future events impacting aviation or global markets, financial markets, interest rates and exchange rates, particularly the US dollar; and\n- \u00b7  stakeholder expectations over commitment to acting with integrity to protect our planet, particularly climate change and carbon impacts.\n\nThe directors have assessed key threats and trends faced by the industry, emerging risks and opportunities, as well as other industry and Group-specific risks that could impact the Group's business plan:\n\n- \u00b7  these are considered in light of their impact on our business model and relevance, operations, customers and financial status and include changes in regulations, customer trends and behaviours, macroeconomic predictions on growth, regional market opportunities, technology trends, environmental implications and infrastructure developments that could impact our operations, as well as more existential threats to aviation;\n- \u00b7  when developing the Group's threeyear business plan, longer-term considerations have been assessed by the IAG Management Committee and the Board in conjunction with the priorities of and risks faced by the business; and\n- \u00b7  the Board has also conducted its annual strategy session in addition to regular performance and strategy delivery progress reviews during the year. Following this process, short-, medium- and longer-term priorities, challenges and opportunities have been identified and actions agreed.\n\nThe directors have assessed key threats and trends, and emerging risks and opportunities, to determine plausible but severe downside scenarios that could impact the Group's three-year business plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Viability scenario process\n\nWhen considering the viability of the Group, for the purposes of this report, the directors have evaluated the risk landscape facing the Group and recommended plausible but severe downside scenarios that could impact the Group's three-year plan to determine the Group's resilience to such impacts.\n\nThe results of these scenarios on the plan have been presented both pre and post an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available over this period (and not already reflected in the plan).",

        "page_content": "## Scenarios modelled\n\nThe scenarios have been defined by management and designed to consider principal risks (or combinations of risks) that could materialise over the viability period and weaken the Group's liquidity position, and therefore its financial sustainability. Each scenario is regarded as severe but also plausible and has considered the impact on liquidity, solvency and the ability to raise financing in an uncertain and volatile environment.\n\nNo. Title\n\n## 1 Downside case\n\nThis scenario configures a blend of commercial and operational adverse impacts which would result in capacity reductions, in addition to an increase in fuel prices, over and above the Group's business plan assumptions.\n\nEconomic considerations include a combination of events reducing capacity up to a maximum of 25%, increasing fuel prices up to 20%, reducing passenger unit revenue and increased operational costs.\n\nThe Downside case assumes that British Airways would be required to draw down, in full, its portion of the available US dollar Revolving Credit Facility. The Downside case also builds in a downside impact in Air Europa Holdings, which the Group plans to acquire in the plan period, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe period to June 2025 of this Downside case has also been applied as the Downside case in the going concern analysis (see note 2 of the Group financial statements).\n\n## 2 Operational resilience challenges\n\nLost revenue within some IAG airlines from pre-emptive flight cancellations in response to resourcing challenges with resultant reputational impact.\n\nOngoing challenges in the global supply chain, particularly engine availability, reliability and performance leads to an increase in grounded aircraft awaiting maintenance with further capacity reductions also impacting revenues. Revenues from the Group's maintenance business also impacted by the lack of available spare parts.\n\nFurther revenue impact considered from reduced capacity as a result of airport capacity and air traffic control airspace restrictions.\n\nRevenue impact from schedule disruption due to extreme weather events also considered within the scenario.\n\n## 3 Cybersecurity and IT infrastructure\n\nA stress to model the impact of a ransomware attack on an IAG airline. The scenario assumes a disruption period of five days resulting from the attack before full connectivity is restored, impacting customers and operations of the affected airline. It also assumes lost revenue due to disruption of operations at the affected airline with knock-on impacts to other IAG airlines due to the need to isolate and switch off connectivity of Group shared credentials platforms. There are also further lost revenues due to reputational impact and increased EU 261 and other customer goodwill costs. Associated costs of recovery from the incident include the disruption through the investigation period including increased IT costs as well as brand impacts, and the potential for regulatory scrutiny and fines.\n\nIn addition, the scenario considers an unplanned outage owing to data centre migration activity resulting in short notice flight cancellations causing further lost revenue and increased EU 261 and other customer goodwill costs.\n\n## 4 Sustainability and business transformation\n\nAn increasing revenue stress on short-haul operations across the Group to reflect changes in customer behaviours towards short-haul travel where other travel options exist.\n\nIncreased carbon costs and sustainable fuel costs to meet mandates and where supply cannot be secured. Revenues in key markets below plan expectations also modelled to reflect a potential long-term change in mix and travel behaviours.\n\nPotential for lost revenue impact arising from delays in delivering and realising the benefits of business transformation initiatives and increased costs of securing required resourcing levels.\n\nLonger-term consideration of the impacts of climate change and carbon and regulatory initiatives to address this within the aviation sector, such as the implementation of new regulatory policy, carbon costs and the cost and availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel are also subject to assessment and modelling by the Group in addition to the viability scenario assessments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nViability scenario includes\n\nsustainability-related stress\n\nManagement has also assessed mitigations that are available to the business beyond operating cost reductions including further financing, capital expenditure plans and potential disposals. Options are presented, as appropriate, for the Board to assess. In reviewing and approving the scenarios, the Board considered, amongst other matters, the availability and sufficiency of potential mitigations, the expected speed of implementation in response to the uncertainty and the future flexibility required for the Group to adapt further as needed.\n\nSensitivities in the scenarios' assumptions have been highlighted by management and challenged by the Board. In addition, the Board reviewed the results of revenue and margin reverse stress tests, which demonstrated the level of sustained passenger revenue decline, and, separately, margin decline before mitigations, that would result in the Group using all available liquidity (including cash and currently available undrawn credit facilities) and compared this to the outputs from the scenarios.\n\nLink to\n\nprincipal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1, 6, 7, 8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the viability of the Group over three years to December 2026. They have considered the global macroeconomic environment and geopolitical uncertainty, the health of the aviation industry and its supply chain, the assumptions of the plan, the strategy of the Group and the Board's risk appetite. Although the prospects of the Group are considered over a longer period, the directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate timeframe for assessment as it is aligned with the Group's strategic planning period (as reflected in the plan), and as the external uncertainties facing the aviation sector continue to be significant and many are beyond the Group's ability to influence directly.\n\nThe Board recognises the pace of change required within the Group to further adapt, build appropriate resilience and respond to this environment, in addition to the rapidly changing competitive landscape and wider global macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe Group has reviewed the modelling of the impact of mitigating actions to offset further deterioration in demand and capacity, including reductions in operating expenditure and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nFurther details on debt financing can be found in the going concern disclosures in note 2 of the Group financial statements.\n\nBased on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they fall due and raise financing as required over the period to December 2026. However, this is subject to a number of significant factors that are outside the control of the Group. In reaching this assessment the directors have made assumptions when considering both the plan and the Downside case (the most severe and plausible of the viability scenarios considered):\n\n- \u00b7  the Group will continue to have access to funding options and that the capital markets retain a level of stability and appetite for funding within the aviation sector;\n- \u00b7  the Group can implement any further structural changes required in agreement with any union consultation processes and regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7  any future pandemic or other public health-related restrictions do not result in further prolonged and substantial capacity reductions and groundings as governments do not have the appetite for the economic impact and stress that it would place on their respective economies and populations;\n- \u00b7  any new virus strain or threat to public health that emerges during the viability period can be managed within existing health and testing regimes without recourse to government regulations that significantly affect our airlines' operations; and\n- \u00b7  geopolitical events do not result in significant war zones impacting financial markets, airspace operations and connectivity flows across our flight schedules.",

With a long-term vision and a focus on the sustainability of our business, the Board has accompanied the management team on this journey, primarily supporting but also challenging them where necessary.\n\nWe are also proud of the progress made on sustainability. Our focus is supported by the work of the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, which has been valuable in providing insight into stakeholders' interests and oversight of the important sustainability and corporate responsibility work being carried out by our management team, ensuring that we are best placed to achieve our environmental and social ambitions.\n\nThe work of this and the other Board committees in 2023, as set out in their individual reports, is fundamental to supporting the Group governance framework that underpins our business model.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThere were no changes to the Board composition during the year. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, considers its composition and succession planning on an ongoing basis, including identifying those skills where enhancements to current composition should be a focus for future recruitment. We are confident that our Board brings together the range of experience and knowledge necessary for it to function properly, drawing on external advice or training in areas where specific knowledge is required or where we need to strengthen and supplement the board skills. Subject to our statutory nationality requirements, we have a fairly diverse Board, in the broadest sense, including five different nationalities and solid international experience.\n\n## Management changes\n\nThere were several key Management Committee appointments during the year. Following a period of renewal over the past three years, IAG's new management team was introduced and took part in our Capital Markets Day. The refreshed leadership team is well positioned to support our Group Chief Executive in delivering our strategic priorities. These appointments are detailed in the Nominations Committee report.\n\n## Culture and diversity\n\nConnecting with our workforce throughout the year has supported the Board's ability to deliver on its key objective of driving a culture in IAG that ensures alignment of our purpose and values, as well as with the Group strategy.\n\nIn 2023, we built on the comprehensive workforce engagement programme previously established and continued to meet and interact with our various teams. We recognise the time and commitment that this type of programme requires, both on our part and on the part of IAG and each operating company, but we believe that the value we derive from this engagement, both for the Board and for the management team itself, more than compensates for it. The open exchange and learnings provided by these sessions will serve to accelerate the cultural and operational transformation of the business. The workforce engagement section in this report provides further detail on programme content and positive outcomes delivered.\n\nCreating a diverse and inclusive culture continues to be a focus. We are proud of our gender representation that includes 45% female Board members, a female Senior Independent Director and three female Board advisory committee chairs. We also have one director from a ethnic minority background. Our focus and resultant Board composition ensured that we met the targets for reporting set by the UK Listings Rules and complied with the Spanish Corporate Governance Code.\n\nSuccession planning and oversight of developments under our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy will continue to be a priority. At management level, a great deal of focus and effort is being put into making progress in this area and the results are beginning to show, although there is still some way to go to achieve our ambition of 40% senior leadership roles held by women by 2025 and our newly reported ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for the Group's UK senior leadership population by the end of 2027. Beyond these aspirations, the Nominations Committee has given priority in recent years to overseeing the detailed work on equity, diversity and inclusion, which is substantial, as well as the work completed on talent development and succession programmes.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nReflecting our commitment to good governance, the Nominations Committee oversaw the evaluation of the performance of the Board and all our committees, which we conducted internally under my leadership as Chairman of the Board, supported by the Board Secretariat. The outcomes and details of the process are provided later in this report.\n\nOur robust and efficient governance processes underpin our ability to live our values and deliver our strategy. The Board is committed to ensuring that we continue to maintain high standards of corporate governance and business conduct so that we can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, taking into account the interests of all our stakeholders.\n\nOur people remain at the heart and centre of our business. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my ongoing appreciation for their efforts and commitment during this transformative year. I would also like to thank my Board colleagues for their continued support and dedication.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman",

IAG's light central structure drives portfolio and financial strategy, oversees intragroup coordination to maximise value creation, manages central functions, including the development of its common integrated platform, and facilitates the sharing of best practice, innovation and synergies of scale.\n\nEach operating company has an individual brand and cultural identity, and customised business model. Each is responsible for executing its strategy, accountable for its results and has its own board of directors and management committee, led by the top executive of each company. Matters are only executed centrally where it provides additional value and where centres of excellence have been created. While each of our airlines possess its own distinctive proposition, IAG enables them to work together towards a common goal.\n\nFurther details on the Group structure can be found in the Business Model section within the Strategic report.\n\n## Board of Directors: division of responsibilities\n\nThe IAG Board is responsible for establishing the Company's purpose, values and strategy, promoting its culture, overseeing the business and its performance, as well as for the Group's long-term sustainable success. As stated in the Board Regulations, which are available on the Company's corporate website (www.iairgroup.com), the Board endeavours to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests of the employees, suppliers, customers, and other affected stakeholders, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment. Examples of this long-term focus and consideration of stakeholders' interest are discussed further in this report and in the stakeholder engagement section.\n\nConsistent with its governance role, the Board of Directors retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision, as detailed in article 3.4 of the Board Regulations.\n\nThe Board has four advisory committees that provide dedicated focus on a number of areas. Each Board committee comprises non-executive directors only and has an experienced independent non-executive chair. Copies of the minutes of all committees' meetings as well as the documents distributed ahead of each committee meeting are made available to all Board members.\n\nThe different Board positions and their respective responsibilities are detailed in the Board Regulations. The Board has also approved separate regulations for each of the Board committees. These regulations are also available on the corporate website. The roles, membership and activities of these committees during 2023 are described in the individual reports within this Corporate Governance report.\n\nThere is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, their main responsibilities are established in articles 5 and 6 of the Board Regulations. The Chairman is responsible for the operation of the Board and for its overall effectiveness in directing the Company. The Group Chief Executive and his management team are responsible for the day-to-day management and performance of the Group and for the implementation of the strategy approved by the Board.\n\nAll the powers of the Board have been permanently delegated to the Group Chief Executive save for those which cannot be delegated pursuant to applicable legislation, the Company Bylaws, or the Board Regulations.",

The Group Chief Financial Officer, Nicholas Cadbury, and the Group General Counsel, Sarah Clements, also attend Board meetings.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board, as reported by the Nominations Committee, reviewed directors' independence at its meeting held on 18 January 2024. It is satisfied that those directors classified as independent are free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with exercising an independent judgement, both as a question of character and judgement. Further details are provided on conflicts of interest and independence of directors later in this report and in the Nominations Committee report.\n\nThe Chairman was considered independent on appointment and neither he nor any of the non-executive directors has exceeded the maximum nine-year recommended term of service set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The longest serving director, Emilio Saracho, has served on the Board since 2016.\n\n## Appointment, re-election, resignation, and removal of directors\n\nThe selection and appointment process is described in the Nominations Committee report.\n\nIAG directors are appointed for a period of one year, as set out in the Company's Bylaws. At the end of their mandate, directors may be re-elected one or more times for periods of equal duration to that established in the Bylaws. In this way, the Company complies with the UK Code recommendation that directors should be subject to annual re-election.\n\nRe-election proposals are subject to a formal process, based on a Nominations Committee proposal in the case of independent directors, or its recommendation for all other categories of directors. This proposal or recommendation is prepared having due regard to the performance, commitment, capacity, ability, and availability of the director to continue to contribute to the Board with the knowledge, skills and experience required.\n\nNotwithstanding this, a director must resign under article 17.2 of the Board Regulations, when, amongst other matters, the director ceases to have the good standing, suitability, reliability, competence, availability or commitment to office necessary to be a director of the Company or when his or her remaining on the Board might affect the Company's credibility or reputation or otherwise jeopardises its interests.\n\nAccording to article 24.2 of the Board Regulations, directors have several disclosure obligations, including the duty to inform the Company of any situation in which they are involved which may seriously affect the reputation of the Company, in particular if they are involved in any investigation in a criminal proceeding. In such circumstances, the Board would consider the case as soon as practicable and adopt the decisions it deems fit, following a report by the Nominations Committee and taking into account the corporate interest.\n\nDirectors cease to hold office when the term of office for which they were appointed expires.",

IAG continues to use its unique business model to pursue this purpose and vision, whilst delivering sustainable value for customers, its people, its shareholders and the communities it serves.\n\nBy connecting people, businesses and countries, the Group can provide the jobs, prosperity and cultural benefits that travel has always created.\n\nThe Board believes that IAG can achieve its purpose and vision by promoting the Group's common values of commitment, pragmatism, execution, ambition, resilience, and being a challenger and innovator, a team player, responsible and people-focused. The focus on corporate culture and values is an essential element in the continued transformation and execution of the Group's strategy.\n\nFurther detail on IAG's purpose and values can be found throughout this annual report, including in the People section.\n\n## Corporate culture\n\nAs a Board, we have continued to focus on culture and ways of working within the Group as we invest in both our people and the business.\n\nComplementing the Group's common values, each operating company and platform business has its own corporate culture and values which support its unique brand, business, customer, and employee propositions. All our operating companies and platform businesses remain focused on building and embedding the culture needed to enable our businesses to be competitive, achieve our transformation agenda and provide a great working environment in which all colleagues can thrive.\n\nIn 2023, the Board continued to review progress on culture, supporting management's focus on transforming IAG's culture and continuing to focus on building an inclusive, supportive, and healthy working environment. During 2023, the Board considered the outcome of the latest Organisational Health Index (OHI) survey completed by all employees in May and the follow-up pulse survey undertaken in November, including the insights from operating companies and the agreed priorities for improving culture, ways of working and shaping people strategies.\n\nFurther, through the enhanced workforce engagement activity highlighted in this report,\n\nrepresentatives of the Board have heard first hand from employees across the Group on their experience of working within IAG, the prevailing culture and areas where improvements to current practices have been suggested.\n\nAt the Board strategy meeting held in September 2023, specific focus was placed on people and culture. Individual operating company plans were also reviewed to understand the extent to which their people transformation priorities and plans supported the delivery of the operating company strategy.\n\nThe Nominations, the Remuneration and the Safety Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committees received updates on a range of workforce and people topics including talent and succession planning, inclusion and diversity, and workforce remuneration.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nGroup companies invest in their employees through training and development programmes, as well as through healthcare and wellbeing programmes. Specific conditions are set and managed within each operating company, enabling them to put in place appropriate programmes to reflect their specific operating model and local market conditions.\n\nAcross the Group we look to ensure that all rewards and benefits are simple, clear, competitive, and fair. Collective bargaining arrangements are in place for 87% of the workforce. We work closely with employee representatives to consult on reward matters. For those outside collective agreements, we benchmark roles and rewards against local markets to ensure they remain attractive and competitive.\n\nFurther information on workforce remuneration can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.",

This is in line with Recommendation 12 of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code, which is reflected in article 3.6 of our Board of Directors' Regulations.\n\nGiven the nature of our business, we understand the importance of stakeholder engagement to inform our strategy and the way in which we operate. This section describes how the directors in their deliberations and decision-making, consider the interests of stakeholders to create value and promote the long-term success of the Company. As these interests can conflict, the directors need to balance stakeholder interests with the corporate interest, including consideration of the impact of activities on the environment and communities in which we operate. During the reporting period, the directors acted in good faith, with unity of purpose and independent judgement, upholding high standards of business conduct and treating shareholders fairly.\n\nFeedback from stakeholders received by various parts of the business helps to inform decisions overseen by the Board. Where relevant, the views of stakeholders are embedded in the proposals presented to the Board for consideration or decision. In addition, the diverse set of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board members enables them to apply the appropriate level of rigorous challenge and evaluation to decisions.\n\nFurther details on how the provisions of Section 172 were considered can also be found throughout the Strategic and Corporate Governance reports. The Board of Directors' Regulations as well as the Group policy on delegation and decision making ensures that relevant matters are escalated to the Board for consideration and that information is provided to directors with sufficient time for their analysis and consideration. Directors also participate in the design of the Board plan of activities for the year, setting the priorities for the Board and including any areas of interest requested by directors.

        "page_content": "## Decision-making, reserved matters and delegation\n\nThe IAG Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive and the Group's management team but it has reserved authority for itself on several matters, including three key areas as set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  approval of the Group strategy and the supervision of its implementation, which entails the approval of the business plan, management objectives and annual financial plan, monitoring of the internal information and control systems, and of the risk management framework and processes;\n- \u00b7  approval and compliance oversight of the Group general policies including: the investment and financing policy; the enterprise risk management policy; the corporate responsibility or sustainability policy; and\n- \u00b7  according to certain quantitative thresholds, the approval of contractual commitments, asset acquisition or disposals, capital expenditures, borrowings, or equity investments.\n\nThe Group's decision-making process is regulated by an internal policy covering the IAG Board, the IAG Management Committee as well as the boards of the main subsidiaries. In addition, another policy regulates the Group's investment process. This authority framework and the support provided by the Board advisory committees underpin the effective operation of the governance system.\n\nAs indicated above, there are occasions where the Board may have to make decisions balancing the competing priorities of stakeholders. The principles set out in article 3.6 of our Board Regulations, which align with those reflected in section 172 of the UK Companies Act, are embedded throughout the Group's decision-making processes.\n\n## Stakeholders' interests\n\nDay-to-day stewardship of stakeholder relationships is delegated to management, with the Board having a supervisory role based on the information provided and discussions held with management teams. In addition to this, the Board has direct engagement with the Company's shareholders and with the workforce as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nInformation on the Board's engagement with the workforce is provided in the workforce engagement section of this Corporate Governance report.\n\nMore information on our stakeholders and our engagement with them can be found in the Stakeholder engagement section of this annual report.\n\n## Shareholders and investors\n\nShareholder interests are key in the Board's considerations. The Board maintains a direct and active dialogue with shareholders and investors mainly through the Group Chief Executive and the Group CFO, who meet with shareholders and investors on a regular basis, as well as through the Chairman, the SID or the committee chairs as appropriate. The Board is regularly apprised of shareholders' feedback and the main issues discussed with shareholders and investors.\n\nIn addition, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee held meetings with investors as detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report. Non-executive directors had the opportunity to meet shareholders at the shareholders' meeting held in June, as well as during the Capital Markets Day held in November.\n\nThis was the first time since the pandemic that IAG had hosted a Capital Markets Day. Presentations and a recording from the day are available to view on our website. Discussions were led by the Group Chief Executive, highlighting our focus on maximising shareholder returns underpinned by the four near-term strategic priorities and capital discipline together with a strong balance sheet. The event provided an opportunity for our institutional shareholders to connect with management and to obtain a deeper understanding of how our stated priorities translate to the operating companies' activities to achieve both transformation, innovation, and growth. Shareholders were able to hear from and ask questions of the Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the IAG Management Committee, including the Chief Executives of the operating companies.\n\nPositive feedback was received that focused on the new strategic insights, in particular around the Group's markets and networks, the increasing value of the Spanish businesses, as well as the attractiveness of IAG Loyalty. The information provided on financial targets was also well-received. On the other hand, analysts and investors noted that the higher level of investment would have a detrimental short-term impact on margins and free cash flow.\n\nAdditional information can be found in the Stakeholder engagement section of this annual report.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe designated directors visited our operating companies and platform businesses across IAG, to meet a variety of employees and leaders in their work context with the goal of better understanding first-hand the challenges and opportunities of the different businesses, employee issues and levels of engagement. These visits continue to be valuable in understanding what matters to colleagues across the business, from ground and flight operations to our customer support and corporate teams, and with a mix of new recruits and colleagues with long tenure reflecting the changing composition of the Group's workforce.\n\nEva Castillo is the director responsible for coordinating the workforce engagement. She has been supported during 2023 by Heather Ann McSharry, Maurice Lam, Emilio Saracho and Nicola Shaw.\n\nIn 2023, the designated directors conducted eight engagement visits, meeting colleagues across all operating companies and across our four main hubs (London, Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona).\n\nBoard members noted the progress made on transformation across all areas and the increased focus on the people agenda and in improving organisational health and culture. The Board was impressed with the high levels of pride and commitment across all sites.\n\nWhilst each visit highlighted some specific local challenges, several key themes emerged. These included: communication, investment in facilities and IT, flexible work arrangements, and supply chain challenges. Each visit included a debrief with senior teams on emerging issues to ensure appropriate actions are taken forward.\n\nFor further detail on the outcomes of broader employee engagement activities, refer to the Stakeholder engagement section of this report.",

        "page_content": "The Board considered the results from the 2023 workforce engagement programme at its December meeting. This feedback serves as valuable input for decision-making processes related to people and culture strategies and organisational transformation.\n\nIn addition to the direct engagement with employees, the Board has been regularly informed about initiatives at each operating company with respect to its workforce. A session at the annual Board strategy meeting was devoted to the Group people strategy including updates on talent, culture and diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee was updated on workforce remuneration and how the operating companies were supporting colleagues with cost-of-living challenges, ensuring reward remained fair and competitive, and how the experience of IAG's workforce compared to senior leaders. The Nominations Committee was updated on succession planning for senior leadership including an overview of recruitment, mobility and attrition of senior leaders across the Group.\n\n## Board and committee meetings\n\nThe Board met eight times during the year, including its annual two-day strategy meeting held in September 2023. Details of attendance at Board and committee meetings are shown below.\n\nThe Board Secretariat together with the Group General Counsel maintains an annual agenda schedule for Board meetings that sets out strategic, standard, and operational matters to be considered. The Chairman sets a carefully structured agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Group Chief Executive, with support from the Group General Counsel and the Board Secretariat. During 2023, the Board's main focus was to create sustainable value over the long term, supporting management and exercising oversight over the Group's businesses and stakeholders' interests. The key activities of the Board in 2023 are detailed in the Board activities table further on in this report.\n\nAt each Board meeting, the Board receives a report from each of the Chairs of the committee meetings held prior to that Board meeting. The reports focus on the key discussions and decisions considered by the respective committees, providing an opportunity\n\nfor directors to comment or ask questions on the matters dealt with by each committee and to ensure that all Board members remain apprised of committee activities. In addition, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer report to the Board on key matters in the Group.\n\nAll scheduled Board meetings include a private session for non-executive directors to meet with the Chairman to discuss any matters arising. At least once a year there is a private meeting with the Chairman that includes independent non-executive directors only. The Senior Independent Director also meets with the non-executive directors, without the Chairman, as part of the Chairman's annual evaluation process.\n\nAs stated in the Board Regulations, directors shall make their best efforts to attend Board meetings. If this is not possible, they may grant a proxy to another non-executive director specifically for that meeting. No director may hold more than three proxies, except for the Chairman, although he cannot represent more than half of the Board members. As far as possible, proxies should be granted including voting instructions.\n\n## Board and committee attendance during 2023\n\n| Board member         | Board   | Audit and Compliance  Committee   | Nominations  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Safety, Environment and Corporate  Responsibility Committee   |\n|----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n        | 8/8     |                                   | 6/6                      |                           |                                                               |\n| Luis Gallego         | 8/8     |                                   |                          |                           |                                                               |\n| Giles Agutter        | 7/8     |                                   | 6/6                      |                           | 4/4                                                           |\n| Peggy Bruzelius      | 8/8     | 7/7                               | 5/6                      |                           |                                                               |\n| Eva Castillo         | 8/8     | 7/7                               |                          | 5/5                       |                                                               |\n| Margaret Ewing       | 8/8     | 7/7                               | 6/6                      |                           |                                                               |\n| Maurice Lam          | 7/8     | 6/7                               |                          |                           | 3/4                                                           |\n| Heather Ann McSharry | 8/8     |                                   | 6/6                      | 5/5                       |                                                               |\n| Robin Phillips       | 8/8     |                                   |                          |                           | 4/4                                                           |\n| Emilio Saracho       | 8/8     |                                   |                          | 5/5                       | 3/4                                                           |\n| Nicola Shaw          | 8/8     |                                   |                          | 5/5                       | 4/4                                                           |",

        "page_content": "## Board activities\n\nThe key areas of Board activities during 2023 are outlined below:\n\n## Strategy and planning\n\nJoint Board/Management Committee two-day strategy session in September, including:\n\n- \u00b7  External view on airline industry\n- \u00b7  Market analysis - the Americas, Spain and intra-Europe, Asia and India\n- \u00b7  People and culture\n- \u00b7  Sustainability\n\n## Performance and monitoring\n\n- \u00b7  Operating companies' regular reporting, including transformation updates\n- \u00b7  Quarterly and full-year financial reporting\n- \u00b7  Monthly financial report (reviewed at the relevant meeting or distributed to all Board members)\n- \u00b7  Review of different joint business arrangements\n\n## Significant transactions, investments and expenditures\n\n- \u00b7  Financing arrangements\n- \u00b7  Aircraft leases and lease agreements for airport terminals and lounges\n- \u00b7  Treasury shares buyback programmes\n- \u00b7  Sustainable fuel provision agreements\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\n- \u00b7  Review risk map and risk appetite performance and statements\n- \u00b7  Assessment of viability and going concern\n- \u00b7  Effectiveness review of the internal control and risk management systems\n- \u00b7  External auditor's yearly report to the Board\n- \u00b7  Datacentre to Cloud migration update\n\n## Shareholders, stakeholders and governance\n\n- \u00b7  Transactions with related parties\n- \u00b7  Sustainability update\n- \u00b7  Modern Slavery statement review\n- \u00b7  Review feedback from institutional shareholders, roadshows as well as analyst reports\n- \u00b7  Board and management succession\n- \u00b7  Remuneration matters and Directors' Remuneration Policy review\n- \u00b7  Shareholders' meetings call notices and proposed resolutions\n- \u00b7  Review of the Board committees' composition\n- \u00b7  Board and committees' evaluation and improvement priorities\n- \u00b7  Update on the Directors' and Officers' insurance programme\n- \u00b7  Corporate governance updates\n- \u00b7  Organisational Health Index - culture review\n- \u00b7  Regular reporting from matters discussed by the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Nominations Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\n## Board information and training\n\nIn general, all Board and committee meeting documents are available to all directors ahead of meetings, including the minutes of each meeting, through an online platform which facilitates an efficient and secure access to all materials. All directors have access to the advice of the Board Secretary and the Group General Counsel. Directors may take independent legal, accounting, technical, financial, commercial, or other expert advice at the Company's expense when it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. No such independent advice was sought in the 2023 financial year.\n\nDirectors are offered the possibility to update and refresh their knowledge of the business and any technical related matter on an ongoing basis to enable them to continue fulfilling their responsibilities effectively. Directors are consulted about their training and development needs and given the opportunity to discuss this as part of the Board annual performance evaluation.\n\nDuring 2023, directors' training needs were met by a combination of internal presentations and updates as part of Board and committee meetings and specific sessions or deep dives on topics, where required. Sessions which took place included an update on competition law provided by management to all Board members; a session on safety presented by an external expert to the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee; and a presentation to the Audit and Compliance Committee on corporate governance reform proposals by the external auditor, KPMG. A session was also provided to the Board by an external speaker on geopolitics and macroeconomic developments. Training for 2024 includes sustainability and technology topics such as artificial intelligence.\n\n## Induction of directors\n\nAccording to the induction guidelines, approved by the Nominations Committee, on joining the Board every newly appointed director has a thorough and appropriate induction. Each programme is based on the individual director's needs and includes meetings with other directors, senior management and key external advisers as appropriate. The induction is designed to provide a wide overview of the industry and the sector, including details of each of the markets in which the Group operates, as well as an understanding of the Group business model and its different businesses. The programme is also a useful tool to introduce new directors to the IAG Management Committee as well as to the different operating companies' teams.\n\nIn prior years, the programme was considered thorough in its coverage of the Group and the industry.\n\nNo new directors were appointed during the year and therefore no induction programme was required.",

        "page_content": "## Board and committee evaluation\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board and its committees is reviewed annually, with an independent, externally facilitated review being conducted every three years. An internal evaluation was completed this year as an external review was undertaken in 2022.\n\nThe evaluation was led by the Chairman, supported by the Board Secretariat, using a self-assessment questionnaire complemented by an individual interview conducted by the Chairman with each non-executive director. The results were presented in a report to all Board members, and an action plan to address matters raised was agreed.\n\nThe overall conclusions of the review were positive, confirming that the Board and the committees continued to adequately fulfil their responsibilities and operated effectively during the reporting period.\n\nIn relation to the agreed actions for 2023, the Board considered that good progress had been made during the year. Regular updates on shareholder and investor engagement would continue and be enhanced. Ensuring that the Board continues to have the relevant skills and expertise remains an ongoing area of attention for the Nominations Committee. The focus on customer experience would also continue.\n\nIn addition to reviewing progress against the agreed action plan for 2023, the Board evaluation highlighted the strong working relationship between the Board and management, the progress made on operating company transformation, as well as the enhanced focus on culture and people.\n\nActions agreed for 2024 include:\n\n- \u00b7  broadening the Board's visibility on engagement with stakeholders, with a focus on customers, suppliers and investors;\n- \u00b7  prioritising the focus on management succession planning and talent development, as well as on the diversity and inclusion agenda; and\n- \u00b7  continuing to oversee the cultural transformation of the Group.\n\n## Other statutory information of interest, and related party\n\n## Directors' disclosure duties, conflicts transactions\n\nDirectors must inform the Company of any participation or interest they may hold or acquire in any company that is a competitor of the Group, or any activities that could place them in conflict with the corporate interest.\n\nAccording to article 21 of the Board Regulations, directors have an obligation to adopt the measures necessary to avoid conflict of interest situations. These include any situation where the interest of the director, either directly or through third parties, may conflict with the corporate interest or with their duties to the Company. In the event of conflict, the affected director must inform the Company and abstain from participating in the discussion of the transaction referred to by the conflict. For the purposes of calculating the quorum and voting majorities, the affected director would be excluded from the number of members in attendance.\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting held on 15 June 2023 approved the reelection of Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips as non-executive proprietary directors as proposed by IAG's significant shareholder Qatar Airways Group (Q.C.S.C.) ('Qatar Airways'). Qatar Airways, a Middle East air carrier headquartered in Doha, has been the single largest shareholder of IAG since 2016, owning, as of the date of this report, 25.143% of the share capital of the Company. Throughout this period there has been a long-standing business and commercial relationship between Qatar Airways and the Group airlines. This close relationship of commercial cooperation, which has always been undertaken on an arm's length basis and on market terms, significantly reduces the potential existence of permanent conflicts of interest between Qatar Airways and the Group's airlines.\n\nAs far as the relationship of the proprietary directors with the significant shareholder who proposed their appointments is concerned, it should be noted that Giles Agutter is the owner and Chief Executive of the consultancy services firm Southern Sky Limited, one of whose material clients is Qatar Airways, and that Robin Phillips has no relevant connection with Qatar Airways.\n\nAny potential conflict of interest that might affect such proprietary directors is managed by applying the duty of abstention in accordance with the procedure for managing conflicts of interest described below. In addition, the Spanish and the UK regimes on related parties' transactions are also applicable as detailed below.\n\nIn accordance with article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, the Board of Directors has the exclusive authority to approve transactions with directors or shareholders that have a significant holding or that are represented on the Board or with any persons related to them, on the terms established in the law and the Board Regulations and this will require a prior report from the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe execution of these type of transactions needs to be reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee to ensure that they are carried out at arm's length and with due observance of the principle of equal treatment of shareholders. IAG's internal regulations on related party transactions establish that the Audit and Compliance Committee needs to issue a report to the Board assessing whether the transaction is fair and reasonable from the standpoint of the Company and, where applicable, of the shareholders other than the related party, and report on this assessment, including the assumptions and methods used. Where appropriate, the directors related to the transaction shall not participate in the preparation of such report.\n\nDepending on the amount or value of the proposed related party transaction, different corporate governance and disclosure requirements may apply under both the Spanish and UK legal frameworks.\n\nIn accordance with IAG procedures on related party transactions, prior to the Audit and Compliance Committee consideration, shareholder related party transactions are also reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and are reported to the IAG Head of Group Audit.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders' meeting\n\nThe quorum required for the constitution of the shareholder's meeting, the system of adopting corporate resolutions, the procedure for amending the Bylaws and the applicable rules for protecting shareholders' rights when changing the Bylaws are governed by the provisions established in the Spanish Companies Law.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting was held on 15 June 2023 in Madrid. This was again held in person as in 2022, with the option for shareholders to attend and participate in the meeting remotely.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting Regulations, which establish the operating rules of the shareholder meeting, are available in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website.\n\n## Disclosure obligations\n\nThe Company's Bylaws establish a series of special obligations concerning disclosure of share ownership as well as certain limits on shareholdings, taking into account the ownership and control restrictions provided for in applicable legislation and bilateral air transport treaties signed by Spain and the UK.\n\nIn accordance with article 7.2 b) of the Bylaws, shareholders must notify the Company of any acquisition or disposal of shares or of any interest in the shares of the Company that directly or indirectly entails the acquisition or disposal of a stake of over 0.25% of the Company's share capital, or of the voting rights corresponding thereto, expressly indicating the nationality of the transferor and/or the transferee obliged to notify, as well as the creation of any charges on shares (or interests in shares) or other encumbrances whatsoever, for the purposes of the exercise of the rights conferred by them.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to article 10 of the Bylaws, the Company may require any shareholder or any other person with a confirmed or apparent interest in shares of the Company to disclose to the Company in writing such information as the Company shall require relating to the beneficial ownership of or any interest in the shares in question, as lies within the knowledge of such shareholder or other person, including any information that the Company deems necessary or desirable in order to determine the nationality of the holders of said shares or other person with an interest in the Company's shares or whether it is necessary to take steps in order to protect the operating rights of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nIn the event of a breach of these obligations by a shareholder or any other person with a confirmed or apparent interest in the Company's shares, the Board may suspend the voting or other political rights of the relevant person. If the shares associated with the breach represent at least 0.25% of the Company's share capital in nominal value, the Board may also direct that the transfer of any such shares is not registered.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares\n\nIn the event that the Board deems it necessary or appropriate to adopt measures to protect an operating right of the Company or of its subsidiaries, in light of the nationality of its shareholders or any persons with an interest in the Company's shares, it may adopt any of the measures in article 11 of the Bylaws, including the determination of a maximum number of shares that may be held by non-qualifying shareholders provided that such maximum may not be lower than 40% of the Company's share capital. If such a determination is made and notified to the stock market, no further acquisitions of shares by non-qualifying persons can be made.\n\nIn such circumstances, if non-qualifying persons acquire shares in breach of such restriction, the Board may also (i) agree on the suspension of voting and other political rights of the holder of the relevant shares, and (ii) request that the holders dispose of the corresponding shares so that no non-qualifying person may directly or indirectly own such shares or have an interest in the same. If such transfer is not performed on the terms provided for in the Bylaws, the Company may acquire the corresponding shares (for their subsequent redemption) pursuant to applicable legislation. This acquisition must be performed at the lower of the following prices: (a) the book value of the corresponding shares according to the latest published audited balance sheet of the Company; and (b) the middle market quotation for an ordinary share of the Company as derived from the London Stock Exchange's Daily Official List for the business day on which they were acquired by the relevant non-qualifying person.\n\n## Impact of change of control\n\nThe following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination in the event of a change of control of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7  Certain significant IAG financing arrangements allow for prepayment, redemption or early termination in certain circumstances if there is a change of control of the Company.\n\nIn addition, the Company's share plans contain provisions as a result of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable on a change of control of the Company in accordance with the rules of the plans.\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability insurance\n\nThe Company has purchased insurance against Directors' and Officers' liability for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board receives an annual update on the Group's Directors' and Officers' liability insurance.",

This report provides an overview of the work of the Committee and its activities during the year.\n\nThe contribution of this Committee is key to ensuring that we have in place both a Board with the right combination of relevant skills and capabilities as well as an executive team capable of delivering our strategy. As in previous years, in 2023 the Committee focused on succession planning and oversight of the work being done on diversity and inclusion for both the Board and senior leaders.\n\nBoard succession planning remains an area of work to ensure collective board ability to oversee the implementation of the Group's strategy and effectively support management to drive\n\ntransformation. Building on the findings of the external Board evaluation conducted in 2022, which are in line with this year's internal exercise, we have a clear understanding of the skills and expertise required and the aspects that we could strengthen, so that we continue to ensure the necessary expertise and experience on our Board and its committees.\n\nExecutive succession planning and talent development has been an important area of focus. The ongoing monitoring of management's plans and programmes to improve the benchstrength and diversity of the Group's senior leadership through active succession planning and talent management is a priority for the Committee. We also continue to review succession planning for the leadership teams at our operating companies. This year the Committee considered several\n\nnew appointments to the IAG Management Committee and to the boards and leadership teams of some of our operating companies, including the appointment of Fernando Candela as Chairman and CEO of Iberia; Julio Rodriguez as Chief Commercial Strategy Officer; Jorge Saco as Chief Information, Procurement, Services and Innovation Officer; and Jonathan Sullivan as Chief Transformation and Corporate Development Officer.\n\nFollowing the refresh of both our Board Directors Selection and Diversity Policy and our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Policy in 2022, we continue to build on the diversity strategy and framework.\n\nWe are satisfied that the Board composition continues to meet the targets for the proportion of women on boards and ethnic diversity as set out in either the European and Spanish standards and the UK Listings Rules, the latter informed by the UK FTSE Women Leaders Review and the UK Parker Review.\n\nThe Committee also supports management's efforts to strengthen the presence of women in the senior leadership of the Company and across the Group. Despite progress made in 2023, we still have a way to go to reach our target of 40% of senior leadership roles being held by women by 2025. IAG leadership is committed to this ambition and more generally to promoting an environment that ensures inclusion and equal opportunities. The clear gender targets are being supplemented with broader diversity ambitions, including ethnicity. Current initiatives underway are both supported and closely monitored by the Committee.\n\nIn line with the expectations of the UK and Spanish Corporate Governance Codes, we undertook an internal Board and Committee effectiveness review. More information on the results of this evaluation, and how it was carried out, can be found elsewhere in this report. The evaluation was very positive, and it remains the case that we are satisfied that the Board and its Committees are effective and provide the highest standards of leadership and oversight of the Group's strategy. The Nominations Committee will continue to provide a special focus to management succession planning and talent development, as well as to the work on diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nNominations Committee Chair",

        "page_content": "## The Nominations Committee\n\nThe composition, competencies and operating rules of the Nominations Committee are regulated by article 31 of the Board Regulations and by the Nominations Committee Regulations as approved by the Board on 25 February 2021. A copy of the Board and the Nominations Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for appointments to the Board and to ensure that these appointments bring the necessary skills, experience, and competencies to the Board, aligning its composition to the business strategy and needs. The Committee also reports to the Board on the proposed appointment of senior executives of the Company and IAG appointments to Group company boards. It oversees Board and senior management succession planning and in general the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.\n\nThe Nominations Committee shall be made up of no less than three non-executive directors appointed by the Board, with the dedication, capacity, and experience necessary to carry out its function. A majority of the members must be independent directors that are EU nationals.\n\nThere were no changes to the Committee's membership during 2023.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities\n\nThe Nominations Committee's responsibilities can be summarised as:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the mix of competencies, knowledge, and experience necessary in the Board's membership and reviewing the criteria for the Board composition and the selection of candidates\n- \u00b7  submitting the recommendation for appointment of directors to the Board for approval, and reporting on the proposed designations of the members of the Board committees and their chairs\n- \u00b7  succession planning for Board members making proposals to the Board so that such succession occurs in a planned and orderly manner\n- \u00b7  reporting to the Board on the appointment and removal of senior executives (which includes all of the IAG Management Committee)\n- \u00b7  ensuring that non-executive directors receive appropriate induction programmes\n- \u00b7  setting diversity targets (gender, ethnicity, and other criteria) both within the senior management and the succession pipeline\n- \u00b7  ensuring that plans are in place for orderly succession of senior management positions whilst safeguarding the achievement of agreed diversity targets\n- \u00b7  establishing a target for female and ethnicity representation on the Board which should adhere to the Company's Directors Selection and Diversity Policy\n- \u00b7  coordinating the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board and its committees\n\n## The Committee's activities in 2023\n\nThe Committee met six times during 2023, with three scheduled and three ad-hoc meetings called to discuss management changes or appointments to the Group company boards. Directors' attendance at these meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance section. The Group Chief Executive was invited to attend the Committee's meetings as and when necessary.\n\nThe Committee focused on the following activities during the year:\n\n- \u00b7  review of the composition of the Board\n- \u00b7  review of the Board committees' membership\n- \u00b7  Board succession planning\n- \u00b7  review of the directors' independence\n- \u00b7  review of compliance with the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy\n- \u00b7  review of diversity and inclusion\n- \u00b7  management succession plans\n- \u00b7  format of the annual Board evaluation process, as well as that of the Nominations Committee\n- \u00b7  changes to Group company boards\n- \u00b7  review of investor feedback from the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Board succession\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews the formal succession plan for the Board, including analysis of non-executive directors' length of tenure, skills and experience, and planning for succession relating to any areas that could require strengthening from a skills and succession perspective.\n\nIn September 2023, the Committee considered Board succession planning, including the Board refreshment timeline, the Board skills matrix, as well as the consideration and identification of those skills and characteristics relevant for future appointments to align with strategic objectives and policies. The Committee also noted that in terms of Spanish company law, the chairmanship of the Audit and Compliance Committee would need to be refreshed during 2024, and discussed planning for this succession.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' independence, performance and re-election\n\nThe Nominations Committee, having considered the matter carefully, is of the opinion that all the current non-executive directors, with the exception of the two proprietary directors, are independent, both in line with the definition set out by the Spanish Companies Act and with that of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and are free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement.\n\nIn May 2023 the Nominations Committee considered the proposal for the reelection of directors ahead of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the Board Regulations, all proposals for the appointment or re-election of directors presented to the 2023 Annual General Meeting were accompanied by an explanatory report issued by the Board of Directors with the support of the Nominations Committee assessing the competence, experience, and merits of each candidate. As part of its assessment, the Committee also reviews the time commitment and availability of each non-executive director.\n\nFollowing this review, the Committee was of the opinion that each nonexecutive director submitting themselves for re-election continued to demonstrate commitment to the role as a member of the Board and its committees and that each was making a valuable contribution to the leadership of the Company.\n\nEach director is required to advise the Committee and seek its authorisation before accepting any external directorship or other significant appointment that might affect the time they are able to devote to the role as a director of the Company.\n\n## Management appointments and succession planning\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee considered and presented to the Board the following appointments to the IAG Management Committee: Fernando Candela as Chairman and CEO of Iberia; Julio Rodriguez as Chief Commercial Strategy Officer; Jorge Saco as Chief Information, Procurement, Services and Innovation Officer; and Jonathan Sullivan as Chief Transformation and Corporate Development Officer.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe procedure for the appointment of directors follows the principles established in the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy which has as its objective, the recognition of the importance of board diversity in a broader sense. As recommended by the Spanish Good Governance Code, the Nominations Committee reviews compliance with this Policy on an annual basis. The review for the 2023 reporting period was completed in January 2024. The diversity targets included in the Policy are to have:\n\n- \u00b7  at least 40% female board membership;\n- \u00b7  at least one of the Chair, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer roles be filled by a woman; and\n- \u00b7  at least one member of the Board being from an ethnic minority.\n\nGender diversity principles are followed throughout the director appointment process, while preserving the general diversity and merit-based appointment principles established in the Policy. The Board's policy is to consider candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, without discrimination based on gender, race, colour, age, social class, beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other factors. When conducting a search, the Company will only engage search firms that have signed up to the latest UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms (or its international equivalent). Additionally, the Nominations Committee ensures that the Board appointment 'long' and 'short' lists provided in the search process are inclusive according to the widest definition of diversity.\n\nFemale directors currently represent 45% of the Board, ahead of the target of at least 40%, and 63% of the independent non-executive directors (including the Chairman). In addition to this, three of the four Board advisory committees are chaired by women: the Audit and Compliance, the Remuneration and the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committees. Lastly, the Senior Independent Director is a woman. From an ethnic minority perspective, the IAG Board has met its target to have one director from an ethnic minority group.\n\nWhen considering director appointments, the Committee follows a formal, rigorous, and transparent procedure, designed to capture the value of diversity in its broader sense, including a mix of skills, experience, professional and industry backgrounds, age, and ethnicity, while ensuring that any appointment is made on merit. Diversity considerations also include ensuring that more than half of the Board are independent EU nationals to meet regulatory obligations.",

IAG's aim is for both senior leaders and our businesses to reflect the diverse communities we work in and to create an environment where individuals feel their unique differences are valued. Beyond gender and ethnicity, the Management Committee is comprised of individuals with multiple nationalities (including Spanish, British, American, dual Brazilian/Argentinian, Irish and Italian). In addition, most of the executives have multi-jurisdictional backgrounds and/or careers which serve to enhance the value that they bring to the Group, its customers and employees. Further information on Board diversity is included in the Corporate Governance section of this report.\n\nThe Board and the Nominations Committee are committed to improving diversity, including gender diversity, across the Group, encouraging and supporting management actions in this regard. IAG has a target of 40% of senior leadership roles to be held by women by 2025. At the end of 2023, IAG had 36% of women in those roles, up from 34% at year end 2022, and on track to achieve the 2025 target. In line with the Group's diversity and inclusion framework and strategy, the Group's operating companies and platform businesses have implemented a range of initiatives to support equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\nIn 2023, IAG partnered with Green Park, an independent UK-based talent and diversity consultancy, to conduct a survey to better understand the composition and diversity of IAG's senior leadership, going beyond gender to include a broad range of factors regarding identity. The survey was voluntary, anonymous and confidential, designed to take into account the legal and cultural contexts and regulatory requirements of our key countries of operation. The results are based only on those individuals who self-disclosed their data and will provide a baseline of the diversity of IAG's senior leaders, enabling IAG to track progress over time. 6% of IAG's UK senior leaders self-disclosed as ethnically diverse and IAG's senior leaders globally represent over twenty nationalities. To ensure the continued focus on increasing representation, IAG has introduced an ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for our UK senior leaders by the end of 2027. Results will be shared with our senior leaders to inform our people strategies and support discussions around equity, diversity and inclusion and responses feed into the UK Parker review.\n\nFurther details and explanations of the steps that IAG is taking to promote diversity and inclusion across the Group is set out in the People section and the Equity, diversity and inclusion subsection of Sustainability in the Strategic report.\n\n## The Committee annual evaluation\n\nThe annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees was internally facilitated in 2023, following an external evaluation in 2022, and as set out in the Corporate Governance Report.\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the Committee operated effectively during the year. The Committee continues to maintain as a priority its focus on board and management succession planning, including talent retention and development, as well as diversity and inclusion, as these are two complex matters where changes are generated over the medium and long term.",

This report highlights some of our work and activities during the year.\n\nThis Committee assists the Board in a dual role. Firstly, by providing high-level oversight of the Group's safety activities and resources, and promoting the sharing of knowledge and best practices within the Group. Secondly, the Committee provides guidance and direction on IAG's sustainability\n\nprogrammes and corporate responsibility ambitions, ensuring alignment to the Group's sustainability strategic priorities.\n\nBased on the conclusions of the evaluation of the Committee's performance in 2022, we decided to restructure the Committee's work so that it is more focused, devoting two of its four ordinary meetings mainly to safety issues and the other two to environmental and corporate responsibility matters.\n\nAs we did last year, the Committee reviewed the information on the\n\nprincipal sustainability ratings followed by the Company. For the fourth year running, we are pleased to have been awarded a CDP leadership grade (A-). This is the longest leadership performance of any airline and recognises the continued commitment of IAG in addressing its climate change impacts.\n\nThe Committee has been regularly updated on the numerous regulatory initiatives affecting sustainability. In particular, and with the support from the Audit and Compliance Committee, we also continue to put focus on improving our reporting, both internally and externally. We are pleased with progress being made towards a reasonable assurance report being provided for our statement of non-financial information before 2027.\n\nRegulatory developments and the impact on IAG were a key focus for the Committee again this year together with consideration of relevant industry developments. An external benchmarking report provided a good base to identify focus areas for future management attention, and was well received by the Committee.\n\nIn addition to the core work on tracking progress against our overall sustainability strategy and objectives, the Committee had a specific update on sustainability matters focused on the Group's suppliers, including modern slavery and human trafficking, as well as considerations regarding payment terms.\n\nThe Committee continued its work monitoring the safety performance of IAG's airline companies. This included the systems and resources dedicated to safety activities across the Group. In line with the Group's business model, responsibility for safety and security lies with each Group airline and is applied in accordance with the company's applicable standards, culture and the circumstances and characteristics of each business. This Committee exercises a high-level oversight of safety activities to ensure a minimum Group standard, supporting the Group homogenisation effort in safety reporting, the discussion of common issues and the sharing of best practices between Group airlines.",

Also in the regulatory context, the Committee has decided to consider on an annual basis, in a specific way, the communications received from the various regulators on the safety performance of each of the Group's airlines.\n\nThis year, the Committee looked closely at the safety issues associated with the transport of lithium batteries and the approaches taken by the Group's various airlines. The Committee was also briefed on the operations of the Group in areas of conflict.\n\nFundamental to our ambition is doing business in the right way. This is why sustainability is at the heart of our strategy as highlighted in November at the Capital Markets Day, with a dedicated presentation focusing on sustainability and the leading position that IAG is taking in the industry. Attendees were provided with an update on IAG's progress and how we are using multiple decarbonisation solutions to achieve our net zero ambitions by 2050. The support of our other stakeholders, including policymakers, will be key for the industry.\n\nThe Committee's performance was evaluated as part of an internal evaluation process. We used this opportunity to spend some time discussing the work programme and adapting it to ensure we continued to prioritise the right matters. We also agreed to continue to engage with external parties including those with expertise in the various components of our remit to enhance our work.\n\nI am delighted with the continued progress that has been made in the past year and look forward to furthering our ambitions in 2024.\n\n## Nicola Shaw\n\nSafety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair\n\n## The Safety, Environment, and Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nThe Committee's composition, competencies and operating rules are regulated by article 33 of the Board Regulations as well as by the Regulations of the SECR Committee. A copy of the Board and the SECR Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Committee shall be made up of no less than three directors appointed by the Board, with the necessary dedication, capacity and experience. All the members of the Committee are non-executive directors with the majority being independent directors.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at Committee meetings included the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer. Senior managers with responsibility for safety matters and others in charge of different sustainability areas were invited to attend specific agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\n## The Committee's role and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's role is to support and advise the Board in matters relating to safety, environment and corporate responsibility. Responsibility for safety matters belongs to the Group's airlines. IAG, through this Committee, has an overall view of each airline's safety performance and of any important issues that may affect the industry. The Committee also has visibility of the Group airlines' resources and procedures. Responsibility for performing detailed and technical assessments remains with each airline. In the areas of environment and corporate responsibility, the SECR Committee provides a governance forum for non-executive directors to exercise specific oversight, challenge and support to senior management in shaping the Group's sustainability strategy, policies and targets, buttressing IAG's vision to be a world's leading airline group on sustainability.\n\nAccording to its regulations, the SECR Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7  to receive significant safety information about IAG's subsidiaries, franchise, codeshare or wet-lease providers used by any member of the Group\n- \u00b7  to exercise a high-level overview of safety activities and resources\n- \u00b7  to review the Group's strategy and policies on social and environmental sustainability\n- \u00b7  to evaluate that the Company's environment and social practices are in accordance with the established strategy and policies",

Directors' attendance at these meetings is detailed in the Corporate Governance report.\n\nThe Committee's activities during the year included:\n\n- \u00b7  Group airline safety and security reviews;\n- \u00b7  review of significant safety and security issues;\n- \u00b7  lithium batteries update;\n- \u00b7  review of sustainability and nonfinancial information reporting;\n- \u00b7  overview of sustainability trends;\n- \u00b7  Group sustainability strategy, including benchmarking;\n- \u00b7  review of sustainability compliance and key metrics;\n- \u00b7  IAG waste strategy, performance indicators and benchmarking;\n- \u00b7  regulatory updates;\n- \u00b7  review of the annual update to the Group Modern Slavery Statement;\n- \u00b7  sustainability risk review; and\n- \u00b7  Modern Slavery and Human Rights review.\n\n## Safety\n\nKey topics discussed for each airline under their regular safety review include information on safety risk management, safety culture, operational risks, occupational injury risks, as well as reported data on aircraft damage. This year, the safety managers of each of the Group's airlines completed the revision of their reporting framework to this Committee, in order to homogenise and simplify the issues reported by the different airlines and to enhance comparability and sharing of best practices within the Group. In addition to this, the Committee considered some specific topics, including the Group airlines' preparatory work for the transition to new rules regarding Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO).\n\nA representative from the Spanish agency Servicios y Estudios para la Navegaci\u00f3n A\u00e9rea y la Seguridad Aeron\u00e1utica (SENASA) joined the July Committee meeting to make a presentation on the aviation general safety framework.

This year this included updates on the European Union 'Fit for 55' package, the UK Jet Zero Council, as well as the first meeting of the Spanish Alliance for Air Transport Sustainability.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nAt its meeting in May, the Committee considered a sustainability benchmarking exercise across all ESG factors conducted by an international sustainability and technology consultancy. The report provided an overview of IAG's position in relation to the industry on a range of sustainability factors and provided a good roadmap for future management and Committee focus.\n\n## Waste strategy, performance indicators and benchmarking\n\nThe Committee considered an update on performance against its waste strategy plan adopted in 2021, with objectives due to be met by 2025. In addition to noting its current performance and endorsing the strategic objectives in this area, the Committee also considered industry developments, noting IAG's performance was positive on a relative basis.",

The evaluation concluded that the Committee operated effectively during the year. Notwithstanding this, the Committee agreed on several improvements for the coming year. In the area of safety, the Committee will analyse the safety corporate governance structures both in the different operating companies and in other airline groups with a view to improving coordination with the Group airlines and facilitating the exercise by this Committee of its general supervisory function. In the area of sustainability, the Committee will strengthen the focus on sustainable fuels and organise a knowledge update session in coordination with the Audit and Compliance Committee, as was done a few years ago.\n\nAs in previous years, the Committee reviewed the Group sustainability risk assessments for the business plan period 2024 to 2026 and to 2030, which helped the Committee understand the physical, policy, market and technology risks that the Group has considered could impact its sustainability ambitions. Further information regarding risks are set out in the Risk section of this annual report.",

The Committee continues to play an important role in IAG's governance framework, overseeing risk management, internal controls, financial and non-financial reporting, compliance, internal and external audit while also closely monitoring the macroeconomic and political environment and its impact on the business and its risks. This report provides an overview of the key matters considered in 2023, as well as insight into how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities and provided assurance on the integrity and reporting compliance of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe Committee held five planned meetings and two brief ad hoc meetings (to discuss specific matters such as auditor effectiveness) during 2023. The\n\nkey items discussed by the Committee in discharging its oversight responsibilities and its areas of focus are set out in further detail in this report.\n\nThe Group has focused during 2023 on reconnecting the world, transformation, returning the operations to preCOVID-19 capacity and improving resilience. As a result the Committee has increased its focus on the risk management, internal controls and financial implications of the strategy implementation. The rapidly evolving political and economic uncertainty arising from the wars in Ukraine and Middle East, along with continuing inflationary and recessionary pressures, has resulted in the need to constantly ensure these have been reflected by management in risk management, financial forecasts, strategic plan, going concern and viability assessments. In addition, digital security is fundamental\n\nto the Group's operational resilience, and during 2023 management's actions to improve digital and IT processes and systems have remained key areas of focus of the Committee.\n\nThroughout 2023, I have maintained a dialogue with all members of the Committee, management and the internal auditors. I have met with 'agenda topic owners' along with other Committee members prior to Committee meetings, ensuring the Committee would be provided with the necessary information to enable it to guide, challenge, advise and, when required, make informed decisions. I also met regularly with the lead partners of our external auditor, KPMG, and the Head of Group Audit.\n\nThe Committee ensures the reliability of the Group's financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations, through the internal control framework, including the mature Group-wide Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and risk management frameworks. During the year, the Committee closely monitored developments in and management's response to the UK Government's proposed UK Corporate Governance Reform agenda, the FRC's review of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the passing of the UK Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. While the UK Government's proposed reforms and elements of the proposed Code changes are not being taken forward, the Committee noted that key learnings in management's preparation for adoption have strengthened the Group's governance and controls.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee obtained external independent assessments of the Group's whistleblower/speaking up programme and ethics and compliance maturity, drawing management and the Committee's attention to a number of improvement opportunities. Management is preparing a programme to address the priority findings highlighted. This will be a key area of focus for the Committee in 2024, including monitoring the execution of management's programme supported by Internal Audit.",

        "page_content": "I am confident that, throughout 2023, we have ensured: the key challenges and risks faced by the Group were reflected in the external and internal audit plans; effective controls remained in place; changes in the drivers of our principal and emerging risks were identified and effectively managed; ongoing compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations; and sound financial judgements and estimates continued to be made.\n\nI would like to express my sincere appreciation to all relevant Group and external and internal audit teams for their support of the Committee in delivering its remit.\n\nThe Spanish Code permits a Director to Chair the Audit and Compliance Committee for a maximum of four years. This report, relating to 2023, is therefore my last report before I step down as Chair of the Committee in September 2024.\n\n## Margaret Ewing\n\nAudit and Compliance Committee Chair\n\n## The Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nThe composition, competencies and operating remit of the Audit and Compliance Committee are regulated by article 29 of the Board Regulations as well as the Regulations of the Audit and Compliance Committee, both reviewed and approved in February 2021. A copy of these Regulations can be found on IAG's website. Following the recent publication of the updated UK Corporate Governance Code and related guidance, the Committee will review its regulations in the second half of 2024 and update them accordingly to reflect the updated Code and other relevant developments expected to be published in Spain.\n\n## The Committee's composition, competencies and attendance\n\nDetailed biographies of all Committee members are included in this Annual Report. The Board is satisfied that the Committee has retained competence relevant to its overall responsibilities, including possessing a wide range of financial, audit, risk management and relevant sector and business experience amongst its members, providing the right mix of skills and experience to provide constructive challenge and support to management. The Board has determined that Margaret Ewing and Maurice Lam have recent and relevant financial experience and the Board, through the Nominations Committee, will continue to review the Committee's membership to ensure the skills and experience of its members align with the business as it develops.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at Committee meetings included the Chairman, the Head of Group Audit (who reports functionally to the Chair of the Committee) and representatives from the external auditor. Members of the Management Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group General Counsel and the Group Financial Controller were invited to attend specific agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\nA private session of the Committee members was held at the end of each Committee meeting and during the year the Committee met privately on a number of occasions with each of the external and internal auditor and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities and activities\n\nThe Committee's principal responsibilities are to oversee and provide assurance to the Board on the integrity and quality of financial reporting, effectiveness of audit arrangements and robustness and effective operation of internal controls, compliance and risk management processes and fraud prevention and detection. The Committee meeting agendas are tailored to ensure emerging topics are included and to allow for ad hoc discussion and reviews. A summary of the Committee's activities during 2023 and until the date of this report is detailed below.",

The Committee was reassured that the migration reconfirmed the appropriateness of the loyalty  scheme liabilities with no material adjustments as a result of the transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Voucher revenue  recognition                                                | The Committee received quarterly updates throughout 2023 on management's assumptions in relation  to revenue recognition relating to vouchers issued in relation to conditions during and immediately after the  COVID-19 pandemic, including issuances, redemptions, refunds and the amounts recognised as breakage.  For the years to 31 December 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Group recognised no breakage on vouchers but given  the recovery from COVID-19, coupled with the availability of sufficient historical redemption and expiry data,  the Group has commenced recognising breakage on a limited population of the voucher liability during 2023.  The Committee agrees with management's assessment that breakage can now be reliably estimated and that  there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in future periods as a result of having recorded breakage  during 2023. The Committee also recognised that as vouchers began to contractually expire in 2023 and  management has been taking action to encourage voucher holders to utilise their vouchers before they expire, |\n| Group accounting  policy on major  maintenance  events for leased  aircraft | During the course of 2023, management presented to the Committee a detailed analysis of the Company's  accounting policies, in response to the enquiries from the CNMV, with regard to major maintenance events on  owned and leased aircraft, including peer benchmarking, industry guidance and analysis of alternative  accounting policies. In particular, for leased aircraft, IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how to account  for major maintenance events and whether to adopt a provisions approach, whereby provisions for such  maintenance events are built up over time through the usage of the asset, or to apply the components  approach, whereby each major maintenance event is capitalised and depreciated to the sooner of the next  event or the end of the lease. The Committee concurred with the continued application of the existing  accounting policy of applying the provisions approach.                                                                                                                                                                      |",

The Committee's reassurance was gained by a review  of critical estimation assumptions and judgements applied in relation to cash flow forecasts over the short,  medium and long term, including the implications of climate change where they impacted the reference period.  Many of the assumptions and judgements are based on events outside the Group's control including the  political and economic influences such as the wars in the Ukraine and the Middle East, volatile fuel prices and  high inflation and interest rates.

In May, the Committee  received a detailed briefing (from the external auditor) of the UK Government's and FRC's corporate  governance and Code reform proposals and management presented its plans and proposed timelines to adopt  the various governance initiatives as well as a view of those initiatives already in place under the Group's                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Non-financial  information and  environment | ensure full compliance in accordance with the relevant regulatory and legal timetable.  In conjunction with the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, the Committee plays  a key role in the governance of regulatory reporting requirements in respect of non-financial information,  particularly those related to workforce data and climate-related risks and opportunities. This Committee  is pleased with management's significant progress in designing and documenting internal controls over  non-financial reporting (ICNFR) across the Group to ensure there are robust processes and controls in place  to obtain reliable data.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Risk appetite  framework                    | compliance and EU taxonomy. In early 2023, the Board (supported by management) introduced a new risk appetite framework which set  tolerances across the business plan period and enabled consideration of trade-offs to facilitate prioritisation  of initiatives to manage opportunities and risk within the defined appetite tolerances.  The Committee received an update from management in December on the Group's performance against the  appetite tolerances set at the beginning of 2023. The Committee is satisfied that the new framework is aligned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Compliance                                  | December Board meeting. The Committee recognises the critical role of compliance in upholding the highest ethical standards across  the Group. A Group Head of Compliance and Ethics was appointed in June 2023. The Committee requested an  independent review be undertaken of both the Group's whistleblowing provisions and culture as well as the  maturity of the overall ethics and compliance capabilities. In addition to receiving the annual compliance update  from management, in December Deloitte presented the conclusions of its independent assessment including  the areas it believes are opportunities for improvement across the Group. Management is preparing its  response and plans for addressing the recommendations and this will be a key area of focus for the Committee  during 2024 and 2025. |\n\nThe Committee will continue to receive regular updates on all the above matters in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the supervision of the existence and effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). The Board has delegated the responsibility for the development of effective controls to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the supervision of the effectiveness of these controls to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Group's ICFR monitoring and auditing is mature and well embedded across the Group, covering processes applied by the Company, Aer Lingus, British Airways, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty, Iberia and Vueling, and processes performed by IAG GBS and IAG Cargo on behalf of the operating companies. This enables the Committee to evaluate and oversee IAG's management of financial reporting risk and to validate the Group's approach to complying with the CNMV's ICFR recommendations.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee reviewed the results of the internal audits and external audit of ICFR (which included IT general controls). Despite the return to preCOVID-19 pandemic operating conditions in 2023, no unremediated material or significant weaknesses that would impact the integrity of the financial statements were identified, and management continued to improve the control environment across the Group. The Committee also tracked the progress of internal audit recommendations to address any weaknesses identified.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Committee's activities during 2023 in relation to the Internal Audit function included:\n\n- \u00b7  reviewing and agreeing the internal audit 2023 plan and 2024 first six months plan (including resourcing and budget to appoint appropriate external specialist resource and recruit additional permanent resource when required to ensure the function is appropriately resourced to provide the required level of assurance over the principal risks, processes and controls throughout the Group). This included ensuring the 2023 plan continued to focus on fraud risk while also ensuring coverage of specific risks, including cyber security, IT transformation programmes, nonfinancial information and satisfying ICFR and Spanish Criminal Code requirements;\n- \u00b7  reviewing key audit conclusions, discussing the quality and timeliness of management's responses, monitoring the resolution of issues raised and requesting additional audit review of certain weaknesses or concerns identified by internal audit, post management action to remediate. Where an internal audit finding was rated seriously deficient, relevant responsible management were requested to, in person, present their plans and progress in addressing the audit recommendations and required actions, reflecting the importance the Committee attributes to the internal audits and their conclusions;\n\n- \u00b7  holding regular meetings during the year between the Committee, the Head of Group Audit and the external audit partners as well as ensuring the Head of Group Audit feels able to raise any concerns informally and directly with the Chair of the Committee;\n- \u00b7  monitoring and protecting internal audit's independence and standing within the Group, ensuring its ability to influence and engage at the most senior levels across IAG and all operating companies and functions and is closely involved in the Group's discussions on risk; and\n- \u00b7  performing an effectiveness review with key stakeholders in December 2023.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that delivery of the approved internal audit strategy and plan is providing timely and appropriate assurance on the effectiveness of controls in place to successfully and effectively manage aspects of the Group's relevant principal risks (i.e. those that are capable of being subject to an audit review).",

Following completion of the 2022 audit, the UK lead audit partner retired and Paul Nichols was appointed as KPMG's UK lead audit partner, following his shadowing and transitioning activities during 2022.\n\nThe Committee Chair met frequently with the Group and lead audit partners throughout the year to review Group developments, audit progress, their planned reporting and audit findings. The Committee's key activities in relation to its interaction with KPMG included:\n\n- \u00b7  review of KPMG's third-year audit arrangements and plan, and overseeing progress throughout 2023;\n- \u00b7  approval of the 2023 external audit plan and strategy including consideration of scope, approach and methodology, emerging industry and Group-specific audit risks and materiality. Monitoring the audit plan's implementation, including receiving regular reports from KPMG, progress against plan in consideration of key judgements, audit matters and any significant weaknesses detected in the internal control environment;\n- \u00b7  discussion, prior to recommendation of the financial statements to the Board for approval, of the audit findings, including audit differences, and observations on internal controls, operations and resources. This included challenging the auditors on their conclusions regarding voucher revenue recognition discussed in significant financial reporting matters.\n- \u00b7  performing an assessment of the effectiveness and independence of KPMG, including the quality of the 2023 audit (throughout the year), implementation of improvement opportunities identified in the 2022 effectiveness assessment and reviewing and approving the fees and terms of reference; and\n\n- \u00b7  reviewing and approving 2023 non-audit services expenditure against policy and previously determined limit guidance. Reviewing and approving non-audit services limit guidance and expectations for 2024.\n\n## External audit scope, materiality and execution\n\nThe Committee discussed and agreed the scope of the audit with KPMG in May including the interim review plan (comprising audit testing, risk assurance procedures, process walkthroughs, control testing and data and analysis routines) and ensuring that the audit strategy was robust and informed by the auditor's assessment of the Group's key risks, particularly those that are significant to the audit. KPMG explained to the Committee the key tests that it intended performing on the identified higher-risk audit areas that could lead to material misstatement of the financial statements and significantly influenced the audit plan. The auditor and the Committee confirmed a shared understanding of these risks and key audit matters, including passenger revenue recognition, the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets and how these were to be considered in the audit approach. During the fourth quarter, KPMG confirmed that, as a result of the forecast Group trading results and the headroom on the annual impairment assessment, the risk of asset impairment was no longer considered to be a significant risk.\n\nThe auditor confirmed that 100% (2022: 99%) of the Group's forecast revenue and 95% (2022: 95%) of the Group's forecast total assets would be subject to a full scope audit. The Committee agreed, after challenging the external auditor as to whether such a high level of coverage was required, that the approach was appropriate and should provide the Board with a high level of assurance regarding the integrity of the financial statements and subsequently approved the audit plan, recognising that the plan would evolve\n\nas the year concluded to reflect any changes in circumstances or outlook.\n\nThe Committee agreed with KPMG, in considering the accuracy of financial reporting, the scale of accounting errors of lesser significance that were to be brought to the Committee's attention and the amounts that would need to be adjusted so that the financial statements give a true and fair view. The Committee agreed with the planning materiality based on the forecast results for 2023, which the Committee and the auditor kept under review during the final quarter of 2023 and the final stages of the 2023 audit.\n\n## External auditor quality and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee is very focused on audit quality and effectiveness, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure the rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. The Committee received updates from KPMG at five Committee meetings, enabling the Committee to assess and measure the quality of the audit through regularly monitoring the auditor's communications with management and the Committee, including discussion and challenge during Committee meetings, compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional guidance and assess, on an ongoing basis, the audit team's qualifications, expertise, resources, partner performance and the effectiveness of the audit process. The Committee's assessment included, in addition to its own independent assessment, a survey as well as detailed discussion with key executives and finance staff, which demonstrated that the 2023 external audit was deemed to be effective, robust and of good quality. The Committee's independent assessment considered the overall quality of the audit, including whether the auditor exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in its work and dealings with management and the independence of KPMG.",

        "page_content": "The Committee also assessed the depth of review and level of challenge provided by the external auditor over the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates made by management. The Committee felt that KPMG challenged management robustly on key judgements and estimates, accounting treatments and disclosures, for example in relation to loyalty programme revenue recognition where KPMG's challenge included an evaluation of the effectiveness of management's expert, the transition to a new expert and modelling. The observations and conclusion of the Committee in respect of this matter are noted in this report above.\n\nIn addition to the annual evaluation and regular review of reports to the Committee and observations and feedback on the working practices of the KPMG audit team, the Committee undertook an ongoing assessment of external audit quality and effectiveness including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n## External audit tender and transition 2021 2024\n\nKPMG first year of audit following the appointment approved by shareholders in 2020 for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 financial years\n\nKPMG reappointment to be considered and approved by shareholders for year to 31 December 2024 and annually thereafter\n\n- \u00b7  the Committee oversaw formal terms of engagement with the auditor and, after significant challenge by management as to the composition and quantum of the proposed fee increase, agreed the audit fee. KPMG assured the Committee that despite a significant increase compared with the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fee, the approved 2023 fee was at a level that was appropriate for the scope of the audit, to enable a quality audit to be undertaken;\n- \u00b7  reports from the external auditor were reviewed during all Committee meetings in 2023 and again in the February 2024 Committee meeting, covering: the conclusions of the review of the Group's results for the half year; audit planning updates; interim audit findings (including those of the review of the relevant key IT general controls); progress update for year end matters; and final report for year end matters;\n\n- \u00b7  KPMG attended all five of the planned Committee meetings during the year to answer any questions the Committee had outside these formal updates; and\n- \u00b7  consideration of the FRC's most recent Audit Quality Review conclusions relating to KPMG as a firm and any specific findings relating to audits led by the lead audit partners to IAG.\n\nTaking all aspects of the assessment throughout the year into consideration, the Committee concluded that it is satisfied that the KPMG audit was probing, challenging and robust and the approach provided a reliable audit opinion with a reasonable expectation of detecting material errors, irregularities and material fraud. The Committee considered the external audit to have been effective and of a high quality.\n\n## 2025\n\n## 2030\n\nMandatory appointment of new external (KPMG) audit Spanish lead partner to sign off on the 2026 financial year\n\nTo comply with the Spanish Act 22/2015, a competitive tender will be required for auditor appointment effective for the year to 31 December 2031 unless carried out earlier\n\nTo comply with the Spanish Act 22/2015, the Committee conducted an audit tender process that concluded in January 2020. Following KPMG's appointment (by shareholders) as the external auditor of the Company in 2020 for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Committee has reviewed and monitored the implementation of KPMG's transition and audit plans as well as the execution of these plans throughout 2023.

This report includes both: (i) our 2023 Annual Report on Remuneration, detailing how our current Directors' Remuneration Policy was implemented during 2023 and our proposed approach for 2024; and (ii) our proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy that is intended to apply from the date of our 2024 Annual General Meeting, in line with the three-year cycle in UK and Spanish remuneration regulations.\n\nIt has been an important year for IAG, in which the Group has continued its strong recovery after a very difficult period, delivering strong financial performance and having communicated our updated strategic and transformation plans to the market. In this context, the Committee continued to oversee the implementation of the Remuneration Policy during the period, focusing in particular on our\n\nexisting remuneration framework and its possible evolution in the short and medium term. In discharging its responsibilities, the Committee has remained mindful of the need to continue to attract, retain and incentivise our senior executives, in what has continued to be a dynamic and tight labour market, while consistently taking into account the wider experience of the workforce, our shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\n## Performance delivered in 2023\n\nIAG achieved strong operating profits as we continue to transform our businesses to deliver world-class operating margins and returns on invested capital. This result led to strong cash generation in the year, strengthening our balance sheet, with net leverage back within IAG's target range and improved credit ratings, and enabling us to invest in improving our customer experience.\n\nThe Group's performance has been against a background of continued uncertainty driven by the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\n\n- \u00b7  Operating profit before exceptional items \u20ac3,507 million;\n- \u00b7  Capacity recovered to 95.7% of 2019 levels and more than 115 million passengers flown;\n- \u00b7  Significantly strengthened our balance sheet, reducing gross debt by \u20ac3.9 billion by the end of the year;\n- \u00b7  This improved financial position has enabled us to invest in our customers and brands, in products, services, and IT, as well as adding 32 new fuelefficient aircraft to the fleet; and\n- \u00b7  Significant progress towards 2025 carbon efficiency target as IAG continues to lead the industry on sustainability\n\n## Workforce experience\n\nOur workforce is at the heart of what we do, and their hard work has again been key to the strong performance we have delivered this year. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees across the Group for their ongoing effort, flexibility, and commitment.\n\nOur financial performance has enabled us to invest more in our people, and we have continued to focus on making IAG a fair and rewarding place, where our people can develop and succeed. In 2023, our operating companies have made investments to improve colleague experience and our employee benefit packages. This includes enhanced flexible benefits offerings, mental and physical health offerings and financial wellbeing support.\n\nWith respect to workforce remuneration, across our operating companies, almost 90% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, many of which have been under review during 2023. Each operating company has sought to reach collective agreements which best support colleagues, whilst ensuring the business and pay remains competitive and sustainable.\n\nThe Committee has received regular updates on workforce experience and, in particular, on the steps the operating companies have taken to support colleagues both in terms of cost-of-living challenges, and their overall wellbeing. All of the members of the Committee participate in the Board workforce engagement programme and have also used this opportunity to engage with employees on remuneration matters.",

        "page_content": "The Committee has used these insights to ensure our decisions regarding executive remuneration take into account the approach taken across our workforce and reflect the expectations of all our stakeholders.\n\n## 2023 annual incentive outcome\n\nThere was no change to our annual incentive framework for 2023. 60% of the annual incentive was based on operating profit before exceptional items, 20% on customer NPS, 10% on carbon efficiency and 10% on strategic and personal objectives.\n\nThese measures were chosen to reflect the most important priorities of the Group for the year, with a focus on strong financial performance, delivering the best experience for our customers and the strategic importance of ESG and sustainability to the Group.\n\nThe Annual Incentive Plan operated in line with our Remuneration Policy and reflects the strong execution of our strategy in the year. Under the scorecard measures, the annual incentive outcome was 82.9% of the maximum opportunity. Whilst the outcome of our customer measure is below target, we performed well against our financial and carbon measures with both paying out at stretch performance. Customer continues to remain a key area of focus for both the management team and the Board. IAG is committed to provide a best-in-class customer experience and the Group will keep investing to further improve it. Full details of achievement against targets are provided in the variable pay outcomes section of this report.\n\n50% of the CEO's award will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## Vesting of the 2021 restricted share plan (RSP)\n\nThe first restricted share award was made in June 2021 and is due to vest in June 2024. In advance of this vesting, the Committee assessed the performance underpin which applies to the restricted share awards, taking into consideration IAG's overall financial and non-financial performance.\n\nAs part of this process, the Committee was presented with a framework for it to use in order to assess whether the performance underpin had been satisfied, taking into account the performance for the financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023. This incorporated detail on: IAG's financial performance (including revenue, profitability,\n\noperating margin, cash generation, return on capital, as well as performance relative to sector peers) and IAG's key non-financial and operational performance measures (including progress towards IAG's sustainability ambitions and its broader social agenda). The purpose of the framework was to ensure that the RSP vesting outcome can be justified and to guard against payment for failure.\n\nThe Committee agreed that, based on this assessment, the conditions set out in the underpin had been satisfied. As a result, it is expected that the 2021 RSP award for the IAG CEO will vest in full in June 2024. The estimated value of the award is included in the single total figure of remuneration in this year's report. The award is subject to a two-year holding period.\n\n## Remuneration Policy review\n\nIn line with the three-year policy cycle, our Directors' Remuneration Policy is due for renewal at our next Annual General Meeting in 2024.\n\nOur current Policy was developed at a time when the Group was significantly impacted by the biggest crisis the airline industry has ever faced. A key challenge for us at that time was to ensure that our remuneration framework remained effective in attracting and, crucially, retaining the executive talent necessary to drive the recovery of our business. In this context, and mindful of the challenge of setting long-term performance targets, we determined that the right approach for IAG was to introduce a restricted share plan, which would also allow our management team to focus on overcoming the crisis, while making the right decisions to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business.\n\nThe Committee has undertaken a thorough review of our existing Remuneration Policy during the year, considering the Group's strategic priorities, the macroeconomic environment, alternative remuneration frameworks and the effectiveness of the current Remuneration Policy; and concluded that the existing Policy continues to provide the most appropriate framework for aligning executive and shareholder interests at this time.\n\nWe believe that the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, as the industry continues to stabilise post COVID-19, creates a level of uncertainty and volatility that makes it very challenging to design and\n\nset appropriate long-term performance targets, while effectively incentivising and retaining our senior executives. In addition, the Committee is mindful of the fact that none of the awards under the Company's RSP have yet vested, with the first awards vesting in June 2024. As we continue to drive the recovery, we consider IAG's RSP will continue to ensure focus on the long-term health of our business and our strategic transformation agenda.\n\nWhile we propose to retain the current Directors' Remuneration Policy structure and framework, we are recommending some minor amendments to ensure that we remain competitive over the short term, the key change being the reduction of the annual incentive deferral from 50% to 20%, to apply only when the executive has met the shareholding guidelines (350% of salary for the IAG CEO). In this way, any reduction in deferral would only apply where an executive already has a substantial shareholding, therefore maintaining alignment with shareholder interests. The Committee also considers this change is more closely aligned with practice amongst our sector and Spanish peers, for whom bonus deferral is uncommon.\n\nOur proposed 2024 Directors' Remuneration Policy can be found at the end of this report.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nIn developing our approach to our Directors' Remuneration Policy review, we consulted with our major shareholders and main proxy advisory bodies. No concerns were raised with our Policy proposal, and we received valuable questions and feedback which will help shape our future discussions. I would like to thank all those shareholders who engaged with us during this process.\n\n## Implementation of the Policy in 2024 Base salary\n\nThe Committee seeks to ensure that the salary level for the IAG CEO is competitive in the context of a dynamic talent market in the geographies in which the Group operates and competes for talent. At the same time, the Committee is mindful of the current economic environment, the wider stakeholder experience, as well as investor and proxy advisor views. Following a detailed review, the Committee approved a salary increase of 4% for the IAG CEO for 2024. This is below the average increase for the wider workforce, which is more than 5%.",

        "page_content": "## Annual incentive\n\nIn 2024, IAG continues to face significant uncertainty and volatility driven by external factors. In this context, we have sought to ensure that the annual incentive plan continues to align with business priorities and reflect the underlying performance of the business.\n\nThe Committee has decided that the maximum annual incentive opportunity will remain at 200% of salary for the IAG CEO in line with the Policy, and that there will be no change to the performance measures for 2024, as the Committee believes the current measures continue to reflect the most important priorities of the Group for the year ahead. The targets for 2024 will be fully disclosed in next year's report.\n\n## Restricted share plan\n\nThe Group CEO will receive a restricted share award of 150% of salary in March 2024 under the existing Remuneration Policy. The award will vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of the discretionary performance underpin and will also be subject to a holding period until five years from grant.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe Committee will continue to review the economic and business context and consider any changes that might be appropriate to the Directors' Remuneration Policy in the coming years. We will consult with our major shareholders and the main proxy advisory bodies (and seek approvals as required) in the next three years, to the extent that changes are proposed. As the Group returns to strong sustainable performance, there may come a time when it becomes appropriate to incentivise IAG's management team to deliver our long-term financial and sustainability ambitions through robust long-term incentive targets. It is therefore our intention to keep our long-term incentive model under review to ensure that it remains effective.\n\nThis year the Remuneration Committee has again sought to take a responsible and considered approach to executive pay, taking into account the experience of our employees, shareholders and key stakeholders in the period. The Committee considers that the Directors' Remuneration Policy operated as intended during 2023, and the remuneration outcomes are fair and appropriate, considering the strong performance delivered in the year. I hope to receive your support for both our Remuneration Report and the renewal of our Remuneration Policy at our 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nApproved by the Board and signed on its behalf by\n\n## Heather Ann McSharry\n\nRemuneration Committee Chair",

The proposed policy can be found later in this report.\n\nAs a Spanish incorporated company, IAG is subject to Spanish corporate law. The Spanish legal regime regarding Directors' remuneration is substantially parallel to that of the UK as far as Directors' remuneration disclosure and approval requirements are concerned.\n\nThe Company welcomed the opportunity provided by the Spanish CNMV allowing companies to prepare free-format reports.

A copy of these Regulations is available on the Company's website.\n\nBeyond executive directors, the Committee oversees the general application of the Remuneration Policy for the members of the IAG Management Committee (and considers remuneration matters related to other senior managers and the broader workforce across the Group).\n\nArticle 32 of the Board Regulations ensures that the Remuneration Committee shall be made up of no fewer than three independent non-executive directors, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out their function. Heather Ann McSharry chairs the Committee and also holds Senior Independent Director responsibility. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided.\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.",

Deloitte reports directly to the Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during 2023 were \u00a3111,574 (\u20ac128,154), charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct. As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, other Deloitte teams provided advisory services to other parts of the Group in 2023. The Committee has reviewed the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent.\n\nIn addition to Deloitte providing the Remuneration Committee with market updates on pay themes, the Committee also received market data and insights from other specialist consultants such as Aon, PwC and Willis Towers Watson in 2023.",

The estimate is based on a three-month average share price from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2023 of 152 pence. Note that the value shown in this table differs from the value shown in the CNMV Statistical Annex accompanied to this report, as the reporting criteria established by the CNMV differ from those used in this table.\n\n## Additional explanations in respect of the single total figure table for 2023\n\nOnly the current IAG CEO, Luis Gallego, served as an executive director in 2023. As the sole executive director, the IAG CEO has confirmed in writing that he has not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than those already disclosed in the table above.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe values shown represent the actual salary paid to the IAG CEO for each performance year.\n\nJanuary 2022 marked the first point at which the IAG CEO received full contractual salary of \u00a3820,000 since appointment, following COVID-19 pandemic related salary reductions made since he assumed the CEO role, demonstrating the significant length of time pay reductions were in place.\n\nFor 2023, an increase of 4% was awarded, the first increase since appointment in 2020 and below the average increase for the wider workforce, which was more than 6%.\n\n## Taxable benefits\n\nTaxable benefits include the provision of a company car, a fuel allowance, executive support services and private health insurances.\n\nAs disclosed in our 2022 Directors' remuneration report, from January 2021 until December 2022 the IAG CEO was eligible for a transitionary allowance of \u00a3250,000 p.a. (gross), to reflect that as a result of his role he and his family now live in the UK. This allowance provided a two-year fixed period of transitionary support and considered that the IAG CEO continued to personally maintain a base in Madrid given the Company's significant operations and business in Spain. The value of the transitionary allowance was not included in the calculation of any pension, incentive or other benefit values. Payment of the transitionary allowance ceased in December 2022.\n\n## Pension-related benefits\n\nEmployer's contribution to pension scheme and/or cash in lieu of pension contribution.\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan\n\nFor our 2023 bonus, our scorecard was weighted to the following measures: 60% Operating profit (before exceptional items), 20% customer NPS, 10% carbon efficiency and 10% personal and strategic objectives.\n\nUnder those scorecard measures, the bonus outcome was 82.9% of maximum. The outcomes of the performance conditions which determined the award are described in detail later in the report.\n\nUnder the current policy, 50% of any Annual Incentive award for executive directors is made in deferred shares under the Executive Share Plan. Under this plan, shares are deferred for three years from date of grant.\n\nFor 2022, the bonus outcome was 83.5% of maximum. Half of the annual incentive was deferred into shares for three years; these will vest in March 2026.",

        "page_content": "## Long-term incentive vesting\n\nIn 2021 the existing performance share plan was replaced with a Restricted Share Plan (RSP). The first award was made to the IAG CEO in June 2021 and is due to vest in June 2024.\n\nThe Committee undertook an assessment of the performance underpin attached to the restricted share awards made in 2021 and agreed that, based on this assessment, the conditions set out in the underpin had been satisfied. As a result it is expected that the award will vest in full in June 2024.\n\nMore detail on the Committee's assessment can be found later on in the report.\n\n## Share price appreciation and depreciation\n\nThere is no value attributable to share price appreciation.\n\nThe Committee has not exercised any discretion as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation for any of the remuneration in the above table.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe Company provides life insurance and accidental death cover for executive directors. For the year ended 31 December 2023 the Company paid life insurance premium contributions of \u20ac17,050 (2022: \u20ac14,493).\n\n## Exchange rate for 2023\n\nFor the year to 31 December 2023, \u00a3:\u20ac exchange rate applied is 1.1486 (2022: 1.1744).\n\n## Variable pay outcomes\n\n## 2023 Annual Incentive Plan\n\nThe IAG Annual Incentive Plan supports the business strategy through incentivising the delivery of identified priorities within the reporting period. The composition of measures selected reflects the most important priorities for the Group for the year to deliver long-term sustainable returns. For 2023, the Board at the beginning of the year, following a recommendation by the Committee, set the following measures:\n\n| Weighting                                   | KPI                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 60% Financial                               | IAG Operating profit (before  exceptional items)           | For 2023 it was considered that Operating profit continued to  be the most appropriate financial KPI in aligning shareholder  interest with the Company                                                                                                                                    |\n| 20% Customer                                | Group Net Promoter Score by  relevance (NPS)               | NPS is used to gauge the loyalty and experience of the Group's  customer relationships.

The below table details the approved 2023 performance measures and the Board's assessment of both company and individual IAG CEO performance:\n\n|                     |                                         |           | Threshold                                | Target         | Stretch                             |                        | Payout % of                |                    |                                  |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Category            | Measure  type Operating                 | Weighting | At which  payments  begin (20%  pay-out) | (50%  pay-out) | Max  pay-out  (100%  pay-out) 2,727 | Performance  delivered | maximum  for each  measure | Weighted  Payout % | CEO  incentive  outcome  (\u00a3'000) |\n| Financial  measures | profit before  exceptional  items  (\u20acm) | 60%       | 1,469                                    | 2,098          |                                     | 3,507                  | 100%                       | 60%                | \u00a31,023                           |\n\n## Description of performance\n\nIn 2023, the Group benefited from its high-quality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, with recovery seen in all our businesses and with particular strength in Spain and the North and South Atlantic. Passenger capacity operated across the year was close to the levels operated in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and we were able to generate higher unit revenues than in 2019, which offset higher fuel costs and supplier cost inflation. The results was a strong operating profit before exceptional items for the year of \u20ac3,507 million, versus a target of \u20ac2,098 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                |       |     | 16.0   | 24.0   |   30.0 |     |      |     |\n|----------------|-------|-----|--------|--------|--------|-----|------|-----|\n| Customer  2023 | NPS 1 | 20% |        |        |  16.57 | 22% | 4.4% | \u00a375 |\n\n## Description of performance\n\nThe outcome for 2023 was 16.57 vs a target of 24.0. Disruptions, stemming from diverse factors such as air traffic control failures, strikes, adverse weather events, supply chain challenges, and baggage issues across key airports impacted negatively our NPS. To mitigate this impact our airlines responded proactively to these challenges through initiatives and transformation plans aimed at improving on-time performance and all baggage-related processes, among others. Positive impacts to our NPS can be attributed to substantial investment in our cabins and cabin product, the enhancement of food and drink offering, the effort to digitalise the customer journey, and the improvements in customer care. NPS continues to be a key area of focus for both management team and the Board.\n\n- 1 For the purpose of the annual incentive award, the weighting of each airline towards the overall NPS score reflects the Group's areas of focus for 2023.\n\n|        |      |          |     | 80.5   |      |      |     |      |\n|--------|------|----------|-----|--------|------|------|-----|------|\n| Carbon | 2023 | gCO2/pKm | 10% |        | 80.5 | 100% | 10% | \u00a3171 |\n\n## Description of performance\n\nThe outcome for 2023 was 80.5 vs a target of 82.0. IAG is targeting net zero emissions by 2050 across its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. IAG's interim targets are an 11% improvement in fuel efficiency 2019-2025, a 20% drop in net Scope 1 and 3 emissions 2019-30, and 10% SAF in 2030.\n\nIAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 and 2050 climate targets by carrying out emission reduction initiatives, working in collaboration with key stakeholders and proactively advocating for supportive government policy and technology development. Key measures to reduce emissions are fleet modernisation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), market-based measures including the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon removals.\n\n|                      |                                 |     | Low    | Good  to high   | Exceptional   |             |     |      |      |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-----|------|------|\n| Strategic            |                                 |     | (0% to | (45% to         | (70% to       |             |     |      |      |\n| and                  | As described in                 |     | 40%)   | 65%)            | 100%)         |             |     |      |      |\n| personal  objectives | the table in the  previous page | 10% |        |                 |               | Exceptional | 85% | 8.5% | \u00a3145 |\n\n## Description of performance\n\nThe Committee and the Board considered the CEO's performance against the KPIs set out on the previous page and assessed his performance against each of those indicators. The IAG CEO has led the group's recovery with passenger capacity close to prepandemic levels and with strong operating profits. He has led the transformation of IAG, strengthening IAG's position in core markets, delivering world-class operating margins and returns on invested capital. This result led to strong cash generation in the year, strengthening our balance sheet and with a clear plan and delivery against key transformation initiatives. This is a significant achievement particularly given the continued economic uncertainty and challenges faced across the year. The IAG CEO has also driven progress across the ESG agenda, increasing diversity and bench-strength of IAG's senior leadership, and making significant progress towards its 2025 carbon efficiency target.",

The simplified structure and transparency of the RSP in comparison to the Performance Share Plan, also provided a better basis to attract and retain senior management talent.\n\nA three-year vesting period and further two-year holding period applies to RSP awards for executive directors, with vesting being dependent upon a satisfactory review of the discretionary underpin by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions apply to RSP awards enabling the reduction of awards so far as nil value to further ensure that corporate or individual failure is not rewarded under the plan.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 Restricted Share Plan (RSP) award vesting\n\nThe first restricted share award was made in June 2021 and is due to vest in June 2024. In advance of the award vesting, the Committee undertook an assessment of the performance underpin which applies to the restricted share award and considers IAG's overall financial and non-financial performance.\n\nAs part of this process, the Committee was presented with a framework to assess whether the underpin had been satisfied, taking into account the overall performance for the financial years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The different elements considered included:\n\n- \u00b7  The overall financial results for the period including IAG's recovery from the pandemic. The Committee's assessment took into account overall profitability, operating margins (including against comparable airlines), revenue, cash generation, return on capital and the Company's investment in fleet, customer and transformation. The Committee was satisfied that the conditions of the underpin in this regard had been satisfied.\n- \u00b7  The Group's performance against key non-financial and operational performance measures, including progress towards IAG's sustainability ambitions and its broader social agenda (including diversity and inclusion). The Committee was satisfied that the conditions of the underpin in this regard had been satisfied.\n- \u00b7  IAG's risk context, where the Group's overall performance has been fundamentally in line with its approved risk appetite and internal control framework and no material issues have been identified.\n- \u00b7  The Group's wider stakeholder experience in the period, which does not give rise to any material concerns.\n\nThe purpose of the framework was to ensure that the RSP outcome can be justified and to guard against payment for failure. The Committee agreed that, based on this assessment, the conditions set out in the underpin had been satisfied. As a result, it is expected that the 2021 RSP award will vest in full in June 2024. The award is subject to a two-year holding period.\n\n| 2021 RSP (number of shares awarded)            | 414,954   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                                                | x         |\n| Estimated share price 1                        | \u00a31.5223   |\n|                                                | =         |\n| Award shown in the single figure table (\u00a3'000) | \u00a3632      |\n|                                                | \u20ac726      |\n\n- 1 Value shown represents the estimated value of the 2021 RSP award.

In assessing the underpin, the Committee will consider the Company's  overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures, as well as any material  risk or regulatory failures identified. Financial performance may include elements such as revenue,  profitability, cash generation, return on capital and benchmarked with comparable airlines.

This value is equivalent to 12.5% of base salary paid during the financial year and is comparable to the rate for the majority of the UK workforce.\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nIn order that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive directors are required to build up and maintain a minimum personal shareholding in the Company.\n\nUnder the Group's shareholding guidelines, the IAG CEO is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350% of salary and other executive directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 200% of basic salary.\n\nIn addition, executive directors are required to retain all shares received via incentive plans until 100% of their shareholding requirement is attained.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the IAG CEO's progress against the requirement and notes that he is compliant with the policy requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CEO, Luis Gallego   | Policy requirement   | 3.5 times salary                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                     | Actual               | 5.18 times salary (1,475,751 shares) |\n\nShares which qualify towards the Policy include shares already held by the executive, vested and exercised shares, vested and unexercised shares including those in the performance share plan holding period, vested shares in the restricted share plan holding period and unvested deferred annual incentive shares.\n\nThe chart and table below summarise current executive directors' interests as of 31 December 2023:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Executive  Director   | Shareholding  requirement   | Shares  owned   | Shares already  vested, or in the  holding period,  from performance  share plans   | Shares already  vested from  deferred annual  incentive plans   | Vested  shares from  restricted  share plan   | Unvested shares  from deferred  annual incentive  plans   | Total   qualifying shares held 1   | Consequence  of a +/- \u20ac0.5  share price  change (\u20ac)   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                       |                             |                 |                                                                                     |                                                                 |                                               |                                                           | 1,475,751                          |                                                       |\n| Luis                  | 350%                        |                 |                                                                                     |                                                                 |                                               |                                                           | (518% of                           |                                                       |\n| Gallego               | of salary                   | 403,834         | 557,207                                                                             | 277,619                                                         | 0                                             | 237,091                                                   | salary)                            | 737,875                                               |\n\nOn departure, executive directors will be required to hold the number of shares in line with their in-employment shareholding requirement (or the number of shares that they own at departure if lower) for two years from their date of termination from the Group.

Operating companies continue to support our people through these challenging times and ensure our pay models are sustainable, fair and aligned to the operating company's competitiveness.\n- \u00b7  Almost 90% of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with more than 30 collective bargaining agreements across the Group, many of them reviewed in 2023.\n- \u00b7  The Committee has received regular updates on workforce experience and in particular the steps the operating companies have taken to support colleagues both in terms of support with cost of living challenges, and their overall wellbeing.\n- \u00b7  This includes regular updates on the investments our operating companies have made in improving the colleague experience and our employee benefit schemes. This includes enhanced flexible benefits offerings (e.g. enhanced British Airways staff travel), mental health and physical health offerings (e.g. implementation of EAPs (employee assistance programmes) and free menopause support) and financial wellbeing support.\n- \u00b7  The Committee's insight into the experience of our colleagues helps to ensure that our decisions regarding executive remuneration take into account the approach taken across our workforce and reflect the expectations of all our stakeholders.\n\n## Engaging with employees Gender pay\n\n## Workforce remuneration\n\nAll members of the Remuneration Committee participate as designated directors in the Board workforce engagement plan. This engagement also includes remuneration and other workforce experience matters relevant to the Committee.\n\nThe key themes from the engagement were shared with the Board in order to understand colleague experiences and to identify any areas for improvement. Further explanations of the Board engagement with employees is set out in the Stakeholders engagement section of the Corporate Governance report.\n\nOperating companies have implemented a range of initiatives to support gender equality including reviewing recruitment processes to ensure diverse shortlists and interview panels, setting up mentoring and networking opportunities to women and providing educational programmes for girls and young women considering career paths in aviation.\n\nAs the Group built back resources during 2023, in particular in airport operations, customer and IT roles, the composition of the workforce has changed, with the resultant median pay point for both men and women changing compared to 2022. The result is that at Group level, there has been a year-on-year reduction in the median salary gap from 12.9% in 2022 to 8.4% in 2023.\n\nEach operating company has sought to reach collective agreements that best support colleagues whilst ensuring the business and pay remains competitive. This has included changes in allowances, one-off payments and contractual pay increases throughout the Group.\n\nEach operating company is committed to creating a positive working environment but also to actively contribute to and support the overall wellbeing of every colleague through the provision of a comprehensive range of health, financial, and lifestyle benefits.\n\nRemuneration decisions made by the Committee align with our strategy, our stakeholders' interest in our delivery of long-term sustainable value and with the wider workforce in line with the principles set out in our policy.",

UK employee pay is based on the payroll records of 40,248 employees who were in the Group for the whole of or some of 2023.\n- 2  To ensure the accuracy of these calculations, earnings data were collected directly from the UK payroll on a month-by-month basis. Any variable incentive elements in respect of 2023, payable to employees later in 2024, are modelled on an employee-by-employee basis against agreed frameworks. This approach enables fair and accurate comparison to the IAG CEO 2023 single total figure of remuneration.\n- 3  To provide a fair and representative view to all remuneration received by UK employees, the 2021 basic salary and total remuneration figures include statutory and company top-up furlough payments. With the UK furlough scheme having ended in September 2021, this consideration is not relevant for 2022 or 2023.\n- 4  The 2020 UK employee remuneration figures excluded all types of furlough payment and were representative of earnings for time worked but were not representative of the full level of pay received by employees and their actual remuneration experience.\n\nThe comparison in the ratio versus 2019 demonstrates the continuing impact of the pandemic and is an accurate reflection of the contraction in IAG CEO's pay, with the IAG CEO's remuneration currently being around 96% of 2019 levels.\n\nThe increase in the UK employee remuneration in 2023 reflects:\n\n- \u00b7  Across our operating companies we have put in place a number of programmes to support our people through the current economic uncertainty.\n- \u00b7  Payments made to managers under the 2023 annual incentive plan.\n- \u00b7  Changes to the size and composition of the UK workforce between years, with pay for 36,474 employees being reported for 2022 and 40,248 for 2023.\n\nThe change in the IAG CEO's remuneration between 2022 and 2023, is due to:\n\n- \u00b7  An increase of 4% in basic salary for 2023, first increase since appointment in 2020 and below the average increase of the wider workforce (with no increase in 2021 and 2022, 10% reduction in 2021 and 20% reduction in 2020).\n- \u00b7  The inclusion of an estimated value of the 2021 RSP award, that is estimated to vest in full in June 2024.\n- \u00b7  As disclosed in our 2022 Director's Remuneration Report, from January 2021 until December 2022 the Executive Director was eligible for a transitionary allowance of \u00a3250,000 p.a., to reflect that as a result of his role as IAG CEO, he and his family moved to live in the UK. This allowance provided a two-year fixed period of transitionary support. Payment of the transitionary allowance ceased in December 2022.\n\nThe Committee recognises that the current ratio continues to reflect recovery from the pandemic, and will continue to increase to a more representative level.",

Additionally, no award was made for 2021 (March 2022), as the IAG's CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 Annual Incentive Award, waiving any 2021 incentive opportunity.\n\n| Executive Director   | Performance  year award  relates to 1   | Date of award   | Number of  Shares at  1 January  2023   | Awards  released  during  the year   | Date of vesting   | Awards  lapsing  during  the year   | Awards  made  during  the year   | Number of  unvested  shares at  31 December  2023   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | 2019                                    | 6 March 2020    | 81,520                                  | 81,520                               | 6 March 2023      | -                                   | -                                | -                                                   |\n| Luis Gallego         | 2022                                    | 13 March 2023   | 447,341                                 | -                                    | 13 March 2026     | -                                   | -                                | 447,341                                             |\n| Total                |                                         |                 | 528,861                                 | 81,520                               |                   | -                                   | -                                | 447,341                                             |\n\nUnder the Executive Share Plan rules an IADP will not lapse on leaving employment before the vesting date unless exceptional circumstances occur, such as gross misconduct, in which case the award would lapse in full. IADP awards are also subject to the policy's malus and clawback provisions.\n\nThe values attributed to the Company's ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules for IADP awards (relating to the previous year's performance) were 2020 award: 459 pence; and 2023 award: 153 pence.\n\nThe share price on the date of the vesting of the 2020 IADP award (6 March 2023) was 155 pence. The monetary value of the shares received was the share price on the date of the vesting multiplied by the number of shares in respect of the award vested, as shown in the table above.",

In line with the three-year cycle in UK and Spanish remuneration regulations we will be submitting a new Directors' Remuneration Policy which will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 2024 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The proposed policy can be found below.\n\n## 2024 Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThis section sets out the Directors' Remuneration Policy of International Consolidated Airlines Group which will be put to shareholder approval at the 2024 Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThis Directors' Remuneration Policy is adapted to the wording of article 529 novodecies of the Capital Companies Act, as amended by Law 5/2021 of 12 April, and shall apply, in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of said article 529 novodecies, from the date of its approval by the 2024\n\nShareholders' Meeting and during the following three financial years. Any amendment or replacement thereof during such period shall require the prior approval of the Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with the procedure established for its approval.\n\nAlthough IAG, as a Spanish-incorporated company, is not subject to the remuneration reporting regulations that apply to UK-incorporated companies, it is firmly committed to UK best practice and will continue to operate in accordance with the UK remuneration reporting regulations.\n\nIn developing the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy, input was received from the Remuneration Committee and management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were suitably mitigated. Input was also provided by the Remuneration Committee's appointed independent advisers throughout the process.\n\n## IAG Remuneration Principles\n\n| Alignment              | Our remuneration policies promote long-term value creation, through transparent alignment  with our corporate strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Simplicity and clarity | We will keep our remuneration structures as simple and clear as possible to ensure they are  understandable and meaningful to employees and shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Competitiveness        | Total remuneration will be competitive for the role, taking into account scale, sector,  complexity of responsibility and geography.

        "page_content": "## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe Company consults regularly with its major investors on all matters relating to executive remuneration. The Company will engage in an extensive investor consultation exercise whenever there are any significant changes to remuneration policy.\n\nIn developing our approach to our Director's Remuneration Policy review, we consulted with our major shareholders and main proxy advisory bodies. No concerns were raised with our Policy proposal, and we received valuable questions and feedback which will help shape our future discussions.\n\nThe Committee discusses each year the issues and outcomes from the annual Shareholders' Meeting, and determines any appropriate action required as a result.\n\n## Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group\n\nThe Committee is updated on pay and conditions of the employees within the Group and takes this into account when considering executive directors' remuneration. The Board is committed to understanding the experience of all our employees and uses its insight to ensure all decisions regarding executive remuneration reflect the experience and expectations of all stakeholders.\n\nThe pay of employees across all companies in the Group is taken into account when determining the level of any increase in the annual salary review of directors. This normally takes place each year at the January Committee meeting.\n\nWhen determining the RSP awards for executive directors, the Committee takes note of the eligibility criteria and the potential size of awards for executives below director level in all companies within the Group.\n\nAt the operating company level, the Company consults with employee representative bodies, including trade unions and works councils. This includes consultation on company strategy, the competitive environment, and employee terms and conditions. In addition, some of the operating companies run employee opinion surveys in order to take into consideration employee views on a variety of subjects, including leadership, management, and the wider employee experience.\n\nThe IAG European Works Council (EWC) facilitates communication and consultation between employees and management on transnational European matters. It includes representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) countries, meeting regularly throughout the year to be informed and where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters impacting employees in two or more EEA countries.\n\n## Proposed changes to Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nAfter a detailed review of the current Directors' Remuneration Policy the Committee has concluded that the existing policy continues to provide the most appropriate framework for aligning executive and shareholder interests at this current time. As IAG returns to strong sustainable performance, the Committee believes there will be a time when it is appropriate to incentivise our CEO and his team to deliver our long-term financial and sustainability ambitions through robust long-term incentive targets. It is therefore our intention to keep our long-term incentive model under review to ensure that it continues to remain effective. We will consult with shareholders (and seek approvals as required) in the next three years to the extent that any changes are proposed.\n\nWhile we propose to retain the current Directors' Remuneration Policy structure and framework, the Committee is proposing some minor Policy amendments to ensure that we remain competitive over the short term, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7  Approach to annual bonus deferral: under our 2021 remuneration policy, any annual bonus earned is paid 50% in cash, with 50% deferred into shares for three years. This deferral has been an important way of increasing personal shareholdings and satisfying the Group's minimum shareholding requirements of 350% of salary for the CEO. Recognising that our control mechanism for ensuring alignment with shareholder interests is the minimum shareholding requirement itself, and that the minimum shareholding requirement can be fully met without the reliance on annual bonus deferral, under our 2024 remuneration policy the Committee is proposing that the bonus deferral is rebalanced from 50% to 20% of any annual bonus earned deferred into shares, subject to the executive meeting their minimum shareholding requirement. The remaining 80% of the annual bonus earned will be paid in cash. The deferral rate will remain at 50% until the minimum shareholding requirement is met; and\n- \u00b7  If a broad-based employee share plan is implemented, Executive Directors will be able to participate on the same basis as other employees.\n\nThe Policy as shown on the following pages is intended to apply for three years, until 2027, taking effect from the date of approval.",

The share price used to calculate the guideline is either the share price on the date of award or on the date of vesting/exercise. Executive directors will be required to retain the entire 100% of shares (net of tax) which vest from share plans until their respective shareholding requirement is attained. The IAG CEO is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350% of basic salary, and other executive directors (to the extent they are appointed to the Board) are required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 200% of basic salary.\n\nOn departure, executive directors will be required to hold the number of shares in line with their in-employment shareholding requirement (or the number of shares that they own at departure if lower) for two years from the date they step down from the Board. Shares will normally be retained in the nominee account administered by the Company to ensure this.\n\n## Choice of performance measures\n\nThe performance measures selected for the annual bonus are ordinarily set on an annual basis by the Committee, to ensure that they remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the Company in the year ahead. The targets for the performance measures are set taking into account a number of factors, including the Company's annual operating plan, strategic priorities, the economic environment and market conditions and expectations. Non-financial annual bonus measures may include strategic, personal, customer and ESG objectives.\n\n## Malus and clawback provisions\n\n| Malus and  clawback  provisions   | Circumstances   | The Board, following the advice of the Committee, has authority to reduce or cancel awards  before they are satisfied (and/or impose additional conditions on awards), and to recover  payments, if special circumstances exist.

This includes where the business has had an exceptional event, in particular events that significantly impact stakeholders. This will include analysing the performance of the participant and the underlying financial performance of the Group to check whether they have been satisfactory in the circumstances and whether vesting levels reflect overall corporate performance. The Remuneration Committee can also take other factors it considers relevant into account. Underlying financial performance is defined as the overall performance of\n\nthe Company, which may be considered with reference to a range of measures as the Remuneration Committee considers most appropriate at the time. Stakeholders would include shareholders, customers, and the Company's workforce. The Board also has authority to reduce the award levels at grant and/or the vesting outcomes for the RSP where the Company has experienced a significant fall in share price, as a result of which it considers that participants have unduly benefited from windfall gains.\n\n## Benefits, expenses and taxation\n\nThe Board may arrange to settle any taxes and associated expenses payable if it deems such settlement appropriate, including, but not limited to tax on benefits or where, without such settlement, the executive will be subject to double taxation on the same remuneration amount.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nThe table below summarises the main elements of remuneration for non-executive directors:\n\n| Purpose and   link to strategy                                                                                     | Operation of element of policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Maximum opportunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basic fees Fees take into  account the level of  responsibility,  experience, abilities  and dedication  required. | Fees are normally set with reference to factors such as market  positioning.

        "page_content": "## Service contracts and exit payments policy Executive directors\n\nThe following is a description of the key terms of the service contracts of executive directors.\n\nThe service contracts are available for inspection, on request, at the Company's registered office.\n\nThe contracts of executive directors are for an indefinite period.\n\nThere are no express provisions in executives' service contracts with the Company for compensation payable upon termination of those contracts, other than for payments in lieu of notice.\n\n| Executive director   | Date of contract   | Notice period     |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Luis Gallego         | 8 September 2020   | 12 months - given |\n\nThe period of notice required from the executive is six months; the period of notice required from the Company is 12 months. Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a payment becomes payable only if, in the Company's opinion, the executive has taken reasonable steps to find alternative paid work and then only in monthly instalments. The payments will comprise base salary only. The Company may reduce the sum payable in respect of any month by any amount earned by the executive (including salary and benefits) referable to work done in that month (for example, as a result of alternative paid work referred to above).\n\nIn the event of an executive's redundancy, compensation, whether in respect of a statutory redundancy payment or a payment in lieu of notice or damages for loss of office, is capped at an amount equal to 12 months' base salary. The Company will honour the contractual entitlements of a terminated director; however, the Company may terminate an executive's service contract with immediate effect and without compensation on a number of grounds including where the executive is incapacitated for 130 days in any 12-month period, becomes bankrupt, fails to perform his or her duties to a reasonable standard, acts dishonestly, is guilty of misconduct or persistent breach of his or her duties, brings the Company into disrepute, is convicted of a criminal offence, is disqualified as a director, refuses to agree to the transfer of his or her service contract where there is a transfer of the business in which he or she is working or ceases to be eligible to work in Spain or the UK (as applicable).\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any other payments (including, for example, appropriate legal or outplacement fees) in connection with an executive director's cessation of office or employment where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of an executive director's office or employment.\n\nUnder any of the Company's share plans, save in respect of bonus deferral awards (which will normally vest in full following cessation for any reason) if a director leaves, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, may exercise its discretion (within the rules of the schemes) to grant good leaver status. This can be granted in certain circumstances including for example (list not exhaustive) the director leaving for reasons of ill-health, injury or disability, redundancy, retirement or death. Executive directors leaving with good leaver status will normally receive a pro-rata amount of their RSP shares, subject to the underpin being met, in accordance with the plan rules. The pro-ration is normally calculated according to what proportion of the vesting period the executive director spent in company service. Normal vesting dates, holding periods, and post-cessation shareholding guidelines will normally continue to apply, other than in a limited number of exceptional circumstances in accordance with plan rules and/or at the discretion of the Board. If good leaver status is not granted to an executive director, all outstanding awards made to them will normally lapse.\n\nExecutive directors leaving with good leaver status are eligible to receive a pro-rata annual incentive payment for the period of the year actually worked, subject to the regular performance assessment and normally paid in the normal manner following the year end.\n\nIn the event of an executive director's termination from the Company, they must not be employed by, or provide services to, a restricted business (i.e. an airline or travel business that competes with the Company) for a period of 12 months.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nNon-executive directors (including the Chair) do not have service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Board Regulations and the Company's Bylaws. They do not have the right to any compensation in the event of termination as directors. Board members shall hold office for a period of one year. The non-executive directors' letters of appointment are available for inspection, on request, at the Company's registered office.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the policy tables\n\nThe Board may make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (and exercise any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) which are not in line with this remuneration policy, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before this policy came into effect (provided that they were in line with any applicable directors' remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed) or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and such payment was not, in the Board's opinion, in consideration of the individual becoming a director. For these purposes 'payments' include the Board satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in respect of a share award, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted. The Board may also make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside of the policy set out above if such payments are required by law in a relevant country.\n\n## Common award terms\n\nAwards granted under the share plans may be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company's share capital or any demerger, special dividend or other event that may affect the current or future value of the awards.\n\n## External non-executive directorship\n\nThe Company's consent is required before an executive can accept an external non-executive appointment and permission is only given in appropriate circumstances. The Company allows the executive to retain any fee from such appointments.\n\n## Approach to recruitment remuneration\n\nThe remuneration for new executive directors will be in line with the policy for current executive directors as far as possible, as expressed in the policy table earlier in this report.\n\nOn appointment, new executive directors will have their basic salary set by taking into account factors such as the external market, their peers, and their level of experience. New executive directors will participate in the annual and long-term incentives on the same basis as existing directors.\n\nTo facilitate recruitment, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Committee, may make one-off awards to buy out a candidate's remuneration arrangements that are forfeited as a result of joining the Company. Generally, such buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited giving due regard to all relevant factors (including value, performance targets, the likelihood of those targets being met and vesting periods). In such circumstances, shareholders will be provided with full details and rationale in the next published remuneration report.\n\nExcluding the value of any potential buy-out, the maximum value of variable remuneration offered at recruitment will be no more than the maxima shown in the remuneration policy table.\n\nIn the case of an internal promotion to executive director, the Company will continue to honour any commitments made before promotion.\n\nOther than that, the remuneration arrangements on recruitment will be as above.\n\nNon-executive directors recruited will be remunerated in line with the Company's remuneration policy principles outlined before.",

Accordingly, for the year to 31 December 2022, the Group has reclassified \u20ac22 million of gains from Other non-operating credits to Net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment within Expenditure on operations. There is no impact on the Profit after tax. The segmental operating profit/(loss) has been updated to reflect the reclassification.\n\n## Statement of other comprehensive income\n\nThe prior year Statement of other comprehensive income includes a reclassification of \u20ac173 million of gains associated with the fair value movements on cash flow hedges and \u20ac9 million of losses associated with the fair value movements on cost of hedging, which had been previously presented under the sub-heading Items that will not be reclassified to net profit, to the sub-heading Items that may be reclassified subsequently to net profit, as these may recycle to net profit in future periods. There is no impact on Total other comprehensive (loss)/income for the year, net of tax.\n\n## Cash flow statement\n\nThe prior year Cash flow statement has been represented and further detailed in note 37. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified the results for the year to 31 December 2022.\n\n## Going concern\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had total liquidity of \u20ac11,624 million (31 December 2022: total liquidity of \u20ac13,999 million), comprising cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac6,837 million, \u20ac4,412 million of committed and undrawn general facilities and a further \u20ac375 million of committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities. At 31 December 2023, the Group has no financial covenants associated with its loans and borrowings.\n\nThe decrease in liquidity during the year to 31 December 2023 was attributable to, amongst other actions: (i) the repayment of borrowings of \u20ac4,268 million, which consisted of, amongst others, the \u20ac2,330 million (\u00a32.0 billion) early repayment of the UK Export Finance (UKEF) Credit Facility, the \u20ac867 million of early repayment of the syndicated financing agreement, partially guaranteed by Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) in Spain and the \u20ac500 million redemption of the senior unsecured bond at maturity; (ii) securing an additional five-year Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac1,159 million (\u00a31.0 billion), offset by a reduction in aircraft specific facilities of \u20ac741 million; and (iii) offset by strong operational cash flow generation.\n\nIn its assessment of going concern, the Group has modelled two scenarios referred to below as the Base Case and the Downside Case over the period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of these consolidated financial statements (the 'going concern period'). The Group's three-year business plan, used in the creation of the Base Case, was prepared for and approved by the Board in December 2023. The business plan takes into account the Board's and management's views on capacity, based on the potential impact of the wider economic and geopolitical environments on the Group's businesses across the going concern period. The key inputs and assumptions underlying the Base Case through to 31 March 2025, include:\n\n- \u00b7 capacity recovery modelled by geographical region with total capacity to remain above the levels obtained in 2023 throughout the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 passenger unit revenue per ASK is forecast to remain above the levels obtained in 2023 throughout the going concern period;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the committed and undrawn general facilities of \u20ac4,412 million will not be drawn over the going concern period. The availability of certain of these facilities reduces over time, with \u20ac3,843 million being available to the Group at 31 March 2025;\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the undrawn aircraft facilities of \u20ac375 million, relating to specific financing structures, will be utilised over the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the \u20ac500 million bond that matures in March 2025 will not be refinanced;\n- \u00b7 of the capital commitments detailed in note 15, \u20ac3,207 million is due to be paid over the period to 31 March 2025;\n- \u00b7 while the Group does not expect to finance all expected deliveries over the going concern period, for those it does expect to finance, it has forecast securing between 90 and 100 per cent depending on aircraft type, or \u20ac2,235 million, of the aircraft financing that is currently uncommitted, to align with the timing and payments for those aircraft deliveries it expects to finance, including aircraft delivered in 2023 that had not had their financing secured at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 the Group has assumed that the relevant approvals required in relation to the acquisition of the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings that it does not currently own are obtained by the end of the going concern period, and that cash outflows of \u20ac149 million will be incurred, comprising \u20ac100 million of the cash consideration and \u20ac49 million for the purchase of ordinary shares in the Company that have not already been purchased at the balance sheet date. The deferred consideration of \u20ac100 million to be paid on the first anniversary and the \u20ac100 million to be paid on the second anniversary of the completion of the acquisition are assumed to occur outside of the going concern period and accordingly not included in these forecasts.\n\nThe Downside Case applies stress to the Base Case to model adverse commercial and operational impacts over the going concern period, represented by: reduced levels of capacity operated in each month, including reductions of 25 per cent for three months over the going concern period; reduced passenger unit revenue per available seat kilometre (ASK); increases in the price of jet fuel by 20 per cent above that assumed in the Base Case; and increased operational costs. In the Downside Case, over the going concern period capacity would be 10 per cent down when compared to the Base Case. The Downside Case assumes that British Airways would be required to draw down, in full, its portion of the available US dollar Revolving Credit Facility (further information given in notes 3 and 29f). The Downside Case also assumes that upon completion of the Air Europa Holdings acquisition, a further \u20ac200 million of working capital needs are funded by the Group. The Directors consider the Downside Case to be a severe but plausible scenario.\n\nHaving reviewed the Base Case and the Downside Case, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each made up to 31 December together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates and joint ventures, adjusted where appropriate to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration paid is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated balance sheet. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, as at the acquisition date the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the Income statement.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nAll intragroup account balances, including intragroup profits, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and leaseback transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. In certain instances, the Group will undertake several such sale and leaseback transactions at once through Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). Under each of these financing structures, a company or companies (the EETC Issuer) are established to facilitate such financing on behalf of a number of unrelated investors. In certain of these financing structures, additional special purpose vehicles (the Lessor SPV) are established to provide additional financing from a number of further unrelated investors to the EETC Issuer. The proceeds from the issuance of the EETCs by the EETC Issuer, and where relevant the proceeds obtained from the Lessor SPV, are then used to purchase aircraft solely from the Group. The Group will then enter into fixed rate lease arrangements (which meet the recognition criteria of Asset financed liabilities) with the EETC Issuer, or where relevant the Lessor SPV, with payments made by the Group to the EETC Issuer, or the Lessor SPV, distributed, through a trust, to the aforementioned unrelated investors. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the credit-worthiness of the Group's debt obligations through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower the Group's total borrowing cost.\n\nThe EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are established solely with the purpose of providing the asset-backed financing and upon maturity of such financing are expected to have no further activity. The relevant activities of the EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are restricted to pre-established financing agreements and the retention of the title of the associated financed aircraft. Accordingly, the Group has determined that each EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPVs are structured entities. Under the contractual terms of the financing structures, the Group has no exposure to losses in these entities, does not own any of the share capital of the EETC Issuer or the Lessor SPV, does not have any representation on the respective boards and has no ability to influence decision-making.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nIn addition to the above, such financial transactions expose the Group to no further significant financial or economic risks, such as no variability over time in interest rates.\n\nIn considering the aforementioned facts, management has concluded that the Group does not have access to variable returns from the EETC Issuers and Lessor SPVs because its involvement is limited to the payment of principal and interest under the arrangement and, therefore, it does not control the EETC Issuers or the Lessor SPVs and as such does not consolidate them.\n\nFurther information as to the financial impact of these financial transactions is given in note 26.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with how resource allocation decisions are made by the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the IAG Management Committee.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\n## a Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In particular, British Airways and IAG Loyalty have a functional currency of pound sterling. The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\n## b Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities classified as non-current on the Balance sheet are recognised within Net currency retranslation credits/(charges) in the Income statement. All other gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in operating profit.\n\n## c Group companies\n\nThe net assets of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses of such operations are translated into euros at average rates of exchange during the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity (Currency translation reserve) until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are held at cost. The Group has a policy of not revaluing property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis, over the economic life of the asset. Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market values for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.\n\n## a Fleet\n\nAll aircraft are stated at the fair value of the consideration given after taking account of manufacturers' credits and pre-delivery instalment payments (referred to as progress payments). Fleet assets owned or right of use ('ROU') assets are disaggregated into separate components and depreciated at rates calculated to write down the cost of each component to the estimated residual value at the end of their planned operational lives (which is the shorter of their useful life or lease term) on a straight-line basis. Depreciation rates are specific to aircraft type, based on the Group's fleet plans, within overall parameters of 23 years and up to 5 per cent residual value for short-haul aircraft and between 23 and 29 years (depending on aircraft) and up to 5 per cent residual value for long-haul aircraft.\n\nRight of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the aforementioned depreciation rates. Where the lease includes a purchase option, at the discretion of the Group, where it is expected that the purchase option will be exercised, the associated right of use asset is depreciated using the aforementioned depreciation rates to reflect the reasonably certain life of the aircraft, irrespective of the lease term.\n\nCabin interior modifications, including those required for brand changes and relaunches, are depreciated over the lower of 12 years and the remaining economic life of the aircraft, whether owned or leased.\n\nAircraft and engine spares acquired on the introduction or expansion of a fleet, as well as rotable spares purchased separately, are carried as property, plant and equipment and generally depreciated in line with the fleet to which they relate.\n\n## b Other property, plant and equipment\n\nProvision is made for the depreciation of all property, plant and equipment. Property, with the exception of freehold land, is depreciated over its expected useful life over periods not exceeding 50 years, or in the case of leasehold properties, over the duration of the lease if shorter, on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from four to 20 years.\n\n## c Capitalisation of interest on progress payments\n\nInterest costs attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the year in which they are incurred.",

        "page_content": "## d Liquidated damages\n\nCertain of the Group's contractual arrangements with aircraft and engine manufacturers contain liquidated damage clauses, whereby if the supplier breaches one or more contractual clauses (such as delays in the timing of delivery of an aircraft or engine) then damages are payable to the Group. Liquidated damages are recognised in the Income statement only to the extent that they relate to compensation for loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, when a contractual entitlement exists, the amounts can be reliably measured and the receipt is virtually certain. When liquidated damages do not relate to compensation for loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, the amounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of the associated aircraft in the Balance sheet and depreciated over the life of the aircraft.\n\nWhen compensation, not related to the loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, is received in advance of the associated delivery of the aircraft and/or engine, the Group recognises the amount within Other creditors until such time as the aircraft and/or engine is delivered, at which time the amounts are transferred and recorded as a reduction in the cost of the associated asset. Such compensation is recorded in the Cash flow statement within cash flows from investing activities under the caption of Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\n## e Leases\n\nThe Group leases various aircraft, properties, equipment and other assets. The lease terms of these assets are consistent with the determined useful economic life of similar assets within property, plant and equipment.\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified tangible asset for a period in exchange for consideration. The Group has elected not to apply such consideration where the contract relates to an intangible asset, such as for landing rights or IT software, in which case payments associated with the contract are expensed as incurred.\n\nLeases are recognised as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nAt the lease commencement date a ROU asset is measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and any initial direct costs. In addition, at the lease commencement date a ROU asset will incorporate unavoidable restoration costs, such as the removal of airline-specific branding and configuration, to return the asset to its original condition, for which a corresponding amount is recognised within Provisions. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If ownership of the ROU asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at their present value, which includes the following lease payments: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option; and payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\n\nAircraft lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is the discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value to be equal to the fair value of the leased asset and any initial indirect costs of the lessor. For aircraft leases these inputs are either observable in the contract or readily available from external market data. The initial direct costs of the lessor are considered to be immaterial. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the Group entity's incremental borrowing rate is used.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability for each period. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease contract, a re-assessment of the lease term (specifically in regard to assumptions regarding extension and termination options) and changes in variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate.\n\n## Amounts excluded from recognition as lease liabilities\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and those leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, that do not contain a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is re-assessed and adjusted against the ROU asset. Extension options are included in a number of aircraft, property and equipment leases across the Group and are reflected in the lease payments where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Such variable lease payments are expensed to the Income statement as incurred.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and lease transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each transaction is assessed as to whether it meets the criteria within IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for a sale to have occurred. The principal criterion for assessing whether a sale has occurred or not, is whether the contract contains the option, at the discretion of the Group, to repurchase the aircraft over the lease term; with the existence of such a repurchase option resulting in a sale having been deemed not to have occurred; and if no such repurchase option exists, then a sale is deemed to have occurred. The following defines the accounting for such transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 if a sale is determined to have occurred, then the associated asset is de-recognised and a ROU asset and lease liability are recognised. The ROU asset recognised is based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that is retained. Any gain or loss is restricted to the amount that relates to the rights that have been transferred to the counterparty to the transaction; and\n- \u00b7 where a sale is determined to have not occurred, the asset is retained on the Balance sheet within Property, plant and equipment and an Asset financed liability recognised equal to the financing proceeds.\n\n## Cash flow presentation - lease liabilities\n\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:\n\n- \u00b7 where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions represent the fair value of the asset being transferred, the total proceeds are presented within cash flows from investing activities. Where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions exceed the fair value of the asset being transferred, the element of the proceeds equivalent to the fair value of the asset being transferred is presented within investing activities and the amount of proceeds in excess of the fair value is presented within financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the repayments of the principal element of lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the payments of the interest element of lease liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities; and\n- \u00b7 the payments arising from variable elements of a lease, short-term leases and low-value assets are presented within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Cash flow presentation - asset financed liabilities\n\nPayments associated with asset financed liabilities are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:\n\n- \u00b7 the proceeds received from asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities;\n- \u00b7 the repayments of the principal element of asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; and\n- \u00b7 the payments of the interest element of asset financed liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nFrom time to time the Group will lease, to third parties, specific assets, including certain property, plant and equipment. On inception of the lease, the Group determines whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nIn order to make this determination, the Group assesses whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Factors in making this assessment include, but are not limited to, whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset and whether the underlying asset transfers to the lessee or the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, then the lease is recorded as a finance lease, otherwise it is recorded as an operating lease.\n\n## f Maintenance, repairs and overhaul\n\n## Owned aircraft\n\nMajor overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs for airframes and engines, is capitalised and amortised over the expected life between major overhauls or to the end of the useful life of the asset.\n\nAll other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of owned fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 'pay-as-you-go' contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.\n\n## Leased aircraft\n\nThe Group records a provision for major maintenance and overhaul events, including for airframes and engines, that occur through usage or through the passage of time that is recognised as such activity occurs through to the next maintenance event, with a corresponding expense recorded in the Income statement. Any subsequent changes in estimation are recognised in the Income statement. When the maintenance and/or overhaul event occurs, the associated provision is de-recognised.\n\nRestoration and handback obligations that arise on the inception of a lease are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the ROU asset. Any subsequent change in estimation relating to such costs are reflected in the ROU asset.\n\nAll other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of leased fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 'pay-as-you-go' contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.",

Where the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is in excess of the consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the Income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment, goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## b Brands\n\nBrands arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Long established brands that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## c Customer loyalty programmes\n\nCustomer loyalty programmes arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. A customer loyalty programme with an expected useful life is amortised over the expected remaining useful life. Established customer loyalty programmes that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## d Landing rights\n\nLanding rights acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Landing rights acquired from other airlines are capitalised at cost.\n\nCapitalised landing rights based outside of the UK and the EU are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years. Capitalised landing rights based within the UK and the EU are not amortised, as regulations provide that these landing rights are perpetual.\n\n## e Contract-based intangibles\n\nContract-based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over the remaining life of the contract.\n\n## f Software\n\nThe cost to purchase or develop computer software that is separable from an item of related hardware is capitalised separately and amortised on a straight-line basis generally over a period not exceeding five years, with certain specific software developments amortised over a period of up to ten years.\n\nIn certain instances, the Group enters into cloud computing arrangements with third-party providers, such as software as a service (SaaS), where the Group is provided the right to access and use the application software over the contract term. At inception of the contract, the Group will assess whether such an arrangement gives rise to the recognition of a software intangible asset.\n\nWhere the Group determines that no software intangible asset should be recognised, the cloud computing arrangement is determined to be a service contract and the associated fees paid are expensed as incurred. In addition, the costs incurred for both the customisation and configuration of the application software are generally expensed as incurred.\n\n## g Emissions allowances\n\nWhere an operating company purchases emissions allowances these amounts are recognised at cost and recorded within Intangible assets. As an operating company emits CO2 equivalent and builds up an obligation to the relevant authorities, a provision is recognised.\n\nEmissions allowances recorded within Intangible assets are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has purchased emission allowances to offset the emissions, the provision is recognised at the weighted average cost of the intangible asset. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has not yet purchased emission allowances to offset the emissions, the provision is recognised at the market price of the allowances required at the reporting date. As the provision is recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges.\n\nThe Group's emissions obligation, recognised as a separate liability, is extinguished when the associated emission certificates are surrendered, which is typically within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\nFrom time to time the Group enters into sale and repurchase transactions for specified emission allowances. Such transactions do not meet the recognition criteria of a sale under IFRS 15 and accordingly the asset is retained on the Balance sheet within Intangible assets and an Other financing liability recognised equal to the proceeds received.",

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the value by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use.

Indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence. Where the Group cannot exercise control over an entity in which it has a shareholding greater than 51 per cent, the equity interest is treated as an associate undertaking.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, and initially recognised at cost. The Group's interest in the net assets of associates and joint ventures is included in Investments accounted for using the equity method in the Balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the Income statement, below operating result. The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## a Financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified, upon initial recognition, as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), or fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.\n\nThe classification of financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition depends on the financial assets' and financial liabilities' contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset or financial liability to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. A financial asset or financial liability that is not SPPI is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. This assessment is performed on an instrument by instrument basis.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets and financial liabilities establishes how it manages its financial assets and financial liabilities in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.\n\n## Long-term borrowings\n\nLong-term borrowings are recorded at amortised cost, including lease liabilities which contain interest rate swaps that are closely related to the underlying financing and as such are not accounted for as an embedded derivative.\n\n## Convertible debt\n\nConvertible bonds are classified as either compound financial instruments or hybrid financial instruments depending on the settlement alternatives upon redemption. Where the bondholders exercise their equity conversion options and the Group has no alternative other than to settle the convertible bonds into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the Company, then the bonds are classified as a compound financial instrument. Where the Group has an alternative settlement mechanism to the convertible bonds that permits settlement in cash, then the convertible instrument is classified as a hybrid financial instrument.\n\nConvertible bonds that are classified as compound financial instruments consist of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt, and is subsequently recorded on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds, and is recognised within Borrowings. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in the equity portion of the convertible bond in Other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this value and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.",

        "page_content": "Convertible bonds that are classified as hybrid financial instruments consist only of a liability component recognised within Borrowings. At the date of issue, the entirety of the convertible bonds is accounted for at fair value with subsequent fair value gains or losses recorded within Borrowings. The fair value of such financial instruments is obtained from their respective quoted prices in active markets, with the portion of the change in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of the convertible bonds recognised in Other comprehensive income and the portion of the change in fair value attributable to market conditions recognised in the Income statement within Finance costs.\n\nIssue costs associated with compound financial instruments are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying values at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. Issue costs associated with hybrid financial instruments are expensed immediately to the Income statement.\n\n## Other equity investments\n\nOther equity investments are non-derivative financial assets including listed and unlisted investments, excluding interests in associates and joint ventures. On initial recognition, these equity investments are irrevocably designated as measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income. They are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Other comprehensive income with no recycling of these gains and losses to the Income statement when the investment is sold or a change in the structure of transaction changes its classification as an Other equity instrument. Dividends received on other equity investments are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.\n\n## Financial instruments held for trading\n\nFinancial instruments are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of selling the associated asset in the near term and not having been purchased for operational purposes.\n\nBy entering into short-term forward sales contracts, the Group seeks to optimise capital allocation while minimising the associated economic risk.\n\n## Interest-bearing deposits\n\nInterest-bearing deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions with contractual cash flows that are SPPI, and held in order to collect contractual cash flows, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost, based on either 12-month or lifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The simplified approach, based on the calculation and recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, is applied to contracts that have a maturity of one year or less, including trade receivables.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and when estimating the expected credit loss, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment, including forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information takes into consideration the forecast economic conditions expected to impact the outstanding balances at the balance sheet date. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as the customer having filed for liquidation.\n\n## b Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand or maturing within three months of the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## c Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swap derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and fuel derivatives (including options, swaps and forward contracts) are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. They are classified as financial instruments through the Income statement. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising from remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged (as detailed below under cash flow hedges). The time value of options is excluded from the designated hedging instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. Movements in the time value of options are recognised in Other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nWhen forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the spot component of the forward contract as the hedging instrument within a hedge relationship. The effective portion of gains or losses arising on the change in fair value of the spot component are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The forward component of a forward contract is not designated within a hedge relationship, with the associated gains and losses on the forward component recorded within Other comprehensive income in the Cost of hedging reserve within equity until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nTo manage foreign exchange movements on foreign currency customer cash inflows (denominated in US dollars, euros and Japanese yen), certain non-derivative repayment instalments on foreign currency-denominated interest-bearing liabilities are designated as hedging instruments within a hedge relationship. The effective portion of gains or losses arising from movements in foreign exchange rates are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Accumulated gains or losses within the cash flow hedge reserve are transferred to Sales in advance of carriage in the same period as the forecast transaction occurs or when hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, at which point amounts are immediately reclassified to the Income statement.",

Where there is a change in the risk management objective, then hedge accounting is discontinued and the associated cumulative gain or loss arising prior to the change in risk management objective remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the underlying hedged item impacts the Income statement had the risk management objective continued to have been met. Where a forecast transaction which was previously determined to be highly probable and for which hedge accounting applied, is no longer expected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to the Income statement.\n\nEach operating company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, that are not designated in a hedge relationship, in order to mitigate foreign exchange movements on financial liabilities designated in currencies other than the presentational currency of each operating company, including but not limited to, lease liabilities. Movements in the fair value of such derivatives are recognised in the Income statement in the period in which they occur and are presented within Net currency retranslation charges.\n\nExchange gains and losses on monetary investments are taken to the Income statement unless the item has been designated and is assessed as an effective hedging instrument. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary investments are reflected in equity.\n\n## d Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as in a cash flow hedge relationship of a highly probable expected future transaction are assessed for effectiveness and accordingly recorded in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\n## Hedge effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: (i) there is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and (iii) the hedge ratio is aligned with the requirements of the Group's risk management strategy and in all instances is maintained at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship is expected to be on inception and at each reporting date effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative model.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 in hedges of fuel purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;\n- \u00b7 in hedges of foreign currency purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;\n- \u00b7 in hedges of interest rate payments, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences in the critical terms between the interest rate derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty; and\n- \u00b7 in all hedges, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences between the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hypothetical derivative, such as where on inception of the hedge relationship the fair value of the hedging instrument is not zero.\n\nIneffectiveness is recorded within the Income statement as Realised/unrealised (losses)/gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and presented within Other non-operating credits.\n\n## Reclassification and transfer adjustments\n\nGains and losses accumulated in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity are either reclassified from the Cash flow hedge reserve when the hedged item affects the Income statement, or transferred from the Cash flow hedge reserve when the hedged item gives rise to recognition in the Balance sheet as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of expenses within the Income statement (such as the purchase of jet fuel for which both fuel and the associated foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded in both the Cash flow hedge reserve and the Cost of hedging reserve are reclassified and included in the Income statement within the same caption as the hedged item is presented. Such reclassification occurs in the same period as the hedged item is recognised in the Income statement;\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as the purchase of aircraft for which foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument or where the purchase of jet fuel gives rise to the recognition of fuel inventory in storage facilities), or a non-financial liability (such as the sales in advance of carriage for which both foreign currency derivatives and non-financial derivative instruments are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within both the Cash flow hedge reserve and the Cost of hedging reserve are transferred and included in the initial cost of the asset and liability, respectively. These gains or losses are recorded in the Income statement as the nonfinancial asset and the non-financial liability affects the Income statement (which for aircraft is through Depreciation, amortisation and impairment over the expected life of the aircraft, for fuel inventory through Fuel, oil costs and emission charges when it is consumed and for sales in advance of carriage through Passenger revenue when the flight is flown); and\n- \u00b7 where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability (such as variable rate debt for which interest rate swaps are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within the Cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to the Income statement to Interest expense within Finance costs at the same time as the interest income or expense arises on the hedged item.\n\nFurther information on the risk management activities of the Group is given in note 29.",

The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform does not cause hedge accounting to terminate prior to contracts being amended. Where transition to an alternative benchmark rate has taken place, the Group ceases to apply the Phase 1 amendments and instead applies the Phase 2 amendments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDuring the course of 2023, the Group ceased to apply the Phase 1 amendments, as the last of the associated IBORs transitioned to alternative benchmarks. Prior to these transitions and where the Group applied the Phase 1 amendments, the following reliefs were applied:\n\n- \u00b7 when considering the highly probable requirement, the Group assumed that those benchmark rates that needed to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the Group's hedged long-term borrowings were based, did not change as a result of IBOR reform;\n- \u00b7 in assessing whether the hedge was expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group assumed that those benchmark rates that needed to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged longterm borrowings and the interest rate swaps that hedge them were based, were not altered by IBOR reform; and\n- \u00b7 the Group has not reclassified the Cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect.\n\nWhen the Group ceased to apply the Phase 1 amendments, the Group amended its hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform, but only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows being hedged; or\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe associated hedge documentation was updated to reflect these changes in designation by the end of the reporting period in which the changes were made. Such amendments did not give rise to the hedge relationship being discontinued.\n\nWhen the Group transitioned to alternative benchmark rates, the accumulated amounts within the cash flow hedge reserve were determined to be based on the alternative benchmark rates and no reclassification adjustments were made from the cash flow hedge reserve to the Income statement.\n\n## Long-term borrowings and lease liabilities\n\nPhase 2 of the amendments required that, for financial instruments measured using amortised cost measurement, changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform are reflected by adjusting their effective interest rate prospectively. No gain or loss was recognised upon transition to the new benchmark. The expedient was only applicable to direct changes that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFor lease liabilities where there was a change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows, as a practical expedient the lease liability was remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a discount rate that reflected the change in the interest rate where the change was required by IBOR reform.\n\nNo amounts have been recorded in the current or prior periods as a result of these amendments.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\n## a Pension obligations\n\nThe Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior years.\n\nTypically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the net obligation calculation results in an asset for the Group, the recognition of an asset is limited to any future refunds, net of the relevant taxes, from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). The fair value of the plan assets is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The fair value of insurance policies which exactly match the amount and timing of some or all benefits payable under the scheme are deemed to be the present value of the related obligations. Longevity swaps are measured at their fair value.\n\nCurrent service costs are recognised within employee costs in the year in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised in the event of a plan amendment or curtailment, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or severance obligations. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are recognised in the Income statement. Remeasurements, comprising IAS 19 gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Income statement in subsequent periods.\n\n## b Severance obligations\n\nSeverance obligations are recognised when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises a provision for severance payments when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal, or providing severance payments as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nOther employee benefits are recognised when there is deemed to be a present obligation.\n\n## c Flight crew provisions\n\nThe Group's obligations in respect of flight crew provisions are calculated separately for each collective bargaining agreement. In estimating these obligations, the Group makes assumptions regarding the number of employees that will elect to take early retirement under these agreements, and the age at which they make this election (where relevant), using the probability weighted methodology. The Group recognises a provision for service costs from the date of employment of the relevant individual, with the corresponding amount recorded within the Income statement. The provisions recognised are discounted, at the reporting date and the effect of unwinding of these discount rates are recognised as a finance cost in the Income statement.\n\nRemeasurements of the provisions are made for changes in financial assumptions and recorded in Other comprehensive income. The Group records changes through Other comprehensive income, where assumptions regarding the elections to be made by individuals differs to actual elections. These calculations are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\n## Taxation\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nIncome tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Such cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. Inventories include mainly aircraft spare parts, repairable aircraft engine parts and fuel held in storage facilities.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment plans, under which the Group awards equity instruments of the Group for services rendered by employees. The fair value of the share-based payment plans is measured at the date of grant using a valuation model provided by external specialists. The resulting cost, as adjusted for the expected and actual level of vesting of the plan, is charged to the Income statement over the period in which the options vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, and accordingly the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income statement with a corresponding entry in equity.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhen the share capital of the Company is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable transaction costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity within the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting gain or loss on the transaction is presented as an adjustment to Retained earnings with no gain or loss recorded in the Income statement.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) an obligation exists for a present liability in respect of a past event; (ii) where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated; and (iii) where it is considered probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. Where it is not considered probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources required to settle the obligation, the Group does not recognise a provision, but discloses the matter as a contingent liability. The Group assesses whether each matter is probable of there being an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation at each reporting date.\n\nEmployee leaving indemnities and other employee provisions are recorded for flight crew who, meeting certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve or of taking early retirement. The Group is obligated to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The calculation is performed by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nOther employee related provisions are recognised for direct expenditures of business reorganisation such as severance payments (restructuring provisions) where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe method for determining legal claims provisions is determined on a claim by claim basis. Where a claim includes a significant population of items, the weighted average provision is estimated by determining all potential outcomes and the probability of their occurrence. Where a claim relates to a single item, then the Group determines the associated provision by applying the most likely outcome giving consideration to alternative outcomes. Where an individual claim is significant, the disclosure of quantitative information is restricted to the extent that it does not prejudice the outcome of the claim. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the provision. Where discounting is used, the effect of unwinding the discount rate is recognised as a Finance cost in the Income statement.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily derives from transportation services for both passengers and cargo. Revenue is recognised when the transportation service has been provided.\n\nPassenger tickets are generally paid for in advance of transportation and are recognised, net of discounts, as Deferred revenue and presented within current liabilities until either: (i) the customer has flown; or (ii) where the customer does not fly on the intended date and has purchased a non-flexible fare.\n\nFor flexible and semi-flexible tickets, when the customer does not travel on the intended date, a term referred to as 'unused tickets', the customer has a number of options they can elect to apply, depending on the fare type: (i) reschedule the date of intended travel; (ii) request a refund; or (iii) request a voucher.\n\nThe Group estimates the amount of these unused tickets for which customers are not expected to exercise their remaining rights prior to expiry based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience, a term referred to as 'unused ticket breakage'. This revenue is recognised based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. For unused ticket breakage, revenue is recognised only when the risk of a significant reversal of revenue is remote. The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date.\n\nWhere a flight is cancelled, the customer has a number of options they can elect to apply to their unused tickets: (i) compensation; (ii) a refund; (iii) changing to an alternative flight; or (iv) the receipt of a voucher.",

The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is constrained, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nPayments received in relation to certain ancillary services regarding passenger transportation, such as change fees, are not considered to be distinct from the performance obligation to provide the passenger flight. Payments relating to these ancillary services are recognised in Deferred revenue in current liabilities until the customer has flown.\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to passenger transportation services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. The Group acts as an agent where: (i) it collects various taxes, duties and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to passengers and remits these to the relevant taxing authorities; and (ii) where it provides interline services to airline partners outside of the Group. Commissions earned in relation to agency services are recognised as revenue when the underlying goods or services have been transferred to the customer. In all other instances, the Group considers it acts as the principal in relation to passenger transportation services.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\nThe Group has identified a single performance obligation in relation to cargo services and the associated revenue is measured at its standalone selling price and recognised on satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs on the fulfilment of the transportation service.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe Group has identified several performance obligations in relation to services that give rise to revenue being recognised within Other revenue. These services, their performance obligations and associated revenue recognition include:\n\n- \u00b7 the provision of maintenance services and overhaul services for engines and airframes, where the Group is engaged to enhance an asset while the customer retains control of the asset. Accordingly, the performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue recognised, over time. The Group estimates the proportion of the contract completed at the reporting date and recognises revenue based on the percentage of completion of the contract;\n- \u00b7 the provision of ground handling services, where the performance obligations are fulfilled when the services are provided;\n- \u00b7 the provision of holiday and hotel services, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer receives the benefit of the service; and\n- \u00b7 brand and marketing activities, where the performance obligations are satisfied as the associated activities occur.\n\n## Customer loyalty programmes\n\nThe Group operates four principal loyalty programmes: the British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Vueling Club and the Aer Lingus Aer Club. The customer loyalty programmes award travellers Avios to redeem for various rewards, primarily redemption travel, including flights, hotels and car hire. Avios are also sold to commercial partners to use in loyalty activity.\n\n## Avios issuance\n\nWhen issued, the standalone selling price of an Avios is recorded within Deferred revenue in current liabilities until the customer redeems the Avios. The standalone selling price of Avios is based on the value of the awards for which the points could be redeemed. The Group also recognises revenue associated with the proportion of Avios which are not expected to be redeemed, referred to as 'breakage', based on the results of modelling using historical experiences and expected future trends in customer behaviour, up until the reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is limited, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nWhere the issuance of Avios arises from travel on the Group's airlines, the consideration received from the customer may differ to the aggregation of the relative standalone selling prices. In such instances the allocation of the consideration to each performance obligation is undertaken on a proportional basis using the relative standalone selling prices.\n\nThe Group has contractual arrangements with non-Group airlines and non-air partners for the issuance and redemption of Avios, for which it has identified the following performance obligations:\n\n## Companion vouchers\n\nCertain non-air partners issue their card holders with companion vouchers, which forms part of the variable consideration of the overall contract, depending on the level of expenditure by the card holders, for redemption on the airlines of the Group for the same flight and class of cabin as the underlying fare being purchased. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the companion voucher performance obligation, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction.",

        "page_content": "## Brand and marketing activities\n\nFor both air and non-air partners, the Group licenses the Avios and the airline brands for certain activities, such as the creation of cobranded credit cards. In addition, the Group has certain contractual arrangements whereby it commits to provide marketing services to the members of the loyalty schemes on behalf of those partners. For the provision of both brand and marketing services, the partner receives benefits incremental to the issuance of Avios. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the brand and marketing performance obligations, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction for access to comparable brands for the period over which they use the brand. For brand services, as the Group considers that the partner has the right to use the brand, revenue is recognised as the brand service is provided and not over time. For marketing performance obligations, revenue is recognised as the marketing activities occur based on when the partner receives the benefit of those services.\n\n## Upfront payments\n\nWhere a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group which does not relate to any specific performance obligation, then the Group considers such payments as advance payments for future goods and services and the associated revenue is recognised as those goods and services are provided, as detailed above. In such instances the payment is allocated across all of the performance obligations over the contract term. The Group estimates the expected level of Avios to be issued over the contract term using experience, historical and expected future trends, and allocates the payments to the relevant performance obligations accordingly. At each reporting date, the Group updates its estimate of the number of Avios expected to be issued over the total contract term and recognises a cumulative catch-up adjustment where necessary.\n\nWhen a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group, the Group assesses whether such a payment is representative of a significant financing event. Where a significant financing component is identified, the Group estimates a market rate of interest that an arm's length financial liability of similar size and tenor would yield. The Group recognises the imputed interest within the Income statement as Other finance costs within Finance costs.\n\n## Other considerations\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to the loyalty services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. In particular, the Group acts as an agent where customers redeem their Avios on interline partner flights outside of the Group, where the fees payable to the interline partner are presented net against the associated release of the Deferred revenue.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or nature and where such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. While management has defined a list of items and a quantitative threshold that would merit categorisation as exceptional that has been established through historical experience, the Group retains the flexibility to add additional items should their size or nature merit such presentation. The accounting policy in respect of exceptional items and classification of an item as exceptional is approved by the Board, through the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group is monitored by the Management Committee and the Board on a pre-exceptional basis to enable comparison to prior reporting periods as well as to other selected companies, and also for making strategic, financial and operational decisions.\n\nThe exceptional items recorded in the Income statement include, but are not limited to, items such as significant settlement agreements with the Group's pension schemes; significant restructuring; the impact of business combination transactions that do not contribute to the ongoing results of the Group; significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; legal settlements; individually significant tax transactions; and the impact of the sale, disposal or impairment of an asset or investment in a business. Where exceptional items are separately disclosed, the resultant tax impact is additionally separately disclosed. Certain exceptional items may cover more than a single reporting period, such as significant restructuring events, but not more than two reporting periods.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent market rates of interest are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received and recognised within Borrowings. Those loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent below market rates of interest are measured at inception at their fair value and recognised within Borrowings, with the differential to the proceeds received recorded within Deferred income and released to the relevant financial statement caption in the Income statement on a systematic basis. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Income statement in the relevant financial statement caption on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results in the future may differ from judgements and estimates upon which financial information has been prepared. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n## a Employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities, other employee related restructuring\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group recognised \u20ac1,380 million in respect of employee benefit assets (2022: \u20ac2,334 million) and \u20ac175 million in respect of employee benefit obligations (2022: \u20ac217 million). Further information on employee benefit obligations is disclosed in note 34.\n\nThe cost of employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities and other employee-related provisions is determined using the valuation requirements of IAS 19. These valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such assumptions are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions relating to these schemes are disclosed in note 34. The Group determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with qualified actuaries. Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome will impact future net assets and total comprehensive income. The sensitivity to changes in pension assumptions is disclosed in note 34.\n\nUnder the Group's Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) defined benefit schemes, increases to pensions are based on the annual Government Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Additionally, in APS there is provision for the Trustee to pay increases up to the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject to certain affordability tests. Historically market expectations for RPI could be derived by comparing the prices of UK Government fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, with CPI assessed by considering the Bank of England's inflation target and comparison of the construction of the two inflation indices.\n\nIn November 2020, the UK Government and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) confirmed alignment of RPI with CPIH (a variant of CPI) from February 2030. In assessing RPI and CPI inflation from investment market data, allowance has been made for alignment of RPI with CPIH from 2030 and, therefore, effectively no gap between RPI and CPI inflation from that date. CPI inflation before 2030 is assumed to be 1 per cent per annum below RPI inflation.\n\n## b Revenue recognition\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group recognised \u20ac8,023 million (2022: \u20ac7,644 million) in respect of deferred revenue of which \u20ac2,712 million (2022: \u20ac2,630 million) related to customer loyalty programmes. Further information on deferred revenue is included in note 24.\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nPassenger revenue is recognised when the transportation service is provided. At the time of intended transportation, revenue is also recognised in respect of estimated unused tickets breakage and is estimated based on the terms and conditions of the tickets and historical experience. The Group considers that there is no reasonably possible change to unused ticket assumptions that would have a material impact on passenger revenue recorded in the year. A 2 percentage point increase in the level of unused ticket breakage of the sales in advance of carriage balance (excluding vouchers) at 31 December 2023 would result in an adjustment to Deferred revenue of \u20ac93 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.\n\nFor details regarding the voucher liability at 31 December 2023 and the associated sensitivity, see note 24.\n\n## Customer loyalty schemes\n\nRevenue associated with the issuance of Avios under customer loyalty programmes is based on the relative standalone selling prices of the related performance obligations (brand, marketing and Avios), determined using estimation techniques. The transaction price of brand and marketing services is determined using specific brand valuation methodologies. The transaction price of an Avios is determined as the price of the rewards against which they can be redeemed and is reduced to take account of the proportion of Avios that are not expected to be redeemed by customers.\n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, due to the significant restrictions imposed on the ability of customers to redeem Avios, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the disruption in the patterns of redemption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group considered that the trends experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were not reflective of the long-term expected patterns of redemption and accordingly, the Group was unable to determine with a high degree of probability that there would not be a significant reversal of revenue in the future had it applied the redemption trends that were experienced over the period of the pandemic. Accordingly, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group estimated the level of redemption activity based on pre-COVID-19 pandemic customer behaviour.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group considers historical redemption activity, including customers' more recent behaviours following the COVID-19 pandemic, representative of long-term behavioural trends, such that the Group considers that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue to be sufficiently low. Accordingly, the Group has updated its estimated level of redemption activity to incorporate current customer behaviour.\n\nThe Group estimates the number of Avios not expected to be redeemed using statistical modelling based on historical experience and expected future trends in customer behaviour. A 5 percentage point increase in the assumption of Avios not expected to be redeemed would result in an adjustment to Deferred revenue of \u20ac94 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.",

        "page_content": "## Unredeemed vouchers liability\n\nHistorically, where a voucher has been issued to a customer in the event of a flight cancellation, the Group estimated, based on historical experience, the level of such vouchers not expected to be used prior to expiry and recognised revenue accordingly. During 2020 and 2021, due to the significant level of flight cancellations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group issued a greater volume of vouchers than it would have otherwise done. In addition, given the uncertainty as to the timing of customers redeeming these vouchers, the Group was unable to estimate with a high degree of probability that there would not be a significant reversal of revenue in the future had it applied the historical expiry trends over the period of the pandemic. Accordingly, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group did not recognise revenue arising from those vouchers issued due to COVID-19 pandemic-related cancellations until either the voucher was redeemed or it expired.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group considers historical redemption activity, including customers' more recent behaviours following the COVID-19 pandemic, representative of the redemption trends expected through to expiry of the vouchers, such that the Group considers that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue to be sufficiently low. Accordingly, the Group has updated its estimated level of redemption activity to incorporate current customer behaviour.\n\n## c Income taxes\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group recognised \u20ac1,202 million in respect of deferred tax assets (2022: \u20ac1,282 million). Further information on current and deferred tax is disclosed in note 10.\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. Where the Group determines that it is more likely than not that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the financial statements on that basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability based on either: the Group's judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability-weighted average approach.\n\nThe Group recognises deferred tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Management uses judgement, including the consideration of past and current operating performance and the future projections of performance laid out in the approved business plan in order to assess the probability of recoverability.\n\nIn exercising this judgement, while there are no time restrictions on the utilisation of historic tax losses in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates, future cash flow projections are forecast for a period of up to ten years from the balance sheet date, which represents the period over which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u20ac1,584 million relating to tax losses and other temporary differences the Group does not reasonably expect to utilise. In applying the aforementioned judgement, had the Group extended the period of future cash flow projections indefinitely, then the amount of unrecognised tax losses would have reduced by \u20ac575 million. Conversely, if the forecast profit before tax for each operating company was reduced by 2 percentage points over the forecast period, the amount of the unrecognised tax losses would increase by \u20ac12 million.\n\n## d Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group recognised \u20ac2,428 million (2022: \u20ac2,423 million) in respect of intangible assets with an indefinite life, including goodwill. Further information on these assets is included in note 17.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite economic lives are tested, as part of the cash-generating units to which they relate, for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which use a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model, which are then compared to the carrying amount of the associated cash-generating unit.\n\nIn determining the carrying value of each cash generating unit (CGU), the Group allocates all associated operating tangible and intangible assets, including ROU assets. In addition, the Group has allocated certain liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU where those liabilities are critical to the underlying operations of the cash-generating unit and in the event of a disposal of the cashgenerating unit would be required to be transferred to the purchaser. Such liabilities include lease liabilities.\n\nThe Group has applied judgement in the weighting of each scenario in the discounted cash flow model and these calculations require the use of estimates in the determination of key assumptions and sensitivities as disclosed in notes 4 and 17.\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. When such indicators are identified, then non-financial assets are tested for impairment.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## e Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group recognised \u20ac2,529 million in respect of maintenance, restoration and handback provisions, principally in respect of leased aircraft (2022: \u20ac2,400 million). Information on movements on the provision is disclosed in note 27.\n\nIFRS 16 does not address the accounting for maintenance, restoration and handback provisions that arise through the usage of the underlying asset and accordingly, the Group has applied judgement in applying an accounting policy with regard to the recognition and subsequent measurement of such provisions for leased aircraft. The Group's accounting policy for provisions that arise through usage or through the passage of time, is to recognise the associated estimated costs in the Income statement as the underlying asset is used or through the passage of time. The approach applied by the Group is consistent with the majority of major airlines that prepare their financial statements under IFRS. Were the Group to apply an alternative accounting policy, the financial impact would be materially different at the reporting date. An alternative accounting policy that the Group could have applied was the components approach, where the Group would capitalise the estimated costs of major maintenance events and depreciating them until the subsequent maintenance event (or to the end of lease term) and providing over the lease term for any expected cash compensation for maintenance obligations at the end of the lease. The Group considers that the current accounting policy for maintenance, restoration and handback activities reflects the obligations under its lease arrangements.\n\nThe Group has a number of contracts with service providers to replace or repair engine parts and for other maintenance checks. These agreements are complex and generally cover a number of years. Provisions for maintenance, restoration and handback are made based on the best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. In determining this best estimate, the Group applies significant judgement as to the level of forecast costs expected to be incurred when the major maintenance event occurs. Other assumptions not considered to be significant include aircraft utilisation, expected maintenance intervals and the aircraft's condition. The associated forecast costs are discounted to their present value. While the Group considers that there are no reasonably possible change to any of the individual assumptions that would have a material impact on the provisions, a combination of changes in several assumptions may. The Group considers that a reasonably possible change in the inflation rate and discount rate assumptions of a 100 basis points increase would give rise to an increase of \u20ac53 million (2022: \u20ac51 million) and a decrease of \u20ac59 million (2022: \u20ac68 million), respectively, when applied in isolation to one another.\n\n## Judgements\n\n## a Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. Such judgement includes consideration of fleet plans which underpin approved business plans and historical experience regarding the extension of leases. After the commencement date, the Group re-assesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that affects the Group's ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. Further information is given in note 14.\n\n## b Determining whether the Group has significant influence over Air Europa Holdings\n\nThe Group applies judgement in the determination as to whether it has the power with which to participate in the decision-making of, and as a result significant influence over, Air Europa Holdings, S.L. (Air Europa Holdings). Such judgement includes the consideration as to the ability of the Group to: have representation on the board of Air Europa Holdings; participate in the policymaking processes, including participation in decisions regarding dividends and other distributions; the existence of material transactions between Air Europa Holdings and the Group; and enable the interchange of management personnel and provide essential technical information.\n\nIn forming its judgement, the Group notes that: it does not have the ability to have representation on the board of Air Europa Holdings; it does not have the ability to participate in the policy-making processes; has not entered into material transactions outside of the normal course of business, with those transactions arising in the normal course of business being immaterial in nature; it does not have the ability to enable the interchange of management personnel; and it does not have the ability to provide essential technical information. The Group has therefore concluded that it does not have significant influence over Air Europa Holdings.\n\nAccordingly, the Group accounts for its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings as an Other equity investment and measures it at fair value through Other comprehensive income. Had the Group concluded that it does have significant influence over Air Europa Holdings, then the shareholding would have been classified as an associate, measured at cost on inception and subsequently measured using the equity method.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the fair value of its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings was \u20ac129 million. Further information is given in note 19.\n\n## c Determining whether the HMRC enquiries into the IAG Loyalty VAT accounting gives rise to a provision or a contingent liability\n\nThe Group applies judgement in the determination as to whether it considers the outcome of the enquiries between IAG Loyalty and His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), in the UK, on the IAG Loyalty VAT accounting, is more probable than not to result in an adverse outcome to the Group, and accordingly whether to record the matter as a provision or as a contingent liability.\n\nIn forming its judgement, the Group, with its legal and tax advisors, have reviewed the emerging view issued by HMRC, as well has having considered the historic tax ruling issued by HMRC to the Group on this matter. As a result, the Group does not consider it probable that an adverse outcome will eventuate and accordingly no provision has been recorded at 31 December 2023 and the matter has been disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\nHad the Group, with its legal and tax advisors, considered that it was more probable than not that an adverse outcome would eventuate, then the Group would have recognised a provision for the best estimate of the potential outflow of economic benefit to the Group, with a corresponding charge recorded within the Income statement. Further information is given in note 10g.",

The Group has assessed the impact of these standards, amendments and interpretations and it is not expected that these will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the Group unless otherwise stated. The Group plans to adopt the following standards, interpretations and amendments on the date they become mandatory:\n\n- \u00b7 disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements - amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024;\n- \u00b7 lease liability in a sale and leaseback - amendments to IFRS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024; and\n- \u00b7 on 31 October 2022, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 1 - classification of liabilities as current or non-current (the 'Amendments'), effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The Amendments will require the \u20ac825 million convertible bond that matures in 2028, which as at 31 December 2023, had a carrying value of \u20ac735 million, to be reclassified from a non-current liability to a current liability with the comparative presentation as at 31 December 2022 also reclassified. The Amendments require that where the conversion feature of a convertible instrument does not meet the recognition criteria for separate presentation within equity and where the associated bond holders have the irrevocable right to exercise the conversion feature within 12 months of the balance sheet date, that such convertible instruments be presented as current. Other than this reclassification, the Amendments will not have a material effect on the reported results or net assets of the Group.\n\n## 3 Significant changes and transactions in the current reporting period\n\nThe financial performance and position of the Group was affected by the following significant events and transactions in the year to 31 December 2023 as detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 on 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings that it had not previously owned. On successful completion of the transaction, 54,064,575 ordinary shares of the Company (which represented \u20ac100 million at the date of the agreement) will be transferred to and \u20ac100 million in cash will be paid to Globalia, with a further \u20ac100 million paid on both the first and second anniversary of completion.\n\nIn addition, the Group has agreed to pay a break-fee to Globalia of \u20ac50 million should: (i) the relevant approvals, detailed below, not be forthcoming within 24 months of entering into the agreement; or (ii) the Group terminates the agreement at any time prior to completion. Under the agreement, this 24-month period can be extended, by mutual consent. The acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition authorities. Until the completion of these approvals, the acquisition does not meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and no accounting has been made for the transaction in these consolidated financial statements;\n\n- \u00b7 on 4 March 2023, Aer Lingus repaid in full the \u20ac50 million of the financial arrangement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). At 31 December 2023, \u20ac350 million of undrawn facilities remain available for draw down;\n- \u00b7 in May 2023, the Group announced its intention to carry out a share purchase programme in order to acquire approximately 50 per cent of the aforementioned ordinary shares required as part of the acquisition of Air Europa Holdings. The programme completed during the year to 31 December 2023, with the Group having purchased 27 million treasury shares amounting to \u20ac49 million;\n- \u00b7 on 30 June 2023, the Group converted 10 Airbus A320neo options into firm orders.

        "page_content": "## 4 Impact of climate change on financial reporting\n\n## Significant transactions and critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the determination of the impact of climate change\n\nAs a result of climate change the Group has designed and approved its Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, which commits the Group to net zero emissions by 2050. While approved business plans currently have a duration of three years, the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy impacts both the short-, medium- and long-term operations of the Group.\n\nThe details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy include, but are not limited to, the following that are within the control of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 the additional cost of the Group's commitment to increasing the level of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to 10 per cent by 2030 and to 70 per cent by 2050;\n- \u00b7 the cost of incurring an increase in the level of carbon offsetting and carbon capture schemes; and\n- \u00b7 the impact of introducing more fuel-efficient aircraft and being able to operate these more efficiently.\n\nIn addition to these inputs and measures within the control of management, Flightpath Net Zero includes assumptions pertaining to consumers, governments and regulators regarding the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the impact on passenger demand for air travel as a result of both passenger trends regarding climate change and government policies;\n- \u00b7 investment and policy regarding the development of SAF production facilities;\n- \u00b7 investment and improvements in air traffic management; and\n- \u00b7 the price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) and the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\n\nThe level of uncertainty regarding the impact of these factors increases over time. Accordingly, the Group has applied critical estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of climate change regarding the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities within the financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - cash flow forecast estimation\n\nWith the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy assessing the impact over a long-term horizon to 2050, the level of estimation uncertainty in the determination of cash flow forecasts increases over time. For those assets and liabilities, where their recoverability is dependent on long-term cash flows, the following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements, to the extent they can be reliably measured, have been applied:\n\n## a Long-term fleet plans and useful economic lives\n\nThe Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy has been developed in conjunction with the long-term fleet plans of each operating company. This includes the annual assessment of useful lives and the residual values of each aircraft type.\n\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group retired 72 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories. These retired aircraft were older generation aircraft, that were less fuel-efficient, more carbon-intensive and more expensive to operate than more modern models.\n\nSubsequent to the retirement of these aircraft, coupled with the future committed delivery of 178 fuel-efficient aircraft as detailed in note 15, the Group considers the existing fleet assets align with the long-term fleet plans to achieve its Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy. All aircraft in the fleet, and those due to be delivered in the future, have the capability to utilise SAF in their operations without impediment. Accordingly, no impairment has arisen in the current or prior year, nor have the useful lives and residual values of aircraft been amended, as a result of the Group's decarbonisation plans.\n\n## b Impairment testing of the Group's cash generating units\n\nThe Group applies discounted cash flow models, for each cash generating unit, derived from the cash flow forecasts from the approved three-year business plans. The Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy is long term in nature and includes commitments that will occur at differing points over this time horizon. To the extent that certain of those commitments occur over the short term, then they have been incorporated into the three-year business plans.\n\nThe Group adjusts the final year (being the third year) of these probability-weighted cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change from the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy that are expected to occur over the medium term, being to 2030. These adjustments are limited to those that: (i) the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date, with those costs subsequent to 2030 having such a high degree of uncertainty that they cannot be reliably estimated; (ii) only relate to the Group's existing asset base in its current condition; and (iii) incorporate legislation and regulation that is expected to be required to achieve the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, and which is sufficiently progressed at the reporting date.\n\nAs a result, the Group's impairment modelling incorporates the following aspects of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy through to 2030, after which time the level of uncertainty regarding timing and costing becomes insufficiently reliable to estimate: (i) an increase in the level of SAF consumption to 10 per cent of the overall fuel mix; (ii) forecast cost of carbon, including SAF, ETS allowances and CORSIA allowances (all derived from externally sourced or derived information); (iii) the removal of existing free ETS allowances issued by the EU member states, Switzerland and the UK; (iv) forecast kerosene taxes applied to jet fuel for all intra EU flight activity; and (v) assumptions regarding the ability of the Group to recover these incremental costs through increased ticket pricing.",

        "page_content": "In preparing the impairment models, the Group cash flow projections are prepared on the basis of using the current fleet in its current condition. The Group excludes the estimated cash flows expected to arise from future restructuring unless already committed and assets not currently in use by the Group. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the Group's impairment modelling excludes the following aspects of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy: (i) the expected transition to electric and hydrogen aircraft, as well as future technological developments to jet engines and airframes; (ii) any savings from the transition to more fuel-efficient aircraft other than those either in the Group's fleet or those committed orders due to be delivered over the business plan period; (iii) the benefit of the development of carbon capture technologies and enhanced carbon offsetting mechanisms; (iv) the required beneficial reforms to air traffic management regulation and legislation; and (v) the required government incentives and/or support across the supply chain.\n\nAs detailed in note 17, the Group applies a long-term growth rate to these adjusted probability weighted cash flows, per CGU, and each of the long-term growth rates include a specific adjustment to reduce the rate to reflect the Group's assumptions regarding the reduced demand and elasticity impact arising from climate change. These impacts are derived with reference to external market data, industry publications and internal analysis.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, the Group has applied additional sensitivities in note 17 to reflect a more adverse impact of climate change than currently expected. This has been captured through both the downward sensitivities of the long-term growth rates, ASKs and operating margins and the increased fuel price sensitivity.\n\n## c Valuation of employee benefit scheme assets\n\nThe Group's employee benefit schemes are principally represented by the British Airways APS and NAPS schemes in the UK. The schemes are structured to make post-employment payments to members over the long term, with the Trustee having established both return-seeking assets and liability-matching assets that mature over the long term to align with the forecast benefit payments.\n\nThe assets of these schemes are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. The valuation of these assets ranges from those with quoted prices in active markets, where prices are readily and regularly available, through to those where the valuations are not based on observable market data, often requiring complex valuation models. The trustees of the schemes have integrated climate change considerations into their long-term decision-making and reporting processes across all classes of assets, actively engaging with all fund and portfolio managers to ensure that where unobservable inputs are required into valuation models, that such valuation models incorporate long-term expectations regarding the impact of climate change.\n\n## d Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts of the Group's deferred tax assets, the Group applies the future cash flow projections for a period of up to ten years derived from the approved three-year business plans. The Group applies a medium-term growth rate subsequent to the three-year business plans, specific to each operating company. In considering the impact of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, management adjusts this medium-term growth rate, where applicable, to incorporate the assumed impacts on both revenue and costs to the Group.\n\n## e The price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes\n\nThe EU, Swiss and the UK's ETS were established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost effectively. Under these schemes, companies, including the Group's companies, are required to buy emission allowances, or are issued them under existing quotas. The Group is required to surrender these allowances to the relevant authorities annually dependent on the level of CO2 equivalent emitted within a 12-month period. Over time, the level of available emission allowances decreases in order to reduce total emissions, which has the effect of increasing the price of such allowances. The Group expects that the future price of such allowances will continue to increase and that the free allocation of emission allowances will cease. Given the relative illiquid nature of the emission allowance market there is uncertainty as to the future pricing of such allowances.\n\nAs detailed in note 2, the Group accounts for the purchase of allowances as an addition to Intangible assets, which are measured at amortised cost. In addition, as the Group emits CO2 equivalent as part of its flight operations, a provision is recorded to settle the obligation. As the provision is recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges. For emissions for which the Group has already purchased allowances, the provision is valued at the weighted cost of those allowances. Where the level of emissions exceeds the amounts of allowances held, this deficit is measured at the market price of such allowances at the reporting date.\n\nFor the year to, and as at, 31 December 2023, the Group has recorded the following within the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 additions to the ETS allowance provision and accordingly an expense within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges, of \u20ac238 million (see note 27);\n- \u00b7 purchases of ETS allowances recorded as additions to intangible assets of \u20ac264 million (see note 17);\n- \u00b7 total ETS allowances at the reporting date recorded within intangible assets of \u20ac577 million (see note 17); and\n- \u00b7 commitments for forward purchase agreements for ETS allowances of \u20ac216 million (see note 15).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group has acquired and committed to acquire at fixed prices, the following percentages of its total emissions allowances forecast to be purchased over the business plan period to 31 December 2026:\n\n| Percentage of forecast emission allowances required   |       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Within 12 months                                      | 100 % |\n| 1-2 years                                             | 62 %  |\n| 2-3 years                                             | 24 %  |",

Each operating company operates its network operations as a single business unit and the IAG MC assesses performance based on measures including operating profit, and makes resource allocation decisions for the operating companies based on profitability, primarily by reference to the passenger markets in which the companies operate. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimise consolidated financial results.\n\nThe Group has determined its operating segments based on the way that it treats its businesses and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made. British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and IAG Loyalty have been identified for financial reporting purposes as reportable operating segments. LEVEL is also an operating segment but does not exceed the quantitative thresholds to be reportable and management has concluded that there are currently no other reasons why LEVEL should be separately disclosed.\n\nThere are varying levels of transactions between operating segments, which principally relate to the provision of maintenance services from the Iberia operating segment to the other operating segments, the provision of flight services by the airlines to the IAG Loyalty segment and the provision of loyalty services from IAG Loyalty to the airline operating segments.\n\nThe platform functions of the business primarily support the airline and loyalty operations. These activities are not considered to be reportable operating segments as they either earn revenues incidental to the activities of the Group and resource allocation decisions are made based on the passenger business or are not reviewed regularly by the IAG MC and are included within Other Group companies.\n\nFor the year to 31 December 2023\n\n|                                      | 2023             | 2023    | 2023    | 2023       | 2023         | 2023                     | 2023     |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|---------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| \u20ac million                            | British  Airways | Iberia  | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG  Loyalty | Other Group  companies 1 | Total    |\n| Revenue                              |                  |         |         |            |              |                          |          |\n| Passenger revenue                    | 14,204           | 5,215   | 3,180   | 2,194      | 679          | 338                      | 25,810   |\n| Cargo revenue                        | 862              | 233     | -       | 55         | -            | 6                        | 1,156    |\n| Other revenue                        | 962              | 986     | 17      | 10         | 512          | -                        | 2,487    |\n| External revenue                     | 16,028           | 6,434   | 3,197   | 2,259      | 1,191        | 344                      | 29,453   |\n| Inter-segment revenue                | 431              | 524     | 1       | 15         | 294          | 392                      | 1,657    |\n| Segment revenue                      | 16,459           | 6,958   | 3,198   | 2,274      | 1,485        | 736                      | 31,110   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation charge | (1,168)          | (409)   | (259)   | (150)      | (11)         | (66)                     | (2,063)  |\n| Operating profit/(loss)              | 1,650            | 940     | 396     | 225        | 321          | (25)                     | 3,507    |\n| Net non-operating costs              |                  |         |         |            |              |                          | (451)    |\n| Profit before tax                    |                  |         |         |            |              |                          | 3,056    |\n| Total assets                         | 22,255           | 9,454   | 3,049   | 1,999      | 3,786        | (2,863)                  | 37,680   |\n| Total liabilities                    | (19,295)         | (8,390) | (3,461) | (1,856)    | (3,115)      | 1,715                    | (34,402) |",

Further information with regard to the sensitivity of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is given in note 2.\n\n## Revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 in Spain\n\nOn 18 January 2024, the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) in Spain issued a ruling that the amendments to corporate income tax introduced by Royal Decree Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional. Further details are given in note 38.\n\n## Unrecognised temporary differences - investment in subsidiaries and associates\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of \u20ac1,910 million (2022: \u20ac823 million) of temporary differences relating to subsidiaries and associates. The Group either controls the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax consequences would arise from their reversal to a material extent.\n\n## Tax rate changes\n\nOn 3 March 2021 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On 24 May 2021 the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a charge of \u20ac13 million (2022: \u20ac17 million credit) is recorded in the Income statement and a credit of \u20ac3 million (2022: \u20ac10 million charge) is recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Engagement with tax authorities\n\nThe Group is subject to audit and enquiry by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates, and engages with those tax authorities in a cooperative manner.\n\nDuring the course of 2023, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) in India has been enquiring into the quantum and nature of any services provided by the corporate head offices of a number of international airlines, including British Airways, to their Indian branches. As at 31 December 2023 and through to the date of these financial statements, the DGGI's enquiries are ongoing.\n\n## Pillar Two minimum effective tax rate reform\n\nIn 2021 the OECD released the Two Pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This reform to the international tax system addresses the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation, and is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate.\n\nOn 15 December 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive. On 22 December 2022 the EU Minimum Tax Directive was published.\n\nOn 11 July 2023, the UK enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which introduced the Multinational Top-up Tax and the Domestic Top-up Tax with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. These taxes are the UK's adoption of the income inclusion rule and domestic minimum top-up tax rule referenced in the OECD's Pillar Two reform.\n\nOn 18 December 2023, Ireland enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which, pursuant to the EU Minimum Tax Directive, provided for the introduction of a new minimum effective rate of tax for certain businesses. These rules provide for a Qualified Domestic Top-Up Tax where an in-scope group's Irish operations have an effective rate of tax of less than 15%. They come into force for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 10 Tax continued\n\nOn 19 December 2023, Spain's Council of Ministers approved a draft law to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This is to be subject to consultation, prior to being sent to Parliament.\n\nUnder the legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the effective rate per jurisdiction and the 15 per cent minimum rate. Such legislation applies prospectively for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.\n\nFor 2023, the predominant jurisdiction in which the Group operates with an effective tax rate of less than 15 per cent is Ireland through Aer Lingus. While the impact of Pillar Two is not yet reasonably possible to estimate, for indicative purposes, in 2023 Aer Lingus recorded a current tax expense of \u20ac24 million relating to its Irish operations, representing an effective tax rate of 13 per cent. Had the effective tax rate applied by Aer Lingus to its Irish operations been 15 per cent, the current tax expense would have increased by \u20ac4 million to \u20ac28 million, which would not have had a significant impact on the overall Group effective tax rate of 13 per cent.\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 12 - international tax reform: Pillar Two model reforms, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The amendments to IAS 12 provide temporary mandatory relief from the recognition of deferred tax balances arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two legislation. Accordingly, the Group has developed an accounting policy with regard to the recognition of deferred taxes arising from the Pillar Two model rules, where no adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised that arise from the introduction of the minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate.\n\n## g Tax-related contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has certain contingent liabilities that could be reliably estimated, across all taxes, but excluding the IAG Loyalty VAT matter detailed below, at 31 December 2023 amounting to \u20ac110 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac110 million). While the Group does not consider it more likely than not that there will be material losses on these matters, given the inherent uncertainty associated with tax litigation and tax audits, there can be no guarantee that material losses will not eventuate. As the Group considers that its chances of success in each of these matters is more probable than not, it is not appropriate to make a provision for these amounts. Included in the tax-related contingent liabilities are the following:\n\n## Merger gain\n\nFollowing tax audits covering the period 2011 to 2014, the Spanish Tax Authorities issued a corporate income tax assessment to the Company regarding the merger in 2011 between British Airways and Iberia (the 'Merger'). The maximum exposure in this case is \u20ac100 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac98 million), being the amount in the tax assessment with an estimate of the interest accrued on that assessment through to 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Company appealed the assessment to the Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central or 'TEAC' (Central Administrative Tax Tribunal). On 23 October 2019, the TEAC ruled in favour of the Spanish Tax Authorities. The Company subsequently appealed this ruling to the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) on 20 December 2019, and on 24 July 2020 filed submissions in support of its case. To assist it in its deliberations as to whether a gain arose from the Merger, on 15 September 2023, the Audiencia Nacional commissioned an independent accounting expert to provide a report on the appropriate basis of accounting. As at 31 December 2023 and through to the date of these financial statements, the Audiencia Nacional has not ruled on whether a gain arose from the Merger. The Company does not expect a hearing at the Audiencia Nacional on this case until mid to late 2024 at the earliest.\n\nThe Company disputes the technical merits of the assessment and ruling of the TEAC. Based on legal advice and an external accounting expert's opinion, the Company believes that it has strong arguments to support its appeal. The Company does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts and accordingly has classified this matter as a contingent liability.\n\nShould the Company be unsuccessful in its appeal to the Audiencia Nacional , it would re-assess its position and the associated accounting treatment accordingly.\n\nWithin the context of the aforementioned tax audits, the Spanish tax authorities concluded on the value of Iberia's business within the Merger. This valuation was contested by the Company in a separate case, where no tax liability is due. The Company believes there are technical merits for a higher value, something that would indirectly reduce the quantum of the merger gain assessed in the dispute described above. On 18 January 2024, the Audiencia Nacional served notice on its judgment issued on 13 December 2023, whereby it ruled in favour of the Spanish tax authorities. The Company believes there are grounds to appeal the judgement to the Supreme Court in Spain. If an appeal on this matter was ultimately successful, it would reduce the exposure of the merger gain described above.\n\n## IAG Loyalty VAT\n\nAt 31 December 2023, and through to the date of this report, His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has issued protective notices of VAT assessments for the 24 months ended March 2020 to Avios Group (AGL) Limited, a controlled undertaking of the Group trading as IAG Loyalty. At the date of this report none of these protective notices of assessment are due for payment.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, and while its enquiries are ongoing at the date of this report, HMRC shared with the Group its emerging view on the appropriate VAT accounting, which differs to the current approach by IAG Loyalty. HMRC's emerging view asserts that the charges made by IAG Loyalty are for participating/membership in the Avios scheme and the associated charges and are subject to VAT. IAG Loyalty accounts for VAT depending on the nature of the goods or services for which Avios are redeemed, the vast majority of which are flights, and zero-rated. IAG Loyalty's VAT accounting has and continues to be based on a ruling issued by HMRC.\n\nAs at the date of this report, this emerging view did not consider the validity of the rulings HMRC has previously issued with regard to IAG Loyalty's VAT accounting. Accordingly, and while having issued the protective notices, HMRC has not confirmed whether it considers its emerging view to be retroactive or only prospective in nature. The Group expects further developments in this matter during 2024, which may include HMRC issuing an update to its emerging view.",

        "page_content": "While the Group has continued to engage with HMRC on the underlying facts, circumstances and technical analysis of the matter, as at the date of this report there remain a number of possible scenarios that could eventuate. The Group has reviewed HMRC's emerging view with its legal and tax advisors and considers it has strong arguments to support its VAT accounting, including having received a ruling previously from HMRC on the matter, and therefore does not consider it probable that an adverse outcome will eventuate. Accordingly, the Group does not consider it appropriate to record any provision for this case at 31 December 2023. The Group, in conjunction with its advisors, considers the disclosure of a potential range of exposures, associated with the aforementioned possible scenarios that could eventuate, could prejudice seriously the position of the Group in its ongoing engagement with HMRC.\n\nShould the Group and HMRC be unable to reach agreement on the appropriate VAT accounting, then the Group will have the ability to advance the case by initiating legal proceedings. To enable the Group to advance to initiate legal proceedings, it will need to pay, without admission of liability, to HMRC the total amount of assessments issued at the relevant time, which will be recoverable, in part or in full, should the Group be successful in the case. Until HMRC further progresses its enquiries, it is not possible to determine the payment required, if any, but any potential payment may result in a material cash outflow from the Group.\n\n## 11 Earnings per share\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent for basic earnings per share           | 2,655  | 431    |\n| Income statement impact of convertible bonds                                                 | 15     | (104)  |\n| Diluted earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent for diluted earnings per share | 2,670  | 327    |\n\n|                                                                                       | 2023 Number '000   | 2022 Number '000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue used for basic earnings per share | 4,932,631          | 4,958,420          |\n| Assumed conversion on convertible bonds                                               | 244,851            | 299,557            |\n| Dilutive employee share schemes outstanding                                           | 99,093             | 86,175             |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares used for diluted earnings per share        | 5,276,575          | 5,344,152          |\n\n| \u20ac cents                    |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic earnings per share   |   53.8 |    8.7 |\n| Diluted earnings per share |   50.6 |    6.1 |\n\nThe assumed conversion of the \u20ac825 million convertible bond 2028 and outstanding employee share schemes have a dilutive impact on the earnings per share for the years to 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 due to the reported profit after tax for the respective years.\n\nFor information relating to Adjusted earnings per share refer to the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## 12 Dividends\n\nThe Directors propose that no dividend be paid for the year to 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20acnil).\n\nThe future dividend capacity of the Group is dependent on the liquidity requirements and the distributable reserves of the Group's main operating companies and their capacity to pay dividends to the Company, together with the Company's distributable reserves and liquidity.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, certain debt obligations placed restrictions or conditions on the payment of dividends from the Group's main operating companies to the Company, including a loan to British Airways partially guaranteed by the UKEF and loans to Iberia and Vueling partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) in Spain.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had no restrictions on the payment of dividends from the Group's main operating companies to the Company, other than for British Airways, which has several undrawn committed credit facilities for which the commitments available are subject to certain conditions depending on the scale of any dividend from British Airways to the Company.\n\nIn addition, British Airways agreed with the Trustee of its main UK defined benefit pension scheme (NAPS) as part of the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021 that, subject to the scheme being in technical deficit, any dividends paid to IAG from 1 January 2024 through to 31 December 2024, will trigger a pension contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend. For the period of 1 January 2025 to 30 September 2025, any dividend in excess of 50 per cent of British Airways' profit after tax will trigger a pension contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend in excess of the 50 per cent of profit after tax. At 31 December 2023, NAPS was in technical surplus, and any dividend that British Airways were to pay to IAG, would not trigger a payment into NAPS unless NAPS were to move back into technical deficit. Further details on the British Airways dividend restrictions agreed with NAPS are given in note 34a.",

Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) at 31 December 2023, for which no amount has been recognised, for potential extension options of \u20ac979 million (2022: \u20ac945 million) due to it not being reasonably certain that these leases will be extended.\n\n## f Lessor accounting\n\nThe Group leases out certain of its property, plant and equipment. The Group has classified those leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as finance leases and those leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as operating leases.\n\n## Finance leases\n\nRental income from finance leases recognised by the Group in 2023 was \u20ac2 million (2022: \u20ac4 million). Rental income is recorded within Property, IT and other within the Income statement.",

The outstanding aircraft commitments including the expected delivery timeframes, totalling \u20ac11,966 million (2022: \u20ac13,484 million), are as follows:\n\n| Aircraft future deliveries at 31 December   |   2023 1 |   2022 1 |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Airbus A320 (from 2024 to 2028)             |       49 |       45 |\n| Airbus A321 (from 2024 to 2028)             |       33 |       46 |\n| Airbus A321 XLR (from 2024 to 2026)         |       14 |       14 |\n| Airbus A350-900 (from 2024 to 2025)         |        2 |        7 |\n| Airbus A350-1000 (in 2024)                  |        1 |        5 |\n| Boeing 777-9 (from 2026 to 2028)            |       18 |       18 |\n| Boeing 787-10 (from 2024 to 2026)           |       11 |        7 |\n| Boeing 737-8200 (from 2025 to 2027)         |       25 |       25 |\n| Boeing 737-10 (from 2027 to 2028)           |       25 |       25 |\n| Total 2                                     |      178 |      192 |\n\nOn 30 June 2023 the Group converted 10 Airbus A320neo options into firm orders. The aircraft will be delivered in 2028 and will be used by any of the Group's current airlines to replace A320ceo family aircraft.\n\nOn 27 July 2023, the Group converted six Boeing 787-10 options held by British Airways into firm orders and at the same time added a further six 787-10 options to its long-haul order book. The Group also converted one Airbus A350-900 option held by Iberia into a firm order. These aircraft will be delivered in 2025 and 2026 and will be used by British Airways and Iberia to restore capacity in the airlines' long-haul fleets.\n\nThe majority of these commitments are denominated in US dollars translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date and include escalation clauses dependent on the timing of aircraft deliveries. Under the terms of the committed purchase agreements, the Group is required to make periodic progress payments towards the purchase price, with the commitments above stated net of progress payments that have been made at the reporting date.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to defer aircraft deliveries and to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## 16 Non-current assets held for sale\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, there were no non-current assets held for sale.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the non-current assets held for sale of \u20ac19 million represented two Airbus A321 aircraft. No gain or loss was recognised on classification as non-current assets held for sale. These aircraft were presented within the British Airways segment and exited the business during the first half of 2023.\n\n93",

The details of these scenarios are given in the going concern section of note 2, with a weighting of 70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. Cash flow projections are based on the business plans approved by the relevant operating companies covering a three-year period. Cash flows extrapolated beyond the three-year period are projected to increase based on long-term growth rates. Cash flow projections are discounted using each CGU's pre-tax discount rate.\n\nAnnually the relevant operating companies prepare and their respective boards approve three-year business plans, and the IAG Board approves the Group three-year business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. Adjustments have been made to the final year of the business plan cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change that the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date. However, given the long-term nature of the Group's sustainability commitments, there are other aspects of these commitments that cannot be reliably estimated and accordingly have been excluded from the value-in-use calculations (see note 4). The business plan cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations also reflect all restructuring of the business where relevant that has been approved by the Board and which can be executed by management under existing labour agreements.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe value-in-use calculations for each CGU reflect the wider economic and geopolitical environments, including updated projected cash flows for activity from 2024 through to the end of 2026. For each of the Group's CGUs the key assumptions used in the valuein-use calculations are as follows:\n\n|                                | 2023             | 2023   | 2023    | 2023       | 2023        |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                       | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1             | 7-14             | 7-14   | 4-12    | 6-14       | 23          |\n| Average ASK growth per annum 1 | 3-9              | 4-10   | 1-6     | 2-16       | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate          | 1.7              | 1.5    | 0.9     | 1.3        | 1.5         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate          | 11.2             | 12.2   | 14.3    | 10.9       | 14.8        |\n\n|                                   | 2022             | 2022   | 2022    | 2022       | 2022        |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                          | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1                | 5-13             | 5-10   | 0-10    | 4-12       | 23-25       |\n| ASKs as a proportion of 2019 1, 2 | 90-105           | 92-107 | 113-123 | 102-127    | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate             | 1.7              | 1.5    | 1.4     | 1.6        | 1.7         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate             | 10.4             | 11.2   | 12.8    | 10.1       | 13.4        |",

The calculation of the long-term growth rate utilises a Base Case and a Downside Case growth rate, which is then weighted on the same basis as the cash flows detailed above of 70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. The terminal value cash flows and long-term growth rate incorporate the impacts of climate change insofar as they can be determined (see note 4). The airlines' network plans and the IAG Loyalty forecasts are reviewed annually as part of the three-year business plan preparation and reflect management's plans in response to specific market risk or opportunity.\n\nPre-tax discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and underlying risks of its primary market. The discount rate calculations are based on the circumstances of the airline industry, the loyalty scheme industry, the Group and the CGU. These rates are derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into consideration both debt and equity available to airlines and loyalty schemes. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by airline and loyalty scheme investors and the cost of debt is derived from both market data and industry gearing levels derived from comparable companies. CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors which are evaluated annually based on available market data. The pre-tax discount rate reflects the timing of future tax flows. The Group engages an external valuation expert as at the valuation date to assist in the determination of the post-tax discount rate.\n\nJet fuel price assumptions are derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter of each year and sourced externally from readily available market data at the valuation date. The cash flow forecasts reflect these price increases after taking into consideration the level of fuel derivatives and their associated prices that the Group has in place and the incremental price differentials expected for the purchase of SAF.\n\nAs detailed above, the Group adjusts the final year of the three-year business plans to incorporate the medium-term impacts of climate change from the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy through to 2030. These adjustments include the following key assumptions: (i) a 10 per cent level of SAF consumption out of the overall fuel mix with an assumed price of \u20ac3,412 per metric tonne; (ii) a kerosene tax of \u20ac526 per metric tonne on all intra-EU flights; (iii) for costs of carbon, prices of \u20ac173, \u20ac173, \u20ac110 and \u20ac19 for EU ETS allowances, Swiss ETS allowances, UK ETS allowances and CORSIA allowances, respectively, per tonne of CO2 equivalents emitted; and (iv) the removal of all free ETS and CORSIA allowances.\n\n## Summary of results\n\nAt 31 December 2023 management reviewed the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs and concluded the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying values.\n\nReasonable possible changes in key assumptions, both individually and in combination, have been considered for each CGU, where applicable, which include reducing the operating margin by 2 percentage points in each year, reducing ASKs by 5 percentage points in each year, reducing long-term growth rates in the terminal value calculation to zero, increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.5 percentage points and increasing the fuel price (both jet fuel and SAF) by 40 per cent, both with cost recovery consistent with that experienced historically and with no assumed cost recovery. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, these sensitivities represent a reasonably possible impact of climate change on the CGUs greater than that included in the impairment models.\n\nFor the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs, while the recoverable amounts are estimated to exceed the carrying amounts by \u20ac15,752 million, \u20ac4,736 million, \u20ac1,271 million and \u20ac1,884 million, respectively, the recoverable amounts would be below the carrying amounts when applying reasonable possible but not probable changes, over the forecast period, in assumptions in each of the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 British Airways: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 24 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 29 per cent higher without cost recovery;\n- \u00b7 Iberia: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 21 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 24 per cent higher without cost recovery;\n- \u00b7 Vueling: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 12 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 18 per cent higher without cost recovery; and\n- \u00b7 Aer Lingus: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 16 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 23 per cent higher without cost recovery.\n\nFor the remainder of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs and for all the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the IAG Loyalty CGU, no impairment arises.",

The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings held directly do not differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held. There have been no significant changes in ownership interests of subsidiaries during the year.\n\nThe total non-controlling interest at 31 December 2023 is \u20ac6 million (2022: \u20ac6 million).\n\n## b Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe share of assets, liabilities, revenue and profit of the Group's associates and joint ventures, which are included in the Group's financial statements, are as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total assets        | 166    | 148    |\n| Total liabilities   | (119)  | (104)  |\n| Revenue             | 107    | 89     |\n| Profit for the year | 6      | 5      |\n\nThe detail of the movement in investment in associates and joint ventures is shown as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At beginning of year      | 43     | 40     |\n| Share of retained profits | 6      | 5      |\n| Dividends received        | (2)    | (2)    |\n|                           | 47     | 43     |\n\nAt 31 December 2023 there are no restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to the parent and there are no related contingent liabilities.\n\nAt both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 the investment in Sociedad Conjunta para la Emisi\u00f3n y Gesti\u00f3n de Medios de Pago EFC, S.A. exceeded 50 per cent ownership by the Group (50.5 per cent). The entity is treated as a joint venture as decisions regarding its strategy and operations require the unanimous consent of the parties who share control, including IAG.\n\n## 19 Other equity investments\n\nOther equity investments include the following:\n\n| \u20ac million           |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Unlisted securities |    188 |     55 |\n|                     |    188 |     55 |\n\nThe credit relating to Other equity investments was \u20ac3 million (2022: charge of \u20ac3 million).\n\n## Investment in Air Europa Holdings\n\nOn 15 June 2022, the Group entered into a financing arrangement with Globalia Corporaci\u00f3n Empresarial, S,A, ('Globalia'), whereby, the Group provided a \u20ac100 million seven-year unsecured loan, which was convertible for a period of two years from inception into a fixed number of the shares of Air Europa Holdings, S.L. ('Air Europa Holdings'), a wholly owned subsidiary of Globalia. Subsequently, on 16 August 2022, the Group exercised its exchange option with Globalia and converted the aforementioned loan into an investment in 20 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings, which is recorded as an Other equity investment.\n\nOn 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings that it had not previously owned. The acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition authorities. Until the completion of these approvals, the acquisition does not meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and accordingly the Group continues to recognise the 20 per cent share capital ownership of Air Europa Holdings as an Other equity investment (see note 2 for critical judgement applied in this classification).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings was \u20ac129 million, representing an increase of \u20ac105 million from the \u20ac24 million recorded at 31 December 2022, with the fair value movement having been recorded within Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group, with its external valuation advisors, determined the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, using both the market approach and the income approach, whereby the Group used both observable market data and unobservable inputs. The fair value was determined on the stand-alone basis of Air Europa Holdings without consideration of potential synergies that could be obtained if the Group were able to obtain control over the operations of Air Europa Holdings.\n\nIn determining the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings at 31 December 2023, the Group used the following significant unobservable inputs: (i) revenue compound annual growth rate of 4.0 per cent; (ii) an EBITDA range of 3.6 to 6.5 per cent; and (iii) a risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 13.9 per cent.",

Avios are issued by the Group's airlines through their loyalty programmes, or are sold to third parties such as credit card providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programmes. While Avios do not have an expiry date and can be redeemed at any time in the future, a customer's membership account is closed if there is a period of 36 months of inactivity in terms of both issuances and redemptions. Revenue may therefore be recognised at any time in the future.\n\n## Unredeemed vouchers liability\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group recognised \u20ac645 million in respect of unredeemed vouchers, including associated taxes (2022: \u20ac911 million) within Deferred revenue. Of the \u20ac645 million, \u20ac139 million relates to vouchers issued due to COVID-19 pandemic flight cancellations, referred to as 'disrupted flights' and \u20ac506 million relates to non-disrupted voucher issuance, such as the British Airways 'Book with Confidence' policy (where customers were provided the flexibility to change their destination and/or date of travel on non-disrupted flights), certain other flexible fare options, non-air partner companion vouchers and gift vouchers.\n\nThe jurisdiction in which a voucher is issued, dictates the period over which a customer can redeem the voucher, which ranges up to six years from the point of issuance. This period of time is also influenced by whether the voucher was issued for disrupted flights or non-disrupted issuance and whether statutory or commercial expiry policies prevail. The Group expects the majority of the total voucher liability to mature within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\nDuring, and subsequent to, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group, across each of its operating companies, has engaged in marketing campaigns and direct customer engagement in an attempt to maximise redemption of these vouchers. Despite these efforts, the Group expects some of these vouchers to expire unredeemed. The Group estimates the number of these vouchers, both for disrupted flights and non-disrupted issuance, not expected to be redeemed prior to expiry using statistical modelling based on historical experience and expected future redemptions, recognising this estimated value as passenger revenue when it can be reasonably determined that there will not be a significant reversal of this revenue in future accounting periods.\n\nA 5 percentage point increase in the assumption of the number of vouchers outstanding at 31 December 2023 and not expected to be redeemed prior to expiry would result in a reduction to Deferred revenue of \u20ac32 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase Passenger revenue and Operating profit recognised in the year.\n\n## 25 Other long-term liabilities\n\n| \u20ac million                    |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-current trade creditors  |    164 |    147 |\n| Accruals and deferred income |     55 |     53 |\n|                              |    219 |    200 |",

        "page_content": "In addition, on 23 March 2021, the Group entered into a three-year US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility of $1.755 billion accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. On 23 August 2022, the Group extended the term of the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional 12 months through to March 2025. On 23 August 2023, of the $1.755 billion facility, the Group further extended the terms of the $1.655 billion Revolving Credit Facility by an additional 12 months through to March 2026 with the remaining $100 million available through to March 2025. As at 31 December 2023 no amounts had been drawn under the facility (2022: nil). While the Group does not forecast drawing down on the Revolving Credit Facility, should it do so, the resultant debt would be secured, in the respective operating companies, against: (i) specific landing rights; or (ii) aircraft; or (iii) or a combination of both.\n\n## Details of the 2028 convertible bond\n\nOn 11 May 2021, the Group issued the \u20ac825 million fixed rate 1.125 per cent senior unsecured bond convertible into ordinary shares of IAG. The convertible bond raised net proceeds of \u20ac818 million and matures in 2028. The Group holds an option to redeem the convertible bond at its principal amount, together with accrued interest, no earlier than two years prior to the final maturity date.\n\nThe convertible bond provides bondholders with dividend protection and includes a total of 244,850,715 options at inception and at 31 December 2023 to convert into ordinary shares of IAG. The Group also holds an option to redeem the convertible bond, in full or in part, in cash in the event that bondholders exercise their right to convert the bond into ordinary shares of IAG. The bondholders conversion right is currently exercisable.\n\nThe convertible bond is recorded at its fair value, which at 31 December 2023 was \u20ac735 million (2022: \u20ac605 million), representing an increase of \u20ac130 million since 1 January 2023. Of this increase, the charge recorded in Other comprehensive income arising from credit risk of the convertible bonds was \u20ac119 million and a charge recorded within Finance costs in the Income statement attributable to changes in market conditions of \u20ac11 million.\n\n## Transactions with unconsolidated entities\n\nThe Group has entered into asset financing transactions with unconsolidated entities as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2019-1 were entered into in the third quarter of 2019, recognising Asset financed liabilities of \u20ac725 million for eight aircraft that mature between 2029 and 2034;\n- \u00b7 The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1 were entered into in the fourth quarter of 2020, recognising Asset financed liabilities of \u20ac472 million for nine aircraft that mature between 2028 and 2032;\n- \u00b7 The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2021-1 were entered into in the third quarter of 2021, recognising Asset financed liabilities of \u20ac204 million for seven aircraft that mature between 2031 and 2035;\n- \u00b7 The Iberia Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1 were entered into in April 2022, recognising Asset financed liabilities of \u20ac680 million for five aircraft that mature between 2032 and 2036;\n- \u00b7 The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2022-1 were entered into in October 2022, recognising Asset financed liabilities of \u20ac159 million for four aircraft that mature between 2032 and 2036; and\n- \u00b7 There have been no asset financing transactions with unconsolidated entities during the year to 31 December 2023.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Asset financed liabilities include cumulative amounts of \u20ac2,948 million (2022: \u20ac2,983 million) and the associated assets recorded within Property, plant and equipment include cumulative amounts of \u20ac2,757 million (2022: \u20ac3,400 million) associated with transactions with unconsolidated structured entities having issued EETCs.",

        "page_content": "## Restoration and handback provisions\n\nProvisions for restoration and handback costs are maintained to meet the contractual maintenance and return conditions on aircraft held under lease. For those obligations arising on inception of an aircraft lease, the associated estimated cost is capitalised within the ROU asset. For those obligations that arise through usage or through the passage of time, the associated estimated costs are recognised in the Income statement as the associated asset is used or through the passage of time. The provision is long term in nature, typically covering the leased asset term, which for aircraft is up to 12 years.\n\nThe provisions also include an amount relating to leased land and buildings where restoration costs are contractually required at the end of the lease. Such costs are capitalised within ROU assets.\n\nThe provisions are determined by discounting the future cash flows using pre-tax risk-free rates specific to the tenor of the provision and the currency in which it arises. The unwinding of the discounting of the provisions is recorded as a finance cost in the Income statement (see note 9a).\n\nRemeasurements arising from changes in estimates relating to the effects of both discounting and inflation are recorded in the Income statement to the extent they relate to avoidable provisions or recorded as an adjustment to the right of use asset (see note 14) for those unavoidable provisions.\n\nWhere amounts are finalised and the uncertainty relating to these provisions removed, the associated liability is reclassified to either current or non-current Other creditors, dependent on the expecting timing of settlement.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe restructuring provision includes provisions for voluntary redundancies including the collective redundancy programme for Iberia's Transformation Plan implemented prior to 2023, which provides for payments to affected employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The amount provided for has been determined by an actuarial valuation made by independent actuaries, and was based on the same assumptions as those made to determine the provisions for obligations to flight crew below, with the exception of the discount rate, which in this case was 3.2 per cent. The payments related to this provision will continue over the next six years.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, \u20ac88 million of this provision related to collective redundancy programmes (2022: \u20ac185 million).\n\n## Employee leaving indemnities and other employee related provisions\n\nThis provision includes employee leaving indemnities relating to staff under various contractual arrangements. As part of these provisions, the Group recognises provisions relating to the Iberia flight crew (both pilots and cabin crew):\n\n- \u00b7 Pilots - under the relevant collective bargaining agreement, pilots have the option at the age of 60 to elect to: continue in full-time employment; being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age (referred to as 'active'); or alternatively taking early retirement (referred to as 'inactive'). Additionally, and in certain cases, those pilots from the age of 55, may apply for retaining their employment relationship, but with reduced activity (referred to as 'special leave'); and\n- \u00b7 Cabin crew - under the relevant collective bargaining agreement, cabin crew have the option at the age of 62 to elect to: continue in full-time employment; being transferred to active status; or being transferred to inactive status. Additionally, and in certain cases, those cabin crew employees from the age of 57, may apply for 'special leave'.\n\nThe Group is required to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. In determining the provision to be recognised for the proportion of employees that will elect either special leave or to be inactive, the Group estimates a number of financial assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) medium to long-term salary growth and inflation; (ii) the discount rate to apply; (iii) the rate of public social security growth; (iv) mortality rates; and (v) staff turnover.\n\nThe provision was re-assessed at 31 December 2023 with the use of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on a discount rate consistent with the iBoxx index of 3.17 per cent for active employees and 2.98 per cent for inactive employees (2022: iBoxx index of 3.72 per cent and 3.50 per cent, respectively), the PER\\_Col\\_2020.1er.orden. mortality tables, and assuming contractual salary increases of up to 3.8 per cent in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025 and then 2.0 per cent per annum thereafter derived from increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). At 31 December 2023, there were a total of 5,179 flight crew (31 December 2022: 4,827) eligible for making such elections when they reach the age of 60. At 31 December 2023, there were 479 employees who had not reached the age of retirement, and eligible to elect for early retirement ('special leave') who had elected to become inactive (31 December 2022: 426). In addition, at 31 December 2023, there were 25 employees having reached the age of retirement, who had elected to become inactive (31 December 2022: 15).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the average length of employment of the eligible flight crew was 17 years (31 December 2022: 18 years). This is mainly a long-term provision. Remeasurements in the valuation of this provision are recorded in Other comprehensive income. The amount relating to this provision was \u20ac677 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac611 million).\n\n## Legal claims and contractual disputes provisions\n\nLegal claims and contractual disputes provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 amounts for multi-party claims from groups of employees on a number of matters related to their employment, including claims for additional holiday pay and for age discrimination;\n- \u00b7 amounts related to ongoing contractual disputes arising from the Group's operations; and\n- \u00b7 amounts related to investigations by a number of competition authorities in connection with alleged anti-competitive activity concerning the Group's passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nThe final amount required to settle the remaining claims and fines is subject to uncertainty.\n\n## ETS provisions\n\nETS provisions relate to the Emissions Trading Scheme for CO2 equivalent emitted on flights within the EU, Switzerland and the UK and due to be extinguished in the year subsequent to the reporting date through settlement with the relevant authorities.

        "page_content": "## 28 Contingent liabilities\n\nThere are a number of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Group in a number of jurisdictions which at 31 December 2023, where they could be reliably estimated, but excluding the Vueling hand luggage matter detailed below, amounted to \u20ac58 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac11 million). The Group does not consider it probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources with regard to these proceedings and accordingly no provisions have been recorded.\n\nContingent liabilities associated with income taxes, deferred taxes and indirect taxes are presented in note 10.\n\n## Included in contingent liabilities is the following:\n\n## Air Europa Holdings acquisition break-fee\n\nOn 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings from Globalia that it had not previously owned. The acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition authorities.\n\nIn the event that the relevant approvals, detailed above, are not forthcoming within 24 months of entering into the agreement or the Group terminates the agreement at any time prior to completion, then the Group is required to pay a break-fee to Globalia of \u20ac50 million. Under the agreement, this 24-month period can be extended, by mutual consent.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and through to the date of the consolidated financial statements, the Group considers that it is probable that the acquisition will successfully complete and accordingly does not consider it probable that the break-fee shall be paid. Given the above the Group does not consider it appropriate to record a provision for the break-fee.\n\n## Vueling commercial hand luggage policy\n\nIn the year ended 31 December 2023, Vueling received a number of information requests from the Ministerio de Consumo (Ministry of Consumer Affairs) in Spain, with regard to its commercial hand luggage policy, for which Vueling complied with. On 12 January 2024, the Ministerio de Consumo issued Vueling with a List of Charges asserting that the Vueling commercial hand luggage policy infringes consumers rights under Article 47.1 of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007. While the List of Charges notifies Vueling of its intention to sanction the company for such infringements, it stipulates that the basis for determining such penalties is subject to the provision of further information by the company. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate reliably any exposure that may arise from this matter until ongoing proceedings with the Ministerio de Consumo are further progressed. The Group, with its advisors, has reviewed the correspondence and List of Charges from the Ministerio de Consumo and considers it has strong arguments to support its commercial hand luggage policy and does not consider it probable that an adverse outcome will result in the future. As such, the Group does not consider it appropriate to record any provision. The Group expects further developments on this matter during the remainder of 2024.\n\n## 29 Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fuel price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal impacts of these on the financial statements are discussed below:\n\n## a Fuel price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to fuel price risk. In order to mitigate such risk, under the Group's fuel price risk management strategy a variety of over the counter derivative instruments are entered into. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of fuel consumption up to two years within the approved hedging profile.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's principal exposure to a reasonable possible change in the fuel price, based on current market volatility, with all other variables held constant on the profit before tax and equity 1 .

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company and by only entering into transactions with counterparties with a very low credit risk.\n\nAt each period end, the Group assesses the effect of counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and any ineffectiveness arising is immediately recognised in the Income statement within Other non-operating credits.",

For the year to 31 December 2023, the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items was 1.7 times (2022: 3.1 times). The definition and calculation for this performance measure is included in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\nFurther detail on liquidity and capital resources and capital risk management is disclosed in the going concern section in note 2.",

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. Level 1 methodologies (market values at the balance sheet date) were used to determine the fair value of listed asset investments classified as equity investments and listed interest-bearing borrowings. The fair value of financial liabilities and financial assets incorporates own credit risk and counterparty credit risk, respectively.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.\n\nDerivative instruments are measured based on the market value of instruments with similar terms and conditions using forward pricing models, which include forward exchange rates, forward interest rates, forward fuel curves and corresponding volatility surface data at the reporting date. The fair value of the principal derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows, incorporating adjustments for own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:\n\n- \u00b7 commodity reference contracts including swaps and options transactions, referenced to: (i) CIF NWE cargoes jet fuel; (ii) ICE Gasoil; (iii) ICE Brent; (iv) ICE Gasoil Brent crack; (v) Jet Differential and (vi) Jet fuel Brent crack - the mark-to-market valuation prices are determined by reference to current forward curve and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate;\n- \u00b7 currency forward and option contracts - by reference to current forward prices and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate; and\n- \u00b7 interest rate swap contracts - by discounting the future cash flows of the swap contracts at market interest rate valued with the current forward curve.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings, excluding lease liabilities, is determined by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows at the relevant market interest rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings is adjusted for own credit risk.\n\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The principal method of such valuation is performed using a valuation model that considers the present value of the dividend cash flows expected to be generated by the associated assets. For other equity investments where cash flow information is not available, an adjusted net asset method is applied. For the methodology in the determination of the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings, see note 19.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other current interest-bearing deposits, trade receivables, other current assets and trade and other payables approximate their carrying value largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.",

There have been no other transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.\n\n## d Hedges\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's principal risk management activities that were hedging future forecast transactions were:\n\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange contracts, hedging foreign currency exchange risk on cash inflows and certain operational payments. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement, where the hedged item is recorded directly in the Income statement, to the same caption as the underlying hedged item is classified; (ii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, are recorded to the Balance sheet to the same caption as the hedged item is recognised; and (iii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement, where the hedged item is a financial asset or liability, at the same time as the financial asset or liability is recorded in the Income statement. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the Income statement when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur and recorded in the relevant Income statement caption to which the hedged item is classified;\n- \u00b7 crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts, hedging price risk on fuel expenditure. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are: (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges to match against the related fuel cash outflow, where the underlying hedged item does not give rise to the recognition of fuel inventory; and (ii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet within Inventory, where the underlying hedged item is fuel inventory. Gains and losses recorded within Inventory are recognised in the Income statement when the underlying fuel inventory is consumed, within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur;\n- \u00b7 interest rate contracts, hedging interest rate risk on floating rate debt and certain operational payments. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Interest expense; and\n- \u00b7 future loan repayments denominated in foreign currency are designated in a hedge relationship hedging foreign exchange fluctuations on revenue cash inflows. Remeasurement gains and losses on the associated loans are recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability when the loan repayments are made (generally in instalments over the life of the loan).\n\nThe amounts included in equity are summarised below:\n\nLosses/(gains) in respect of cash flow hedges included within equity\n\n| \u20ac million                                                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loan repayments to hedge future revenue                              | 22     | 87     |\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and expenditure 1 | 94     | (178)  |\n| Crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts 1               | 67     | (127)  |\n| Derivatives used to hedge interest rates 1                           | (1)    | (46)   |\n| Instruments for which hedge accounting no longer applies 1, 2        | 123    | 213    |\n|                                                                      | 305    | (51)   |\n| Related deferred tax (credit)/charge                                 | (75)   | 20     |\n| Total amount included within equity                                  | 230    | (31)   |",

A total of 3.3 million shares (2022: 8.1 million) were issued to employees during the year as a result of vesting of employee share schemes. At 31 December 2023 the Group held 55.8 million shares (2022: 17.1 million) which represented 1.12 per cent (2022: 0.34 per cent) of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 32 Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates share-based payment schemes as part of the total remuneration package provided to employees. These schemes comprise both share option schemes where employees acquire shares at an option price and share award plans whereby shares are issued to employees at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.\n\n## a IAG Performance Share Plan\n\nThe IAG Performance Share Plan (PSP) was granted to senior executives and managers of the Group who are most directly involved in shaping and delivering business success over the medium to long term. Awards made from 2015 to 2020 were nil-cost options, with a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. All awards had three independent performance measures with equal weighting: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure Index (2020 awards) or MSCI European Transportation Index (prior to 2020 awards), earnings per share, and Return on Invested Capital.\n\n## b IAG Restricted Share Plan\n\nThe IAG Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was introduced in 2021 to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the Group's senior management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an increased focus on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Group. Awards have been made as conditional awards, with a twoyear holding period following the three-year vesting period. There are no performance measures associated with the awards. Vesting will be contingent on the satisfaction of a discretionary underpin, normally assessed over three financial years commencing from the financial year in which the award was granted. Approval at the end of the vesting period will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, considering the Group's overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures over the course of the vesting period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified.\n\n## c IAG Full Potential Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2021, the Group launched the Full Potential Incentive Plan (FPIP), which was granted to key individuals involved in the delivery of a series of transformation projects that will enable the Group to deliver business success over the medium to long term. The awards have been made as conditional awards, vesting in 2025 and dependent on stretch performance targets for 2024 and the approval of the Board.\n\n## d IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan\n\nThe IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) is granted to qualifying employees based on performance and service tests. It will be awarded when an annual incentive award is triggered subject to the employee remaining in employment with the Group for three years after the grant date. The relevant population will receive 50 per cent of their incentive award up front in cash, and the remaining 50 per cent in shares after three years through the IADP.",

        "page_content": "## 34 Employee benefit obligations\n\nThe Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The Group also has a scheme for flight crew who meet certain conditions and therefore have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement (see note 27).\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees.\n\nCosts recognised in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Spain, UK and Ireland for the year to 31 December 2023 were \u20ac279 million (2022: \u20ac251 million).\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe principal funded defined benefit pension schemes within the Group are the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), both of which are in the UK and are closed to new members.\n\nAPS has been closed to new members since 1984, but remains open to future accrual. The benefits provided under APS are based on final average pensionable pay and, for the majority of members, are subject to inflationary increases in payment.\n\nNAPS has been closed to new members since 2003 and closed to future accrual since 2018. Following closure, members' deferred pensions are increased annually by inflation up to 5 per cent per annum (measured using the Government's annual Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on CPI).\n\nAPS and NAPS are governed by separate Trustee Boards. Although APS and NAPS have separate Trustee Boards, certain aspects of the business of the two schemes are common. APS and NAPS have developed certain joint working groups that are attended by the Trustee Board members of each scheme although each Trustee Board reaches its decisions independently. There are subcommittees which are separately responsible for the governance, operation and investments of each scheme. British Airways Pension Trustees Limited holds the assets of both schemes on behalf of their respective Trustees.\n\nTriennially, the Trustees of APS and NAPS undertake actuarial valuations, which are subsequently agreed with British Airways to determine the cash contributions and any deficit payment plans through to the next valuation date, as well as ensuring that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. These actuarial valuations are prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation. This differs from the IAS 19 'Employee benefits' valuation, which is used for deriving the Income statement and Balance sheet positions and uses a best-estimate approach overall. The different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and funding levels.\n\nDuring 2022, the triennial valuations, as at 31 March 2021, were finalised for APS and NAPS which resulted in a technical surplus of \u20ac343 million (\u00a3295 million) for APS and a technical deficit of \u20ac1,887 million (\u00a31,650 million) for NAPS. The actuarial valuations performed for APS and NAPS are different to the valuation performed as at 31 December 2023 under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' mainly due to timing differences of the measurement dates and to the specific scheme assumptions in the actuarial valuation performed as at 31 March 2021 compared with IAS 19 requirements used in the accounting valuation assumptions as at the reporting date. The actuarial valuation of neither APS and NAPS is updated outside of the triennial valuations, making comparability between the scheme liabilities applying the principles set out in the UK Pension legislation and the requirements of IAS 19 not possible. The principal difference relates to the discount rate applied, which under the triennial actuarial valuation, aligns with a prudent estimate of the future investment returns on the assets of the respective schemes, whereas, under IAS 19, the rates are based on high-quality corporate bond yields, regardless of how the assets are invested.\n\nThe triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021 for NAPS supersedes the previous agreements reached in 2020 and 2021 between British Airways and the Trustee of NAPS relating to the deferral of deficit contributions. The deferred deficit contributions have been incorporated into the deficit payment plan agreed as part of the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021.\n\nAs part of the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021 for NAPS, British Airways has agreed to provide certain property assets as security, which will remain in place until 30 September 2028.\n\n## Other plans\n\nBritish Airways also operates post-retirement schemes in a number of jurisdictions outside of the UK. The principal scheme is the British Airways Plc Pension Plan (USA) based in the United States and referred to as the 'US Plan'. The US Plan is considered to be a defined benefit scheme and is closed to new members and to future accrual.\n\nThe majority of British Airways' other plans are fully funded, but there are also a number of unfunded plans, for which the Group meets the benefit payment obligations as they fall due.\n\nIn addition, Aer Lingus operates certain defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded.",

        "page_content": "## Risk associated with the defined benefit schemes\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a range of risks, with the following being the most significant:\n\n- \u00b7 asset volatility risk - the scheme obligations are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond yields. If scheme assets underperform this yield, this will reduce the surplus / increase the deficit, depending on the scheme. Certain of the schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while creating volatility and risk in the short term;\n- \u00b7 longevity risk - the majority of the scheme obligations are to provide benefits over the life of the scheme members. An increase in life expectancy will result in a corresponding increase in the defined benefit obligation;\n- \u00b7 interest rate risk - a decrease in interest rates will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of certain of the scheme assets;\n- \u00b7 inflation risk - a significant proportion of the scheme obligations are linked to inflation, such that any increase in inflation will cause an increase in the obligations. While certain of the scheme assets are indexed to inflation, any expected increase in the scheme assets from inflation would be disproportionately lower than the increase in the scheme obligations; and\n- \u00b7 currency risk - a number of scheme assets are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. Weakening of those currencies, or strengthening of the pound sterling, in the long term, will have the effect of reducing the value of scheme assets.\n\n## a Cash payments and funding arrangements\n\nCash payments in respect to pension obligations comprise normal employer contributions by the Group and deficit contributions based on the agreed deficit payment plan with NAPS. Total payments for the year to 31 December 2023 net of service costs made by the Group were \u20ac48 million (2022: \u20ac20 million) being the employer contributions of \u20ac49 million (2022: \u20ac22 million) less the current service cost of \u20ac1 million (2022: \u20ac2 million) (note 34b,c).\n\n## Future funding arrangements\n\nPension contributions for APS and NAPS were determined by actuarial valuations made at 31 March 2021, using assumptions and methodologies agreed between the Group and Trustee of each scheme.\n\nIn total, the Group expects to pay \u20ac1 million in employer contributions to APS and NAPS in 2024.\n\nThe following graph provides the undiscounted benefit payments to be made by the Trustees of APS and NAPS over the remaining expected duration of the schemes:\n\n## Projected benefit payments from the reporting date (\u20ac million, unaudited)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nn\n\nAPS\n\nn\n\nNAPS\n\nThe amounts and timing of these projected benefit payments are subject to the aforementioned risks to the schemes.\n\n## Deficit contributions\n\nAt the date of the actuarial valuation, the actuarial deficit of NAPS amounted to \u20ac1,887 million. In order to address the deficit in the scheme, the Group committed to deficit contribution payments through to 30 June 2023, amounting to approximately \u20ac58 million per year, increasing by \u20ac58 million each year up to 30 June 2026 and subsequently capped at \u20ac257 million per year through to 31 May 2032. The deficit contribution plan includes an over-funding protection mechanism, based on the triennial valuation methodology for measuring the deficit, whereby deficit contributions are suspended if the funding position reaches 100 per cent, with a mechanism for contributions to resume if the contribution level subsequently falls below 100 per cent, or until such point as the scheme funding level reaches 100 per cent.\n\nDuring the year ended and as at 31 December 2023, the NAPS funding position exceeded 100 per cent and accordingly deficit contributions were suspended. At 31 December 2023, the valuation of the funding level incorporates significant forwardlooking assumptions, such that the Group currently does not expect to make further deficit contributions. Given the long-term nature of the NAPS scheme, these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and there can be no guarantee that deficit contributions will not resume in the future or that additional deficit contributions will not need to be incorporated into future triennial actuarial valuations.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, had the over-funding protection mechanism not been applied, then the asset ceiling adjustment (as detailed in note 34c) would have been \u20ac638 million higher, reducing the surplus accordingly.",

In the period from 1 January to 31 December 2024, any dividends paid by British Airways will be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. In the period from 1 January to 30 September 2025, any dividend payment from British Airways to IAG that exceeds 50 per cent of the pre-exceptional profit after tax in each financial year will require additional payments to be made to NAPS if the scheme is not at least 100 per cent funded. All dividend restrictions cease from 1 October 2025, onwards. British Airways must maintain a minimum cash level of \u20ac1,854 million (\u00a31,600 million) as at the date of the declaration of any dividends as well as immediately following the payment of any dividends to IAG and the associated matching contributions to NAPS. The amount of any deficit contributions and dividend matching contributions in a single financial year is limited to \u20ac348 million (\u00a3300 million).\n\n## b Employee benefit scheme amounts recognised in the financial statements\n\n## i Amounts recognised on the Balance sheet\n\n|                                       | 2023    | 2023     | 2023   | 2023     |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|--------|----------|\n| \u20ac million                             | APS     | NAPS     | Other  | Total    |\n| Scheme assets at fair value 1         | 6,070   | 16,724   | 393    | 23,187   |\n| Present value of scheme liabilities 1 | (6,048) | (14,644) | (547)  | (21,239) |\n| Net pension asset/(liability)         | 22      | 2,080    | (154)  | 1,948    |\n| Effect of the asset ceiling 2         | (7)     | (728)    | -      | (735)    |\n| Other employee benefit obligations    | -       | -        | (8)    | (8)      |\n| 31 December 2023                      | 15      | 1,352    | (162)  | 1,205    |\n| Represented by:                       |         |          |        |          |\n| Employee benefit asset                |         |          |        | 1,380    |\n| Employee benefit obligation           |         |          |        | (175)    |\n| Net employee benefit asset 3          |         |          |        | 1,205    |\n\n|                                       | 2022    | 2022     | 2022   | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|----------|--------|----------|\n| \u20ac million                             | APS     | NAPS     | Other  | Total    |\n| Scheme assets at fair value 1         | 6,283   | 17,029   | 356    | 23,668   |\n| Present value of scheme liabilities 1 | (6,052) | (13,692) | (548)  | (20,292) |\n| Net pension asset/(liability)         | 231     | 3,337    | (192)  | 3,376    |\n| Effect of the asset ceiling 2         | (80)    | (1,168)  | -      | (1,248)  |\n| Other employee benefit obligations    | -       | -        | (11)   | (11)     |\n| 31 December 2022                      | 151     | 2,169    | (203)  | 2,117    |\n| Represented by:                       |         |          |        |          |\n| Employee benefit asset                |         |          |        | 2,334    |\n| Employee benefit obligation           |         |          |        | (217)    |\n| Net employee benefit asset 3          |         |          |        | 2,117    |",

The latter is a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in the projected benefit obligation over time. The Trustees' investment committee adopts an annual business plan which sets out investment objectives and work required to support achievement of these objectives. The committee also deals with the monitoring of performance and activities, including work on developing the strategic benchmark to improve the risk return profile of the scheme where possible, as well as having a trigger-based dynamic governance process to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The investment committee reviews the existing investment restrictions, performance benchmarks and targets, as well as continuing to develop the de-risking and liability hedging portfolio.\n\nBoth schemes use derivative instruments for investment purposes and to manage exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange, longevity and liquidity risks arising in the normal course of business. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of Inflation-Linked Swap contracts. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Longevity risk is managed through the use of buy-in insurance contracts, asset swaps and longevity swaps.\n\nAlong with existing contracts with Rothesay Life (as detailed in note 34c(iii)), APS is 90 per cent protected against all longevity risk and fully protected in relation to all pensions that were already being paid as at 31 March 2018. APS is nearly 90 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation (on a Retail Price Index basis). NAPS is 95 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation (on a Consumer Price Index basis).\n\nThe assets held by APS and NAPS are split between 'return seeking assets' and 'liability matching assets' depending on the maturity of each scheme. At 31 December 2023, the actual asset allocation for NAPS was 19 per cent (2022: 31 per cent) in return seeking assets and 81 per cent (2022: 69 per cent) in liability matching investments. For NAPS, the Trustee agreed an updated investment framework with British Airways as part of the Scheme's 31 March 2021 actuarial valuation agreement. The Trustee aims towards an overall asset allocation with an agreed modest expected return relative to liabilities, and sufficient liquidity to manage investment risk appropriately on an on-going basis. The actual asset allocation for APS at 31 December 2023 was 1 per cent (2022: 1 per cent) in return seeking assets and 99 per cent (2022: 99 per cent) in liability matching investments. NAPS uses Liability Driven Investments (LDIs) to effectively hedge volatility in the scheme liabilities. This is achieved through direct bond holdings as opposed to the use of derivatives and as such leverage is low. Accordingly, as at 31 December 2023, NAPS has not been required to raise additional cash or liquidate existing assets in order to fund derivative positions.",

The dates of these valuations typically precede the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the date of the valuation and the reporting date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated through to the reporting date unless there are indications of significant market movements.\n- \u00b7 properties are valued based on an analysis of recent market transactions supported by market knowledge derived from thirdparty professional valuers that generally result in the use of significant unobservable inputs.\n- \u00b7 alternative investments fair values, which predominantly include holdings in investment and infrastructure funds are determined based on the most recent available valuations applying the Net Asset Value methodology and issued by fund administrators or investment managers and adjusted for any cash movements having occurred from the date of the valuation to the reporting date. The dates of these valuations typically precede the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the date of the valuation and the reporting date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated through to the reporting date unless there are indications of significant market movements.\n- \u00b7 other investments predominantly includes: interest receivable on bonds; dividends from listed and private equities that have been declared but not received at the balance sheet date; receivables from the sale of assets for which the proceeds have not been collected at the balance sheet date; and payables for the purchase of assets which have not been settled at the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 derivative financial instruments are entered into predominantly to mitigate interest rate and inflation rate risks. These derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value using pricing models and relevant market data as at the balance sheet date.\n- \u00b7 asset and longevity swaps - APS has a contract with Rothesay Life, entered into in 2010 and extended in 2013, which covers 25 per cent (2022: 25 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for an agreed list of members. Under the contract, to reduce the risk of longterm longevity risk, Rothesay Life makes benefit payments monthly in respect of the agreed list of members in return for the contractual return receivable on a portfolio of assets (made up of quoted government debt) held by the scheme and the contractual payments made by APS to Rothesay Life on the longevity swaps. The Group holds the portfolio of assets at their fair value, with the government debt held at their quoted market price and the swaps accounted for at their estimated discounted future cash flows.\n- During 2011, APS entered into a longevity swap with Rothesay Life, which covers an additional 21 per cent (2022: 21 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for the same agreed list of members as the 2010 contract. Under the longevity swap, to reduce the risk of long-term longevity risk, APS makes a fixed payment to Rothesay Life each month reflecting the prevailing mortality assumptions at the inception of the contract, and Rothesay Life make a monthly payment to APS reflecting the actual monthly benefit payments to members. The cash flows are settled net each month. If pensioners live longer than expected at inception of the longevity swap, Rothesay Life will make payments to the scheme to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners and if pensioners do not live as long as expected, then the scheme will make payments to Rothesay Life. The Group holds the longevity swap at fair value, determined at the estimated discounted future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 insurance contract - During 2018 the Trustee of APS secured a buy-in contract with Legal & General. The buy-in contract covers all members in receipt of pensions from APS at 31 March 2018, excluding dependent children, receiving a pension at that date and members in receipt of equivalent pension only benefits, who were alive on 1 October 2018. Benefits coming into payment for retirements after 31 March 2018 are not covered. The contract covers benefits payable from 1 October 2018 onwards. The policy covers approximately 60 per cent of all benefits APS expects to pay out in future.\n\n## iv Effect of the asset ceiling\n\nIn measuring the valuation of the net defined benefit asset for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan. The Group has determined that the recoverability of such surpluses, including minimum funding requirements, will be subject to withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, of 35 per cent.\n\nThe future committed NAPS deficit contributions, as detailed in note 34a, are treated as minimum funding requirements under IAS 19 and are not recognised as part of the scheme assets or liabilities. The Group has determined that upon the wind up of the scheme, that if the scheme is in surplus, including the incorporation of the minimum funding requirements, then the surplus will be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the scheme. The recovery of such amounts is subject to UK withholding tax payable by the Trustee. In measuring the recoverability of the surplus for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available upon wind up of the scheme, less the application of withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, at 35 per cent.\n\nA reconciliation of the effect of the asset ceiling used in calculating the IAS 19 irrecoverable surplus in APS and NAPS is set out below:\n\n| \u20ac million          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1 January          | 1,248  | 1,247  |\n| Interest expense   | 59     | 23     |\n| Remeasurements     | (583)  | 14     |\n| Exchange movements | 11     | (36)   |\n| 31 December        | 735    | 1,248  |\n\nOn 22 November 2023, the UK Government announced that it intended to reduce the withholding tax payable upon winding up of pension schemes from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. While this change had not been substantively enacted at the reporting date and as such not reflected in the figures above, had the rate of withholding tax been reduced to 25 per cent at 31 December 2023, the effect would have been to reduce the effect of the asset ceiling by \u20ac210 million to \u20ac525 million, with a corresponding increase in the net employee benefit asset.",

For NAPS, the base mortality tables are based on analysis undertaken for the purpose of the triennial valuation dated 31 March 2021. Future mortality improvements reflect the most recent model published by the UK actuarial profession's Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI), being its 2022 model. These standard mortality tables, for both APS and NAPS, incorporate adjustments specific to the demographics of scheme members, including a long-term improvement parameter of 1.00 per cent per annum (2022: 1.00 per cent).\n\nFor schemes in the United States, mortality rates were based on the MP-2021 mortality tables incorporating adjustments for the long-term impact COVID-19 is expected to have on mortality.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 9 years for APS (2022: 10 years) and 14 years for NAPS (2022: 15 years). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations was 2 to 16 years for other schemes (2022: 3 to 19 years). The weighted average duration represents a single figure for the average number of years over which the employee benefit liability discounted cash flows is extinguished and is highly dependent on movements in the aforementioned discount rates.",

These changes have been applied retrospectively to the Cash flow statement and are detailed below.\n\n## Net gain on sale of property plant and equipment\n\nPreviously gains/losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment were recorded in the Income statement within Other nonoperating credits. Under the updated presentation, Net (gain)/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment is presented separately in the Income statement and included within Operating profit. Accordingly, operating profit included within Net cash flows from operating activities has been updated. See note 2 for further information.\n\n## Unrealised currency differences\n\nPreviously all unrealised foreign currency gains/losses arising in the Cash flow statement were recorded within Net foreign exchange differences. Under the updated presentation, Net foreign exchange differences has been amended to only include those unrealised currency differences arising from the retranslation of opening cash and cash equivalent balances, while unrealised currency differences arising from working capital used in operating activities are presented within Net cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Other cash flows from operating activities\n\nPreviously movements in working capital balances were presented aggregated between working capital assets and working capital liabilities. Under the updated presentation working capital balances have been disaggregated by their nature to allow greater visibility as to the cash flow impacts associated with these balances. There has been no change in the overall total movement in working capital.\n\nIn addition, previously the Group presented the non-cash movements in provisions combined with other non-cash movements. Under the updated presentation these items have been separated into individual row items within the Cash flow statement.",

        "page_content": "## 38 Post balance sheet events\n\n## Revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 in Spain\n\nOn 18 January 2024 the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) in Spain, issued a ruling that a number of the amendments to corporate income tax arising from the introduction of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional and accordingly revoked. The revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 impacts the Groups operations as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Limitation of the use of historic tax losses\n\nPrior to the introduction of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, the Spanish subsidiaries of the Group were permitted to offset up to 70 per cent of their taxable profit with historical accumulated tax losses (to the extent there were sufficient tax losses to do so). With the introduction of the Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, this limitation of tax losses applied to taxable profit was reduced to 25 per cent.\n\n- \u00b7 Tax deductibility of impairments of investment in subsidiary undertakings\n- Where companies had impaired investments in subsidiaries prior to 2013 and deducted those impairments for tax purposes, Royal\n\nDecree-Law 3/2016 retrospectively required companies to reverse those impairment charges, for tax purposes, with the effect recognised equally over the five years commencing 1 January 2016.\n\nThe Group does not consider that the ruling by the Tribunal Constitucional constitutes an adjusting post-balance sheet event and accordingly the impact of these changes are not reflected in the financial statements. As at the date of these financial statements, there remains uncertainty as to how the revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 will be applied and accordingly the methodology by which the Group, with its external tax advisors, quantifies the impacts of this revocation. Had the Group reflected the impact of ruling into the financial statements as at 31 December 2023, the impact would have been as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Current tax impact of historic loss limitation and deductibility of historic impairments of investments for fiscal years 2016 through 2022\n\nThe Royal Decree Law 3/2016 restricted the use of prior year tax losses to 25 per cent of current year profits in the Group's Spanish companies. In addition, prior to 2013, Iberia impaired its subsidiary undertakings in Venezuela. Had the loss limitation been 70 per cent and the historic impairment been tax deductible, the tax paid to the Spanish tax authorities, would have been up to approximately \u20ac83 million lower. The Group expects to record an associated current tax credit, with a corresponding receivable from the Spanish tax authorities. The Group is currently assessing the potential interest due, if any, from the Spanish tax authorities arising on this receivable.\n\n- \u00b7 Current tax impact of loss limitation for fiscal year 2023\n\nThe Group measures current tax expense based on the regulations in effect as of the date when corporate income taxes are accrued. With the change in loss limitation, the Group anticipates the ability to offset up to 70 per cent of their Spanish taxable profits with prior-year losses for their 2023 Spanish taxes. If this limit had been applied at 31 December 2023 the Group foresees a reduction in the 2023 current tax expense of approximately \u20ac108 million.\n\n## \u00b7 Deferred tax impact of future loss limitation\n\nThe Group measures deferred tax assets at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised. As detailed in note 2, the Group uses future cash flow projections over periods of up to ten years to determine the recoverability of deferred tax assets. With the change in loss limitation, the Group expects to be able to utilise more of its historical tax losses within this tenyear period. Had the Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 not applied at 31 December 2023, the Group expects that the deferred tax assets of the Group, attributable to tax losses and tax credits, would have decreased by approximately \u20ac58 million, with a corresponding charge to Tax in the Income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures\n\nThe performance of the Group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures (APMs), some of which have been identified as key performance indicators of the Group. These measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements, may differ to definitions given by regulatory bodies applicable to the Group and may differ to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Further information on why these APMs are used is provided in the Key performance indicators section. They are used to measure the outcome of the Group's strategy based on the Group's strategic imperatives of: strengthening our core; driving earnings growth through asset-light businesses; and operating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group has replaced the Levered free cash flow measure with the Free cash flow measure. The Free cash flow measure represents the cash generating ability of the Group to support operations and maintain its capital assets. This measure is monitored by the Group in making both investment and capital decisions. In addition, the Group has added an APM regarding the Ownership costs of the Group to enable a better understanding of how the capital assets of the Group contribute to the operating result in each reporting period. Other than the aforementioned change, the Group has made no changes to its pre-existing disclosures and treatments of APMs compared to those disclosed in the Annual report and accounts for the year to 31 December 2022.\n\nThe definition of each APM, together with a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.\n\n## a Profit after tax before exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in the Board's and management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to supplement the understanding of the entity's financial performance. The Management Committee of the Group uses financial performance on a pre-exceptional basis to evaluate operating performance and to make strategic, financial and operational decisions, and externally because it is widely used by security analysts and investors in evaluating the performance of the Group between reporting periods and against other companies.\n\nWhile there have been no exceptional items recorded in the year to 31 December 2023, exceptional items in the year to 31 December 2022 include: significant changes in the long-term fleet plans that result in the reversal of impairment of fleet assets and legal reimbursements.\n\nThe table below reconciles the statutory Income statement to the Income statement before exceptional items of the Group:\n\n|                                                     | Year to 31 December   | Year to 31 December   | Year to 31 December           | Year to 31 December   | Year to 31 December   | Year to 31 December             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                           | Statutory 2023        | Exceptional items     | Before exceptional items 2023 | Statutory 2022 1      | Exceptional items     | Before exceptional items 2022 1 |\n| Passenger revenue                                   | 25,810                | -

The exceptional credit has been recorded within Property, IT and other costs in the Income statement with no resultant tax charge arising. The cash inflow associated with the partial reversal of the fine was recognised during 2022.\n\n- 3 Impairment reversal of fleet and associated assets\n\nThe exceptional impairment reversal of \u20ac8 million for the year to 31 December 2022 relates to six Airbus A320s in Vueling, previously stood down in the fourth quarter of 2020 and subsequently stood up in the second and third quarters of 2022. The exceptional impairment reversal was recorded within Right of use assets on the Balance sheet and within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.\n\nThere is no cash flow impact and there has been a tax charge of \u20ac2 million on the recognition of the impairment reversal.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of the statutory to pre-exceptional condensed alternative income statement by operating segment for the years to 31 December 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                        | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus      | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   | Year to 31 December 2023 Iberia Vueling Aer Lingus   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | British Airways (\u00a3)                                  | British Airways (\u00a3)                                  | British Airways (\u20ac)                                  | British Airways (\u20ac)                                  | British Airways (\u20ac)                                  |                                                      |                                                         |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n| Million                                | S ta tu to ry                                        | ite m s Bef or e  exc ept i onal ite m s             | S ta tu to ry                                        | Exc ept i onal ite m s                               | Bef or e  exc ept i onal ite m s                     | S ta tu to ry                                        | Exc ept i onal ite m s Bef or e  exc ept i onal ite m s | S ta tu to ry                                        | Exc ept i onal ite m s                               | Bef or e  exc ept i onal ite m s                     | S ta tu to ry                                        | Exc ept i onal ite m s                               | Bef or e  exc ept i onal ite m s                     |\n| Passenger revenue                      | 12,668                                               | -

As fuel costs can vary with commodity prices, the Group monitors fuel and non-fuel costs individually. Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating Other revenue, which typically do not represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other airlines, non-flight products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue streams. Airline nonfuel costs per ASK is defined as total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges and less non-flight specific costs divided by total available seat kilometres (ASKs), and is shown on a constant currency basis (abbreviated to 'ccy').\n\n| \u20ac million                                       | Note   | 2023  Reported   | ccy  adjustment   | 2023 ccy   | 2022 1   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------|----------|\n| Total expenditure on operations 1               | a      | 25,946           | 408               | 26,354     | 21,788   |\n| Add: exceptional items in operating expenditure | a      | -                |                   | -          | (31)     |\n| Less: fuel, oil costs and emission charges      | a      | 7,557            | 6                 | 7,563      | 6,120    |\n| Non-fuel costs 1                                |        | 18,389           | 402               | 18,791     | 15,699   |\n| Less: Non-flight specific costs 1               |        | 2,141            | 68                | 2,209      | 1,716    |\n| Airline non-fuel costs                          |        | 16,248           | 334               | 16,582     | 13,983   |\n| ASKs (millions)                                 |        | 323,111          |                   | 323,111    | 263,592  |\n| Airline non-fuel unit costs per ASK (\u20ac cents)   |        | 5.03             |                   | 5.13       | 5.30     |\n\n## e Free cash flow (KPI)\n\nFree cash flow represents the cash generated by the businesses and is defined as the net cash flows from operating activities taken from the Cash flow statement, less the cash flows associated with the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets reported in net cash flows from investing activities from the Cash flow statement.

This measure is used to monitor the Group's leverage and to assess financial headroom against internal and external security analyst and investor benchmarks.\n\nNet debt is defined as long-term borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits. Net debt excludes supply chain financing arrangements which are classified within trade payables (note 23).\n\nEBITDA before exceptional items is defined as operating result before exceptional items, interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment.",

The IAG Board and Management Committee review the results, including revenue and operating costs at constant rates of exchange. These financial measures are calculated at constant rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year's results of the Group. Although the Board and Management Committee do not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Board and Management Committee do believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Group's operating performance on a constant currency basis.

These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. By their nature, they involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements often use words such as 'expects', 'believes', 'may', 'will', 'could', 'should', 'continues', 'intends', 'plans', 'targets', 'predicts', 'estimates', 'envisages' or 'anticipates' or other words of similar meaning or their negatives. They include, without limitation, any and all projections relating to the results of operations and financial conditions of International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. and its subsidiary undertakings from time to time (the 'Group'), as well as plans and objectives for future operations, expected future revenues, financing plans, expected expenditure, acquisitions and divestments relating to the Group and discussions of the Group's business plans, and its assumptions, expectations, objectives and resilience with respect to climate scenarios. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information known to the Group on the date of this report and speak as of the date of this report. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Group does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nActual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report as a result of any number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, economic and geo-political, market, regulatory, climate, supply chain or other significant external events, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Group, and it is not reasonably possible to itemise each item. Accordingly, readers of this report are cautioned against relying on forward-looking statements. Further information on the primary risks of the business and the Group's risk management process is set out in the Risk management and principal risk factors section in this report. All forward-looking statements made on or after the date of this report and attributable to IAG are expressly qualified in their entirety by the primary risks set out in that section.",
