The presentation of these key metrics is not intended to be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS Standards.

The objectives assume that existing EEV and Free Surplus methodology at December 2022 will be applicable over the period.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## Chair's statement\n\n## Focusing on our new purpose\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\n2023 marked our 100 th year operating in Asia and 175 years since Prudential was founded. It was a year in which we put in place the management and strategy to deliver on the additional value that can be realised by an exclusively Asia and Africa focused platform created from two demergers. It was also a year which saw critical developments in our external operating environment, including the return of more normal economic and social conditions in our markets. I would like to thank all our people for the commitment with which they have continued to serve our customers, contributed to a strong operating performance, and put in place the key components for our future growth and success.\n\n## New leadership, renewed purpose and a refreshed strategy\n\nAnil Wadhwani joined as Chief Executive at the end of February 2023, bringing dynamism, energy and a clear focus on a refined strategy and excellence in execution. The Board is delighted with how Anil has begun his tenure, establishing a strong working relationship with the Board through his openness and engagement, inspiring our people and building the management team, including with the appointment of Ben Bulmer as Chief Financial Officer in May. The Board worked with Anil and the leadership team throughout the year on a refreshed strategy and renewed purpose and values. We will continue to support him developing the organisational structure and deepening our capabilities to deliver on the promise of our corporate transformation in recent years.\n\nThe strategy sets out where and how we will create value for our shareholders by enhancing delivery for our customers, strengthening our multi-channel distribution, and transforming our health business model across our chosen markets in Asia and Africa. Key enablers for these strategic pillars include investment in technology, people, and wealth and investment capabilities.\n\nOur renewed purpose - 'For Every Life, For Every Future' - embodies our commitment as a life and health insurance provider and longterm investor in the under-penetrated markets of Asia and Africa. This purpose, and the values that underpin it, were co-created through engagement with colleagues at all levels of the organisation and across our markets. This engagement will continue through 2024 as we embed our values, invest further in skills and talent development, and ensure we are supporting well-being and inclusion throughout the organisation.\n\n## Business momentum\n\nWhile investing in our long-term, sustainable growth, we delivered a strong operational performance in 2023, with most markets gradually recovering to pre-pandemic levels. We responded swiftly and effectively to meet the renewed demand from the resurgence of Chinese Mainland visitors to Hong Kong after the border reopened. We remain committed to market and channel diversification as shown by the growth of APE sales across most of our markets throughout the year. However, our strong operating results were set in a complex landscape of slowing global growth, inflationary pressures and volatile geopolitical events. In particular, the uneven\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntrajectory of China's macro-economic environment as it emerged from the pandemic, coupled with broader geo-political tensions, significantly influenced market sentiment.\n\nThe Board recognises that our business momentum has not been reflected in the company's share price. While this is very disappointing, we are focused on delivering consistently strong business performance built on the execution of a strategy designed to harness the long-term and sustainable growth opportunities we firmly believe are present in Asian and emerging markets. Reflecting our commitment to growing long-term shareholder value, the Board worked with Anil and the leadership team to set out new targets for new business profit and operating free surplus aligned to the strategy. Further detail can be found in the Strategic Report.\n\nOur performance and future growth is underpinned by a strong balance sheet supported by clear and disciplined capital allocation and managing our in-force portfolio to invest in growth opportunities and in our core capabilities, people and technology. We have set out our priorities alongside the strategy, and we have maintained our dividend policy. At the time we announced our strategy update, given our confidence in the strategy, we said we would look through the investments in new business and capabilities when determining the dividend. The Board has approved a second interim dividend for the year of 14.21 cents per share (2022: 13.04 cents per share). When this is combined with the first interim dividend the total dividend for the year is 20.47 cents per share (2022: 18.78 cents per share). We continue to expect the 2024 annual dividend to grow in the range 7 9 per cent. Further detail on our approach to capital allocation is set out on page 42.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability at our core\n\nA clear driver of value for both our business and the societies in which we operate is our commitment to sustainability. We have purposefully aligned our new strategy with wider objectives in each of our markets and we are focused on trying to make a real difference: to deepen and widen financial inclusion, to support health prevention and protection, to invest in the economies, people and communities in which we operate, and to conduct our business in a sustainable and responsible way.\n\nWe recognise that Asia and Africa are regions which have historically contributed the least to the stock of carbon in the environment, where the impact of climate change is felt most, where the need to reduce emissions is now greatest, but the resources available often more scarce. The existing energy mix and future requirements mean investment and engagement is needed to support a genuine brownto-green transition without sacrificing economic and social development. These factors drive our fundamental belief that supporting a just and inclusive transition is the right thing to do in our markets.\n\nIt is important for Prudential to play its part meeting the challenges faced, including through advocacy and engagement with stakeholders, built on the perspectives and experiences of the specific needs and situations of the markets in which we operate and the communities we serve. As steps on a pathway to net zero as an asset owner and manager by 2050, in March 2023 we published our first Climate Transition Plan and in August 2023 we set a new decarbonisation target to reduce the carbon intensity of our investment portfolio (WACI) by 55 per cent by 2030. To underpin this target, we have also developed a new internal investment target on financing the transition to a lower carbon future and embedded sustainability targets in our executive remuneration. More details on our actions and further detailed progress our climate and sustainability targets are set out in our sustainability report on page 97 and in our remuneration report on page 200.\n\n## The Board\n\nThe Board has continued to evolve to best serve an operating company focused on the growth markets of Asia and Africa. David Law, who joined the Board in September 2015, reaches the end of his nine-year tenure this year and will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2024. The Board is immensely grateful to David for his contribution over the last nine years, in particular as Chair of the Audit Committee since May 2017. During this period, in addition to its regular activities, the Audit Committee successfully oversaw the demergers of the M&G and Jackson businesses, an equity raise in Hong Kong, a change of auditors and the adoption of IFRS 17. David has led the Committee with rigour and dedication, and he retires from the Board with our enormous gratitude.\n\nWe are delighted to have such a capable replacement in Jeanette Wong, who has been on the Audit Committee since joining the Board in May 2021. Jeanette will succeed David following the publication of the 2023 full year results and they have been working together closely to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nIn planning for David's retirement, we focused recruiting on future Board members with insurance-specific financial assurance skills. We are therefore pleased to be welcoming Mark Saunders as a Non-executive Director to the Board from 1 April 2024. Mark has extensive knowledge of the insurance industry in Asian markets, working in the industry for 35 years, the last 30 of which in Hong Kong, and is a qualified actuary. He brings a blend of strategic thinking, commercial insight and actuarial skills which\n\nwill be a great asset to the Board and as a member of the Audit and Risk Committees.\n\nThe Board has undergone significant change over the past three years as it has transitioned from a board of a financial holding company of businesses around the world, to the board of an operating company working exclusively in Asia and Africa. As well as composition changes, the Board's agenda, ways of working and culture have adapted to reflect the changed footprint of the company. I was pleased, therefore, with the validation of these efforts from the external Board evaluation that was carried out this year. It reflected on the collaborative atmosphere in the Board, with a culture of transparency and positive and strong relationships between the Board and the senior management team. I welcome the constructive recommendations on how we can further enhance the Board's effectiveness. I am very grateful to all our Board members and the management team for all their contributions.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn 2024, the Board will continue to support Anil and the leadership as they deepen our capabilities and embed rigorous standards of operational delivery and excellence. In a complex external environment, we remain vigilant of how political and geopolitical events and changes are interacting with the global macro-economic environment in ways which compound uncertainty. While we will continue to plan for a challenging environment, we see significant strategic opportunities. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and on delivering the products and services which our customers - current and prospective - need to build their financial resilience and prosperity. Thank you again to all my colleagues in all our markets and functions and Prudential's leadership team for their hard work, dedication, and focus on  delivering a positive performance, and building the platform for Prudential's long-term success.\n\nShriti Vadera\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are the number one independent insurer in Asia bancassurance 5 , and our Asia-based in-house investment arm, Eastspring, has over US$ 237 billion in assets under management and is ranked in the top 10 in six of its markets 6 .\n\nIn 2023, we grew new business profit by 45 per cent to $3,125 million, in excess of the 37 per cent increase in APE sales. Sales growth has continued in the first two months of 2024.\n\nIn August we set out our renewed purpose and strategy for the next five years to 2027, together with the key metrics we will use to measure our success.\n\nOur purpose - For Every Life, For Every Future - defines why we are in this business and what we seek to achieve as custodians of stakeholder value for the long term.\n\nOur strategy sets out our priorities and objectives over the next five years to realise our purpose and how we will create value for all our stakeholders: our customers, our employees, our shareholders and our communities.\n\nThe components of our strategy are:\n\n- - our multi-market growth engines;\n- - our strategic pillars;\n- - our group-wide enablers; and\n- - our organisational model design.\n\nWe believe carrying out the actions to deliver the strategy will transform the business and enable us to take greater advantage of the opportunities open to us.\n\nWe have commenced executing the steps outlined in our updated strategy announced in August. This includes changes in the strategic areas of customer, distribution and health and in our operational model. We have complemented the existing leadership teams with key hires. 2024 will be a pivotal year as we deepen our execution capabilities in the areas most important to us.\n\nWe are seeing early signs of progress across our strategic pillars;\n\n- - in customer, four business units 9 in 2023 are ranked in the top quartile for customer relationship Net Promoter Score (NPS), compared to three in 2022, out of the ten business units 9 that have a standardised approach for measuring customer advocacy. Four further business units 9 improved their rankings by at least a quartile;\n- - in agency distribution, we grew average new business profit per active agent by 59 per cent contributing to a 75 per cent increase in Agency new business profit;\n- - in bancassurance, we continued to expand our bancassurance partner network and increased the proportion of APE sales from health and protection business in this channel from 6 per cent in 2022 to over 7 per cent in 2023; and\n- - in health, new business profit grew 20 per cent to $330 million.\n\nFurther detail on our initial progress on the key strategic pillars and enablers is set out later in this report.\n\nTo demonstrate our commitment to delivering shareholder value through the new strategy, we introduced two new financial objectives 7 :\n\n- - to grow new business profit to 2027 at a rate of 15-20 per cent compound annual growth from the level achieved in 2022; and\n- - for the same period to deliver double digit compound annual growth in operating free surplus generated from in-force insurance and asset management business.\n\nAlongside our early successes in delivering against our strategy we have seen a strong financial performance in 2023 as discussed below.\n\nAs in previous years, we discuss our performance in this report on a constant currency basis 8 , unless stated otherwise. We discuss our financial position on an actual exchange rates basis, unless otherwise noted. The definitions of the key metrics we use to discuss our performance are set out in the \"Definition of performance metrics\" section later in this document.",

The gradual compounding of the new business contribution and improving operating variances will support progress towards our 2027 financial objective.\n\nOur performance reflects the breadth and broad based nature of our markets, with new business profit growing in 17 of our 22 life markets and an increased market share in seven of our Asian life markets 4 .\n\nOur agency channel delivered new business profit of $2,096 million, an increase of 75 per cent. This reflects both APE sales growth of 67 per cent and favourable business mix effects along with a 37 per cent increase in new business profit from health and protection products. Agency sales accounted for 48 per cent of total APE sales and circa two-thirds of the Group's new business profits.\n\nBancassurance new business profit fell 8 per cent to $793 million in 2023 primarily due to challenging market conditions in the Chinese Mainland and Vietnam. Excluding these two markets, new business profit increased by 23 per cent with 11 markets delivering doubledigit growth. APE sales through the bancassurance channel increased 3 per cent compared with 2022, supported by growth in Hong Kong and Taiwan, offset by significant reductions in sales volumes in the Chinese Mainland and Vietnam.\n\nHong Kong was a significant contributor to growth accounting for 45 per cent of new business profits in the period as both its new business profit and APE sales grew by over three times the prior year level. This growth was diversified across distribution channels and products. We see an opportunity for sustained growth in Hong Kong as the drivers of demand from domestic and Chinese Mainland visitors remain intact.\n\nEastspring's funds under management and advice increased by 7 per cent (on an actual exchange rates basis) to $237.1 billion, reflecting positive market movements and inflows from external clients and our life business. These positive movements were offset by expected outflows of funds managed on behalf of M&G plc.\n\nDuring 2023 the Group adopted IFRS 17, a new accounting standard for insurance that significantly altered the Group's IFRS reporting. More details on the change and its impact are set out in the Financial Review. On the IFRS 17 metric, Group adjusted IFRS operating profit for the year was $2,893 million, 8 per cent higher than 2022 calculated on a consistent basis and using constant exchange rates. IFRS profit after tax for 2023 was $1,712 million (2022: loss after tax of $(1,005) million on a constant exchange rate basis, loss after tax of $(997) million on an actual exchange rate basis).\n\nThe substantial increase in new business reported above led to materially higher investment in new business of $(733) million (2022: $(552) million). This resulted in lower group operating free surplus, despite reduced central costs including interest expense and restructuring costs. The Group's capital position remains strong, with an estimated shareholder surplus above the Group's Prescribed Capital Requirement of $16.1 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $15.6 billion on an actual exchange rate basis) and a cover ratio of 295 per cent (31 December 2022: 302 per cent after allowing for the debt redemption in January 2023).\n\nReflecting the Group's strong capital position and in line with its policy the Directors have approved a second interim dividend per share of 14.21 cents per share (2022: 13.04 cent per share), for a total 2023 divided of 20.47 cents per share (2022: 18.78 cents per share), an increase of 9 per cent over the prior year.\n\n## Focus on our three strategic pillars\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Enhancing customer experiences - we are committed\n\nto putting customer advocacy at the heart of our business and becoming their trusted partner. We have the following priorities:\n\n- - to support customer acquisition by personalised targeting -allowing us to more easily identify engagement opportunities;\n- - to curate comprehensive customer-led differentiated proposition offerings with segmentation by life stages; and\n- - to offer seamless end-to-end customer experiences through simple tech-enabled journeys combining technology with human care and understanding.\n\nBy focusing on these priorities we believe we will drive new customer acquisition and existing customer retention.\n\nWe have standardised our approach to measuring and analysing customer advocacy across ten business units 9 . Our approach is centred around net promoter scores, which measure how likely customers are to recommend Prudential. We have seen initial traction in 2023 with four of our business units 9 in the top quartile (up from three in 2022). Eight out of ten business units 9 moved up at least one quartile or remained in 1st quartile in the latest relationship net promoter scores results. The improvement seen has been led by leadership initiatives that prioritise the voice of customers in our business. These include the launch of a monthly CEO customer experience forum in our markets, together with a proactive approach to following up with customers who report unsatisfactory experiences. We empowered employees to listen to the voices of our customers through the introduction of service huddles. These meetings bring together employees across a range of functions to discuss recent customer feedback and collectively identify solutions for customer pain points. We will continue this journey in 2024 and beyond with more customer advocacy initiatives and actions.",

        "page_content": "Strategic and operating review continued\n\nTo achieve our ambition of having ten business units 9 in the top quartile relationship NPS in their respective markets by 2027, we will further strengthen our efforts around customer advocacy. We will do this by investing in common platforms and frameworks, institutionalising best practices, deploying digital and data capabilities in customer acquisition, servicing and engagement. We will deliver these capabilities at pace and scale across all markets with a unified customer organisation structure, which will give us a strong foundation to support the achievement of our ambitions. We plan to drive customer advocacy by; setting high service standards, continuously listening to customer feedback and acting on it, redesigning our customer journey and using robust portfolio management to engage new customers, increase repeated sales and improve loyalty.\n\nWe measure our success using relationship net promoter scores across the organisation. We aim to be top quartile for ten business units 9 by 2027. For our customer retention rate we have an ambition of achieving between 90 per cent and 95 per cent by 2027. During 2023 we saw a slight decline in the customer retention rate to 86 per cent (2022: 89 per cent) which was affected by an industry-wide fall in consumer sentiment in Vietnam. We see customer base growth and improving net promoter scores for each transactional touchpoint as the building blocks of our overall relationship net promoter score.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver four million leads were generated and distributed to the agency force using PruLeads, our digital leads platform in PruForce, across our markets in 2023. Assisted by this technology, our agents converted 8 per cent of these leads into new sales to meet customers' needs and financial goals.\n\nWe are upskilling the next generation of highly productive agents via our on-demand learning and development platform, which offers personalised curriculums to assist agents in engaging, nurturing and converting prospects. Agency leaders are being trained to become the next generation of professional team-builders through structured leadership development programmes.\n\n## Bancassurance\n\nBancassurance provides incremental access to large numbers of customers in multiple locations using third-party infrastructure. It is a significant source of new business for the Group. Our 200 bank partners include 10 key strategic partners, including two joint venture and associate partners.\n\nThe penetration rate in our seven strategic bank partners (excluding our joint venture and associate partners and our partner in Cambodia and Laos) in the year was 7.8 per cent (2022: circa 7.6 per cent).\n\nWe are building on the performance seen in 2023 by delivering against our strategic priorities.\n\nWe are broadening our customer proposition to offer attractive health and protection propositions and by penetrating the high net worth and premium segments. Overall, we sold around 1 million new policies in 2023, with regular premium policies contributing to more than 90 per cent of APE sales. APE sales of health and protection products through bancassurance partners increased 26 per cent in the year, representing over half of the policies sold through the channel and over 7 per cent of total APE sales in 2023 (2022: 6 per cent). We see increasing the contribution of health and protection products to our bancassurance channel as a key step in achieving our bancassurance new business profit growth ambition.\n\nWe are developing omni-channel customer journeys backed by analytics to engage with our customers . For example in Thailand, we innovated with a new simple in-branch digital referral model with a key strategic partner, which enables us to reach potentially over 7,000 customers and will help them achieve their medium term saving and protection goals.\n\nTo expand bank penetration further, we will deploy integrated dataled marketing to target customers more effectively. In early 2024 we launched a structured customer engagement program with UOB, powered by analytics. The programme supports sales staff in recommending suitable insurance offerings during their interactions with customers.\n\nWe reward our bank partners for outcomes that deliver for the customer and create value . We have introduced new reward mechanisms with our strategic partners to deliver win-win solutions for customers, partners and shareholders.\n\nWe also aim to offer our bank partners' staff learning and development via integrated modern and digital learning platforms that can provide modular, on-demand, training.\n\nWe continue to expand our bancassurance network. In Thailand, our new 10-year partnership with CIMB became effective at the end of 2023. In the first two months of partnership, its APE sales had already accounted for 6 per cent of Thailand bancassurance APE sales.\n\nIn Vietnam, we extended our partnership with VIB until 2036. Our agreement with VIB incorporates a first-in-market approach to\n\n## 2. Technology-powered distribution\n\n- e\n\nmpowering our\n\nagency force with best-in-class technologies and solutions, deepening our bank partner base through segmented propositions and creating omnichannel customer journeys will enable us to reach more customers and strengthen relationships with existing ones.\n\n## Agency\n\nWe have around 68,000 average monthly active agents and, over 9,000 who qualify for Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) status. Prudential has one of the leading agency forces in Asia.\n\nWe have the ambition to increase agency new business profit by 2.5 to 3 times from the 2022 level by 2027, through significantly increasing the number of active monthly agents and more than doubling new business profit per agent over the same period.\n\nIn 2023, the number of average active agents per month increased by three per cent and average monthly new business profit per active agent increased by 59 per cent to over $2,800.\n\nWe continue to focus on quality recruitment through tailored and strategic talent sourcing . Our signature career switcher programme for existing professionals is active in seven markets and recruited over 4,500 advisors. On average these advisors were six times more productive in their first year than other typical agent recruits. In Hong Kong, we introduced a Top Talent Professional recruitment programme tapping into over 100 high profile talent immigrants sponsored by government. In Singapore, we inaugurated Prudential Financial Advisers to attract professional financial planners who are committed to offering holistic advice on both insurance and investment solutions.\n\nWe continue to upskill our agency force by enhancing the career path and learning journey for our agents. This equips them with the necessary knowledge, skills and tools to be a trusted advisor to our customers. We integrated our activity and leads management engine with customer campaigns to scale up and enhance the productivity of our agents. 115,000 agents used PruForce, our technology-driven distribution platform, which we believe enhances agent effectiveness.",

Transforming the health business model - we\n\nbelieve there are substantial opportunities to further grow our health business by becoming a trusted partner to our customers and playing a much-needed coordinating role across their healthcare journeys. We are focusing on the following priorities:\n\n- -Upgrading our core health insurance proposition - we are accelerating development of more advanced, segment-specific and sustainable products. This includes incorporating risk-based pricing and value-added services, such as enhancing the in-network benefits of existing as-charged products to cater to our customers' evolving healthcare needs. We are also adopting practices that are utilised elsewhere in the Group to assist with managing customer affordability and continuity of coverage - for example, in Indonesia and Malaysia, we are introducing regular repricing of health products. In addition, we are supporting our agents' efforts to distribute health products through enhanced recognition, reward and training initiatives. We are also strengthening our health branding campaigns to highlight Prudential's aim to become a trusted partner for its health customers. Operational excellence is being further enhanced by straight-through-processing and AIenabled digitalisation of underwriting and claims journeys. We believe increased automation and enhanced analytics will deliver better customer experience as well as further protect us against claims fraud and abuse, for example, by implementing AI-driven detection models.\n- -Expanding our role through connecting health-care journeys using an asset-light approach - we will implement guided care pathways and case management to help customers better navigate through their healthcare journey. By leveraging our streamlined preferred medical provider partners, we will ensure high-quality and cost-effective care. Examples include scoring and tiering of network hospitals based on outcome and cost in Indonesia and Malaysia, regional arrangements for breast cancer treatment in Thailand by a leading hospital group, and developing case management and concierge capabilities in Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nWe have developed an operational plan across our major health markets of Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Singapore with clear accountabilities, performance metrics, timelines and deliverables. In early 2024, we appointed Arjan Toor as Health CEO, who will be based in Singapore and has joined us from Cigna. We are allocating dedicated resources and will be recruiting further key talent at both local and Group levels to manage health insurance as a line of business in order to drive business performance and accelerate growth. We are exploring health opportunities in India.\n\nIn 2023, our health business across the Group contributed $330 million to new business profit, an increase of 20 per cent. By focusing on the priorities above we are committed to achieving our ambitions to deliver a top-quartile health insurance Net Promoter Score by 2027, growing our customer base and profitability, and doubling our health new business profit from 2022 to 2027.\n\n## Focus on our three strategic enablers\n\nTo capture the growth opportunities that we have identified in each of the strategic pillars above, we have three enablers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enabler#1: Open-architecture technology platform\n\nOur long-term programme is changing our technology operating model. By delivering superior customer and distribution experiences, our new model will support our three strategic pillars Customer, Distribution and Health. Data privacy and customer information security are critical focus areas for this function and we are investing substantial amounts in infrastructure, systems and culture to support this.\n\nIn respect of our wholly owned operations technology driven core competencies that are consistent across these markets will be housed on an open architecture platform . Our strategy focuses on i.) creating new, common capabilities with greater collaboration between central centres of excellence and local market teams; ii.) improving resiliency; iii.) efficiency; and iv) using AI and data analytics throughout our whole organisation.\n\nWe intend to move our applications in different markets to a common platform, to help provide a uniform user experience, improve our efficiency, increase operational reliability and create new global capabilities as we switch to modular and standardised applications. We aim to cut the number of our applications by more than half by 2027. We have begun this journey with the introduction of our PruServices 2.0 Web in Malaysia in January 2024. PruServices 2.0 Web offers an improved and simplified customer experience with immediate customer feedback and as we roll it out across our markets, we will be able to retire 15 customer service applications. Similarly, PruForce, the technology-driven distribution platform for our agents, will offer a consistent set of features for our agents across our markets, enabling us to retire 26 agency-related applications.\n\nImproving the reliability of our technology infrastructure is key. We have added a service integration and management layer to oversee our outsourced technology infrastructure and operations services. This is to ensure the performance and dependability of our systems. We also invested in tooling capabilities to improve the efficiency of infrastructure monitoring, spot high risk or vulnerable areas that need more support and upgrades, to enhance our overall system availability. As a result, we lowered the number of monthly incidents by 60 per cent, and improved recovery times by 40 per cent in 2023.\n\nWe have also finalised our technology organisation operating model, which brings together our technology talent pool across the business into a single integrated team. This new operating model will leverage the experience and skills of our talent pool in specific markets for the benefit of the whole business. It also captures efficiencies by removing duplication of functions and skills. As part of the new operating model, we are also building teams centred around global technology products for our customer and agency pillars. We plan to deploy similar teams for other business areas and group functions by the end of 2024.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nStrategic and operating review continued\n\nIn addition, we have developed advanced platforms that store the key data of our operations in our main markets. This enables us to deploy advanced analytics and AI for high value purposes. For example, using GenAI to help our call centre agents shorten customer enquiry times. In a test run in one market, product enquiry times were cut from more than four minutes to less than 30 seconds. We are now testing this on real-time customer enquiries as well as in two other markets. We are also working on utilising analytics and AI more across our strategic pillars and those group functions that use the open architecture platform. We continue to invest in our machine learning operations capabilities to build AI and machine learning models of scale. Our aim is to embed analytics and AI within the culture of our organisation. In line with this, we are looking to design and develop tailored training for all our employees across all levels, locations and functions, along with adoption programmes to help our employees make use of analytics and AI in their daily work life. To facilitate these programmes, we are setting up an AI lab to foster innovation and creativity internally, while also attracting external talent and ideas. The lab will help us try out new capabilities that we can then grow and use at scale across the organisation. Through these initiatives, we plan to deliver at least two high-value analytics and AI use cases per strategic pillar this year for use in our markets.\n\nInnovation in AI is also being undertaken at our Joint Ventures. For example, by utilising AI technology, CPL has shortened the underwriting of non-standard cases from three days to one and a half hours. Meanwhile, the claims payment turnaround has shortened from 1.29 days in 2022 to 0.45 days in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enabler#2: Engaged people and highperformance culture\n\nAn engaged workforce is critical to the delivery of our strategy and we are working with our people to create a culture that is customer led and performance-driven.\n\nWe aim to create an environment that allows our people to thrive, connect, grow, and succeed. We will focus on the following priorities to deliver this:\n\n- - Promote values-based leadership and aligned reward structure to help build a culture that is customer-led and performance-driven;\n- - Build strategic capabilities through targeted talent acquisition and internal talent development, particularly within the areas of customer, distribution, health and technology;\n- - Develop a robust internal talent pipeline through succession planning, facilitating mobility and focused development plans, in tandem with efforts to accelerate development of female leaders; and\n- - Standardise, simplify, and digitalise end-to-end people processes to enhance the employee experience.\n\nBy focusing on these priorities, we aim to create a better workplace experience as we make the required shifts across the organisation to achieve our strategy.\n\nThe PruWay (our values) was co-created with our employees and launched in September 2023 following the launch of our Strategy and Purpose. Progress has been made in activating the PruWay and engaging the organisation on our values and desired behaviours. By engaging with the Group's senior leaders in a series of workshops and with the wider workforce through the Group Executive Committee (GEC), we have started the process of internalising and translating a set of value statements into day-to-day actions. We call these PruSteps. The Group's senior leaders will be involved in embedding the PruWay deeper into the organisation through workshops that will touch all employees in 2024.\n\nTo drive a high-performance culture, a refreshed performance and pay model will be implemented in 2024. The emphasis will be to align personal and team goals to our strategy and the PruWay. This is to ensure we establish an environment where highly engaged employees consistently demonstrate behaviour and practice our values. To do this, we will communicate the value proposition on what a high-performance culture means and build our capability to uplift the strength of our workforce through meaningful and effective development conversations.\n\nTo build a robust talent pipeline we are in the process of implementing a consistent succession planning and talent development process to enhance the robustness and sustainability of our leadership bench strength.\n\nThrough these measures we seek to improve the engagement of all our employees with an ambition to have top-quartile employee engagement by 2027.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enabler#3: Wealth and investments capabilities\n\nWealth and Investment is a key enabler to help us deliver on our purpose.\n\nWe plan to enhance our wealth and investment capabilities by leveraging Eastspring and our investment office as well as providing distribution support to our top agents to better serve our wealth customers.\n\nWe are committed to product innovation to enable us to offer a wide variety of customised wealth solutions that meet our customers' needs for wealth appreciation, wealth protection, wealth succession and retirement, and to provide our distribution teams with the tools and training they need to serve our wealth customers better.\n\nThe cornerstone of helping customers meet their financial goals is the delivery of positive investment performance and the creation of appropriate delivery mechanisms to achieve this. Consideration of asset allocations, mandates and selection of investment managers for Prudential insurance policies sits with the life companies, overseen by the Group Investment Officer. Eastspring's specific investment skills and track record in certain asset classes along with its investment wrapper design capabilities are being harnessed alongside third-party capabilities.",

These may include a combination of passive and active investment strategies. The packaging of these strategies into discretionary fund management options provides the client with the potential to invest in a spectrum of asset management styles over their lifetimes and as their financial circumstances change.\n\nEastspring has focused on developing its human resources both in terms of human capital and internal performance benchmarking. A CIO has been appointed in February 2024, who will be responsible for the day to day management of the investment teams. A new head of distribution was also appointed in February 2024.\n\nEastspring is supporting the training and development needs of our Prudential Financial Advisers (PFA) distribution force, a force of over 500 financial advisors who offer a more holistic suite of products outside of our core Prudential insurance offerings. Already, products from seven general insurance and two life firms are included in the range, broadening the suite of products for legacy planning for highnet-worth individuals and retirement plans to meet the needs of a rapidly ageing population. The range is expected to expand further in 2024 and a thousand additional advisors are planned to be added to PFA in due course.\n\nWe continue to strengthen our wealth team and are enhancing our go-to-market investment updates for customers and distribution teams. We see opportunities to better meet our customers needs for wealth accumulation, wealth protection, wealth succession and retirement. Through high-performance investment teams we will seek to drive continual improvement in customer outcomes across the wealth life-cycle.\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Source: Kantar survey.\n- (2) Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, World Population Prospects 2022.\n\n(3)\n\nSource: Swiss Re forecast (July 2023).\n\n## Implementing our Organisational Model\n\nChanges to our organisational model are being made to enable us to deliver consistent performance across the Group and to prioritise value creation when deploying capital across our markets.\n\nThese changes include the complementing of existing teams and structures with additional skills and capabilities through the sourcing of selected new talent, reskilling existing talent and changing reporting and responsibilities across teams.\n\nWe believe our new organisational model, together with our commitment to invest in building out our capabilities further, will harness economies of scale and generate value for all our stakeholders.\n\nBy implementing changes to our organisational model and by combining the technology platform changes we are making, including the roll-out of best practices across our markets, we are confident we can deliver a consistently high level of service to our customers and our partners over the long term.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe delivered an excellent financial and operational performance in 2023 and deployed increased levels of capital in new business, enhancing core capabilities and expanding distribution. Sales growth has continued in the first two months of 2024. Given the relentless execution focus in implementing our strategy, we are increasingly confident in achieving our 2027 financial and strategic objectives and in accelerating value creation for our shareholders.",

The roll-out of key priorities, such as personalised targeting, segmentation by life stage, differentiated propositions and simple techenabled journeys underpin our customer-centric strategy.\n\n## Markets\n\nThe Asian and African markets we are focused on are large - with increasing demand for health protection and wealth management solutions.\n\nWe are one of the few pure-play Asian/African focused groups in our sector. We hold top-three positions in 10 out of the 14 Asian life markets and top five in 6 out of the 8 African life markets we have a presence in. We have one of the largest agency forces in Asia and we are the number one independent insurer in Asia bancassurance. The breadth of our access to the world's fastest-growing markets across Asia and Africa is therefore a key differentiator for us.\n\n## Products\n\nAs well as our traditional protection and wealth products, we are addressing the major health insurance opportunity in Asia.\n\nWe have had a substantial health and protection business in several markets for many years. There are opportunities to grow the Group's footprint across other markets and we want to become a trusted partner to our customers, fulfilling a much-needed coordinating role across their healthcare journeys.\n\n## Distribution\n\nPrudential has a multi-channel distribution platform of scale.\n\nWe have scale in both agency and bancassurance channels with around 68,000 average monthly active agents and more than 200 bank partners, 10 of which are strategic.\n\nAggregate household wealth in Asia totalled over $150 trillion 2 in 2021 and is expected to continue to grow in the years ahead.\n\nEastspring, our in-house asset manager, spans 11 markets and manages over US$237 billion of assets and occupies top-10 positions in six of its markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe offer insurance and asset management products, focusing on the markets where we believe there is rising demand for savings and protection offerings. By tailoring our products to the needs of customers in these markets, we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth and value creation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing our purpose\n\n> p.12\n\n<!-- image -->",

For asset management, it equates to post-tax adjusted operating profit for the year.

This enables the Group to manage a degree of short-term market volatility. Therefore, adjusted operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is management's preferred measure when evaluating the performance of the business. Other distorting items are excluded from adjusted operating profit to allow more relevant period-on-period comparisons of the trading operations of the Group (eg the effects of corporate transactions are excluded). A full reconciliation is given in note B1.1 to the IFRS financial results\n\nThe Group's adjusted operating profit was $2,893 million, up 8 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis (6 per cent on an actual exchange rate basis), largely as a result of lower central costs and higher profits from Eastspring, our asset management business. The Group's total IFRS profit after tax was $1,712 million, an improvement on the 2022 loss after tax of $(1,005) million on constant exchange rate basis ($(997) million on an actual exchange rate basis) given significant investment losses in the prior year following rising interest rates.\n\nManagement use adjusted shareholders' equity to provide a useful reconciliation between IFRS 17 shareholders' equity and the Group's embedded value framework, which is often used for valuations. It is calculated by adding the IFRS 17 expected future profit (as contained within the contractual service margin) to IFRS shareholders' equity for all entities in the Group. A full reconciliation is given in note II(ii) of the additional information.\n\nThe adjusted shareholders' equity increased to $37.3 billion (2022: $35.2 billion on an actual exchange rate basis) driven by an increase in IFRS shareholders' equity (up 7 per cent) and an increase in the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) (up 5 per cent).\n\n## Notes\n\n- (3) IFRS Comparatives for 2022 have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 17.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nFinancial statements\n\n## Financial review\n\n## Strong and diversified financial performance\n\nPrudential delivered a strong 2023 financial performance. This highlights the value of our diversification across geography and by distribution channel. We introduced two new financial objectives as an integral part of the Group's strategy update. In 2023 we made good progress towards our 2027 new business profit objective and are on track with our related 2027 objective for operating free surplus generated from in-force insurance and asset management business. 2023 also saw higher EEV operating profit and shareholders' equity, as well as higher Group adjusted operating profit following CSM growth.\n\n2023 saw an improvement in economic performance of the countries in which we operate. There was still volatility although this reduced over the course of the year. Government bond yields in many of our Asian markets reduced while the US 10-year yield closed the year relatively stable at 3.9 per cent. Equity market performance varied considerably, with the S&P 500 index increasing by 24 per cent, the MSCI Asia excluding Japan equity index by 4 per cent, while the Hang Seng index fell by 14 per cent.\n\nAs in previous years, we comment on our performance in local currency terms (expressed on a constant exchange rate basis) to show the underlying business trends in periods of currency movement, unless otherwise noted. We discuss our financial position on an actual exchange rates basis, unless otherwise noted. The definitions of the key metrics we use to discuss our performance in this report are set out in the 'Definition of performance metrics' section later in this document.\n\nNew business profit was up 45 per cent to $3,125 million, led by Hong Kong, with a double-digit growth in 12 of our 22 markets following the removal of all pandemic-related restrictions, in particular the reopening of the border between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland and consequential rebound of APE sales. Further, we saw a 34 per cent increase in the new business profit for health and protection products contributing to 40 per cent of our new business profit, while the new business profit for savings product grew by 54 per cent. This was underpinned by a 37 per cent growth in APE sales, which, in absolute terms, exceeded the pre-pandemic level of 2019. Excluding the effects of interest rates and other economic changes, given our active EEV reporting basis, new business profit increased by 47 per cent.\n\nGroup EEV operating profit increased by 17 per cent to $4,546 million, largely due to higher new business profits from insurance business, an increase in the profit from Eastspring, our asset management business, and a reduction in central costs. The operating return on embedded value was 10 per cent compared with 9 per cent in 2022. After allowing for the payment of the external dividend and economic effects, such as changes in interest rates, and currency movements, the Group's embedded value at 31 December 2023 was $45.3 billion (31 December 2022: $42.2 billion on an actual exchange rate basis), equivalent to 1,643 cents per share (31 December 2022: 1,534 cents per share on an actual exchange rate basis). The operating free surplus generated from in-force insurance and asset management business during the period was $2,740 million, broadly flat when compared to prior year. Investment in new business of $(733) million (2022: $(552) million) reflected higher APE sales and business mix effects. As a result total operating free surplus generated from life and asset management business reduced to $2,007 million (2022: $2,173 million).\n\nThe Group implemented IFRS 17, the new accounting standard for insurance contracts in 2023 with comparatives restated accordingly. In line with the preliminary guidance provided with the Group's 2022 results (on an actual exchange rates basis), the Group shareholders' equity at 1 January 2022, the date of transition, increased by $1.8 billion to $18.9 billion and 2022 full year adjusted operating profit fell by $653 million to $2,722 million. The full year 2022 saw a loss after tax of $(997) million on an IFRS 17 basis. While IFRS 17 is an important accounting change, resulting in changes to the timing of profit recognition compared with the previous IFRS 4 approach, it does not change the total level of profit generated. As a result, it does not change the underlying economics of our business. Our embedded value framework, which is linked to the Group's regulatory position and consequently future capital generation, is in our view more representative of shareholder value. The Group also implemented IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2023, with no material impact on the Group's financial statements. Further details on the transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are included in the IFRS financial results.",

        "page_content": "Group IFRS adjusted operating profit was $2,893 million, up 8 per cent in 2023, largely as a result of lower central costs and higher profits from Eastspring, our asset management business. The Group's total IFRS profit after tax for the period was $1,712 million, an improvement on the 2022 loss after tax of $(1,005) million on a constant exchange rate basis (loss of $(997) million on an actual exchange rate basis). The swing in result largely reflects changes in short-term fluctuations in interest rates. There was a modest decrease in interest rates in 2023 compared with interest rates increasing significantly in 2022.\n\nAdjusted shareholders' equity increased to $37.3 billion (31 December 2022: $35.2 billion on an actual exchange rate basis), equivalent to 1,356 cents per share (31 December 2022: 1,280 cents per share on an actual exchange rate basis), driven by an increase in IFRS shareholders' equity (up 7 per cent) and an increase in the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) (up 5 per cent). The CSM benefited from the contribution from new business and unwind. Using a longerterm normalised return for Variable Fee Approach (VFA) business, the unwind and new business contribution would have exceeded the release in the period by $1.7 billion, equivalent to a net increase of 9 per cent in the CSM compared with the start of year position.\n\nOur Group's regulatory capital position, free surplus and central liquidity positions remain robust. The Group's leverage remains near the bottom of our target range at 20 per cent, estimated on a Moody's basis.\n\nThe Group capital adequacy requirements are aligned with the established EEV and free surplus framework by comparing the total eligible Group capital resources with the Group's Prescribed Capital Requirement (GPCR). At 31 December 2023, the estimated shareholder surplus above the GPCR was $16.1 billion (31 December 2022: $15.6 billion on an actual exchange rates basis) and cover ratio 295 per cent (31 December 2022: 307 per cent before allowing for the debt redemption in January 2023 and 302 per cent after the redemption).\n\nSupported by a clear and disciplined capital allocation policy, the Group is well positioned, with considerable financial flexibility including leverage capacity, to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead. In 2023, we have allocated capital to investing in higher new business at attractive rates of return, in developing our customer, distribution, health and technology capabilities and we intend to deploy $1billion as part of our updated strategy. In line with our capital allocation priorities (as set out in the Capital Management section below) excess capital, if and when it emerges, would be returned to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's dividend policy is unchanged and described later in this report. Recognising the strong conviction we have in the Group's strategy, when determining the annual dividend we look through the investments in new business and investments in capabilities. The Board has approved a second interim dividend of 14.21cents per share (2022: 13.04 cents per share up 9 per cent). When this is combined with the first interim dividend the Group's total 2023 dividend is 20.47 cents per share (2022: 18.78 cents per share), an increase of 9 per cent. The Board intends to maintain this approach, and continues to expect the 2024 annual dividend to grow in the range 7 - 9 per cent.\n\nThe Group is carrying out a number of actions to support the development of liquidity in the trading of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, following its capital raise in 2021. In 2024, the Group is actively exploring the use of scrip dividends, including issuance only on the Hong Kong line and the dilutive effect being neutralised by a share buy back on the London line.\n\nThe Group executed a $41 million share repurchase programme in January 2024 to neutralise the 2023 Employee and agent share scheme issuance. It intends to make further repurchases in the future to offset the expected dilution from the vesting of awards under employee and agent share schemes.\n\nWe believe that the Group's performance during the year positions us well, as we implement the new strategy, to meet our financial objectives to grow new business profit and consequently in-force insurance and asset management operating free surplus generated, as detailed in the strategic and operating review.",

Adjusted operating profit for insurance business was at similar levels of 2022, with economic movements in 2022 reducing the level of longer-term net investment result (which is based on opening asset values), largely offset by a higher insurance service result.\n\nDetailed discussion of IFRS financial performance by segment, including the detailed analysis of asset management business is presented in the section on 'Performance by market'.",

The adjusted CSM release 1 in FY2023 of $2,205 million (2022: $2,242 million) equates to an annualised release rate of circa 9.5 per cent, broadly similar to the release rate seen in 2022 and broadly consistent with the 2023 release expected as at the end of 2022.\n\nThe release of the risk adjustment of $218 million (2022: $178 million) represents the expiry of non-market risk in the period. As expected, this release is a relatively stable proportion of the opening balance as compared with the corresponding rate in the prior year.\n\nExperience variances of $(118) million (2022: $(62) million) comprise largely of claims and expense variances (those impacting past or current service rather than future service which is reflected in CSM). A small element of the elevated expenses reflects the investment in our strategic pillars consistent with our Strategy.\n\nThe other insurance service result of $(109) million (2022: $(195) million) largely reflects losses on contracts that are described under IFRS 17 as 'onerous', either at inception or because changes in the period result in the CSM being exhausted. It does not mean these contracts are not profitable overall as the CSM does not allow for realworld returns, which are earned over time. The losses in 2022 were largely as a result of adverse economic conditions which have stabilised in 2023.\n\nThe net investment result of $1,241 million (2022: $1,271 million) largely reflects the long-term return on assets backing equity and capital and long-term spreads on business not accounted for under the variable fee approach. The long-term rates are applied to the opening value of assets and so falls in asset values over 2022, following the adverse market movements in 2022 saw this source of income reduce in 2023. Growth in the General Measurement Model asset base from new business in recent periods and renewal premiums offset some of this reduction.\n\nOther income and expenditure of $(122) million (2022: $(100) million) mainly relates to expenses that are not directly related to an insurance contract as defined under IFRS 17.\n\n## Movement in Contractual Service Margin\n\nThe CSM balance represents a discounted stock of unearned profit which will be released over time as services are provided. This balance increases due to additions from profitable new business contracts sold in the period and the unwind of the in-force book. It is also updated for any changes in expected future profitability, where applicable, including the effect of short-term market fluctuations for business measured using variable fee approach. The release of the CSM, which is the main driver of adjusted operating profit, is then calculated after allowing for these movements.\n\nIn a normalised market environment, if the contribution from new business and the unwind of the CSM balance is greater than the rate at which services are provided, then the CSM balance will increase. The new business added to the CSM will therefore be an important factor in building the CSM and we expect the compounding effect from the new business added to the CSM over time to support growth in IFRS 17 adjusted operating profit in the future. The objectives announced in August for EEV new business profit growth will act to support such CSM growth. As we grow new business profit, in line with our recently announced financial objectives, we would expect this to generate growth of the CSM and hence lead to adjusted operating profit growth over time.\n\nThe table below sets out the movement of CSM over the period.",

This increase exceeded the release of the CSM to the income statement in the period of $(2,208) million, demonstrating the strength of our franchise and its ability to deliver future growth in CSM and ultimately adjusted operating profit.\n\nOther movements in the CSM reflect economic and other variances to update the CSM for changes in expected future profitability including the impact of short term market effects of business accounted for under the variable fee approach. In 2023 'economic and other variances' includes $117 million for new riders added to existing base savings contracts. The incremental value from such sales is not included within the new business contribution to CSM because our IFRS17 approach considers insurance contracts as a whole. In contrast, EEV will include this amount as new business. The remainder of the variance includes the effects of the operating variances and assumption changes on future profits and the impact of a  reduction in interest rates and changes in equity indices. Movements in exchange rates had a negative impact of $(61) million on the closing CSM. Overall the CSM grew by 5 per cent, or 9 per cent excluding the effect of economic and other variances and exchange rates.\n\n## Other income and expenditure\n\nCentral costs (before restructuring and IFRS 17 implementation costs) were 19 per cent lower in 2023 as compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of the targeted reduction of head office costs and the redemption of a senior debt instrument in January 2023. Interest payable on core structural borrowings reduced by $28 million in 2023 compared with the prior year. Total head office expenditure was $(230) million (2022: ($277) million). Net investment return and other items improved by $23 million from increased investment returns on Group Treasury following the increase in interest rates.\n\nRestructuring costs of $(201) million (2022: $(293) million) reflect the Group's project to implement and embed IFRS 17, and one-off costs associated with regulatory and other initiatives in our business. IFRS 17 costs are expected to decrease but in 2024 will be replaced by investment to enhance Eastspring's operating model and improve our back office efficiency and scalability. From the end of 2024, restructuring costs are expected to revert over time to the lower levels typically incurred historically.\n\n## IFRS basis non-operating items\n\nNon-operating items in the year consist of negative short-term fluctuations in investment returns of $(774) million (2022: $(3,404) million) and $(22) million of costs associated with corporate transactions (2022: gain of $55 million).\n\nThese short-term fluctuations principally arise from our business in the Chinese Mainland reflecting negative equity returns as well as the impact from lower interest rates on the discount rate for General Measurement Model (GMM) best estimate insurance liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## IFRS effective tax rates\n\nIn 2023, the effective tax rate on adjusted operating profit was 15 per cent (2022: 20 per cent). The decrease from the 2022 effective tax rate primarily reflects the recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation to historical tax losses, due to an increase in forecast taxable profit in the UK tax group, together with a reduction from 2022 to 2023 in head office costs for which no tax credit is recognised.\n\nThe effective tax rate on total IFRS profit in 2023 was 18 per cent (2022: negative 55 per cent), reflecting a reduction in the level of investment losses on which no tax credit is recognised.\n\nDuring 2023, jurisdictions around the world, including some relevant to Prudential, commenced implementation of the OECD global minimum tax rules. For those jurisdictions where the rules will apply to Prudential for the 2024 financial period, management's assessment is that the new tax rules (which involve comparing a jurisdiction's effective tax rate to the global minimum effective tax rate of 15 per cent) are not expected to have a material impact on the IFRS tax charge for 2024. From 2025 onwards, the new tax rules are expected\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\n## Group IFRS shareholders' equity\n\n|                                                                   | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Profit /(loss) for the year                                       | 1,712     | (997)     |\n| Less non-controlling interest                                     | 11        | 10        |\n| Profit (loss) after tax for the year attributable to shareholders | 1,701     | (1,007)   |\n| Exchange movements, net of related tax                            | (124)     | (603)     |\n| External dividends                                                | (533)     | (474)     |\n| Other movements                                                   | 48        | (121)     |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in shareholders' equity                   | 1,092     | (2,205)   |\n| Shareholders' equity at beginning of the year                     |           | -         |\n| As previously reported                                            | 16,731    | 17,088    |\n| Effect of initial application of IFRS 17 & IFRS 9, net of tax     | -         | 1,848     |\n| Shareholders' equity at end of the year                           | 17,823    | 16,731    |\n| Shareholders' value per share 3                                   | 647\u00a2      | 608\u00a2      |\n| Adjusted shareholders equity 3                                    | 37,346    | 35,211    |\n\nGroup IFRS shareholders' equity increased from $16.7 billion at the start of 2023 (after allowing for the effects of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9) to $17.8 billion at 31 December 2023. This largely reflects profit generated during the period, offset by dividend payments of $(0.5) billion, and exchange movements of $(0.1) billion.\n\nIn 2023, the Group completed the disposal of its remaining interest in Jackson, the Group's former US business, for cash of $273 million. This gave rise to a gain of $8 million compared to the carrying value of this interest at 31 December 2022 that is included in other movements. Following the adoption of IFRS 9, the income statement is unaffected by this transaction.\n\nThe IFRS adjusted shareholders' equity represents the sum of Group IFRS shareholders' equity and CSM, net of tax. Group's IFRS adjusted equity increased to $37.3 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $35.2 billion) reflecting increases in IFRS shareholders' equity and the CSM.

Management continues to assess the likely impact on the 2025 and subsequent financial periods and guidance on the potential impact will be provided in due course.\n\n## Total tax contributions\n\nThe Group continues to make significant tax contributions in the jurisdictions in which it operates, with $969 million remitted to tax authorities in 2023, slightly lower than the equivalent amount of $1,009 million remitted in 2022 (on an actual exchange rate basis).\n\n## Tax strategy\n\nThe Group publishes its tax strategy annually which, in addition to complying with the mandatory UK (Finance Act 2016) requirements, also includes a number of additional disclosures which provide insight into the Group's tax contributions. An updated version of the tax strategy, including 2023 data, will be available on the Group's website before 31 May 2024.",

The operating return on average embedded value was 10 per cent (2022: 9 per cent).\n\nThe operating profit from the insurance business increased to $4,904 million, largely reflecting a 45 per cent increase in new business profit to $3,125 million following growth in APE sales, partly offset by a (24) per cent fall in profit from in-force business to $1,779 million. The profit from in-force business is driven by the expected return and the effects of operating assumption changes and experience variances. The expected return was lower at $2,122 million (2022: $2,531 million), reflecting a lower opening balance to which the expected return is applied, as a result of economic movements in 2022. Operating assumption changes and experience variances were negative $(343) million on a net basis compared with $(186) million in 2022. This reflects short-term industry-wide increases in lapses in Vietnam, following negative consumer sentiment in the wider industry, along with unfavourable morbidity experience on some medical reimbursement products following the removal of Covid-19 restrictions. We have also continued to invest in our strategic capabilities.\n\nThe non-operating loss of $(834) million (2022: loss of $(7,530) million) is largely driven by the combined impact of negative equity returns in Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, with interest rate falls and narrowing credit spreads in many of our markets in the year. These effects were more muted than in the prior year.\n\nOverall, EEV shareholders' equity increased to $45.3 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $42.2 billion). Of this, $41.5 billion (31 December 2022: $38.9 billion) relates to the insurance business operations, excluding goodwill attributable to equity shareholders. This amount includes our share of our India associate valued using embedded value principles. The market capitalisation of this associate at 31 December 2023 was circa $9.3 billion, which compares with a publicly reported embedded value of circa $4.6 billion at 30 September 2023.\n\nEEV shareholders' equity on a per share basis at 31 December 2023 was 1,643 cents (31 December 2022: 1,534 cents).",

The Group total includes the Group's share of the amounts earned by all insurance business joint ventures and associates.\n\n## Capital management\n\nWe aim to invest capital to write new business that generates three times the amount invested, at internal rates of return above 25 per cent with less than four-year payback periods. Our ability to invest at attractive returns will drive our capital allocation priorities which are as follows:\n\n- - We will continue to target resilient capital buffers such that the Group shareholder coverage ratio is above 150 per cent of the shareholder Group Prescribed Capital Requirement to ensure the Group can withstand volatility in markets and operational experience;\n- - Otherwise, our priority for allocating capital will be re-investing in new business. Our resilient capital position allows us to prioritise investment in new business with an aim to write quality new business while managing the initial capital strain and capturing the economic value at attractive returns;\n- - Our next priority is investing around $1 billion in core capabilities, primarily in the areas of Customer, Distribution, Health and Technology;\n- - Our dividend policy remains linked to net operating free surplus generation which is calculated after investment in new business and capability investment;\n\n- - We will invest in inorganic opportunities where there is good strategic fit; and\n- - All investment decisions will be made against the alternative of returning surplus capital to shareholders but given the abundance of organic and inorganic opportunities ahead of us, we are confident that in the near-term we will be reinvesting capital at attractive returns.\n\nTo generate capital to allocate to these priorities we will also prioritise managing our in-force embedded value to ensure maximum conversion into free surplus over time. Based on the economic and other assumptions and methodology that underpinned our EEV reporting at the end of 2023, we expect to transfer over $9 billion by end of 2027 from VIF and required capital to operating free surplus generated from our in-force insurance business at the end of 2023. This is before allowing for the incremental effect of new business and any return on the underlying assets backing that surplus. We will drive improved emergence of free surplus by managing claims, expense and persistency in each market. This additional free surplus will enable our continued investment in profitable new business at attractive returns, as well as in our strategic capabilities, and support payments of returns to shareholders including dividends.",

        "page_content": "## Group free surplus generation\n\nFree surplus is the metric we use to measure the internal cash generation of our business operations and broadly reflects the amount of money available to our operational businesses for investing in new business, strengthening our capacity and capabilities to grow the business, and potentially paying returns to the Group. For our insurance businesses it largely represents the Group's available regulatory capital resources after allowing for the prescribed required regulatory capital held to support the policies in issue, with a number of adjustments so that the free surplus better reflects resources potentially available for distribution to the Group. For our asset\n\nmanagement businesses, Group holding companies and other noninsurance companies, the measure is based on IFRS net assets with certain adjustments, including to exclude accounting goodwill and to align the treatment of capital with our regulatory basis.\n\nOperating free surplus generation represents amounts emerging from the in-force business during the year, net of amounts reinvested in writing new business.

The cost of investment in new business increased by 33 per cent to $(733) million largely reflecting the increase in APE sales of 37 per cent. As a consequence, the Group generated an operating free surplus from insurance and asset management operations before restructuring costs of $2,007 million, down (8) per cent compared to 2022.\n\nAfter allowing for lower central costs and restructuring and IFRS 17 costs, total Group free surplus generation was up 3 per cent to $1,395 million.\n\nAfter allowing for short-term market and currency losses, the redemption of debt (which is treated as capital for free surplus purposes), and the external dividend payment, free surplus at 31 December 2023 was $12.5 billion as compared to $12.2 billion at the start of the year. Excluding distribution rights and other intangibles, free surplus was $8.5 billion (31 December 2022: $8.4 billion).",

Dividends are expected to grow broadly in line with the growth in the Group's operating free surplus generation, and will be set taking into account financial prospects, investment opportunities and market conditions.\n\nRecognising the strong conviction we have in the Group's new strategy, the Board indicated alongside the strategy update in August 2023, that when determining the annual dividend, it intended to look through the investments in new business and investments in capabilities, and expected the annual dividend to grow in the range 7 - 9 per cent per annum over 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Board has applied this approach to determining the 2023 second interim cash dividend, and has approved a 2023 second interim cash dividend of 14.21 cents per share (2022: 13.04 cents per share). Combined with the first interim cash dividend of 6.26 cents per share (2022: 5.74 cents per share), the Group's total 2023 cash dividend is\n\n20.47 cents per share (2022: 18.78 cents per share), an increase of 9 per cent.\n\nThe Board intends to maintain this approach, and continues to expect the 2024 annual dividend to grow in the range 7 - 9 per cent.\n\n## Group capital position\n\nThe Prudential Group applies the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules set out in the GWS Framework issued by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority ('HKIA') to determine Group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels). The GWS Group capital adequacy requirements require that total eligible Group capital resources are not less than the GPCR and that GWS Tier 1 group capital resources are not less than the GMCR. More information is set out in note I(i) of the Additional financial information.\n\nThe Group holds material participating business in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Alongside the regulatory GWS capital basis, a shareholder GWS capital basis is also presented which excludes the contribution to the Group GWS eligible Group capital resources, the GMCR and the GPCR from these participating funds.\n\n|                                            | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                            | Shareholder   | Policyholder* | Total \u2020       | Shareholder   | Policyholder* | Total \u2020       |\n| Group capital resources ($bn)              | 24.3          | 14.3          | 38.6          | 23.2          | 12.6          | 35.8          |\n| of which: Tier 1 capital resources ($bn)   | 17.1          | 1.2           | 18.3          | 15.9          | 1.5           | 17.4          |\n| Group Minimum Capital Requirement ($bn)    | 4.8           | 1.1           | 5.9           | 4.4           | 0.9           | 5.3           |\n| Group Prescribed Capital Requirement ($bn) | 8.2           | 11.4          | 19.6          | 7.6           | 10.1          | 17.7          |\n| GWS capital surplus over GPCR ($bn)        | 16.1          | 2.9           | 19.0          | 15.6          | 2.5           | 18.1          |\n| GWS coverage ratio over GPCR (%)           | 295 %         |               | 197 %         | 307%          |               | 202%          |\n| GWS Tier 1 surplus over GMCR ($bn)         |               |               | 12.4          |               |               | 12.1          |\n| GWS Tier 1 coverage ratio over GMCR (%)    |               |               | 313 %         |               |               | 328%          |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the estimated shareholder GWS capital surplus over the GPCR is $16.1 billion (31 December 2022: $15.6 billion), representing a coverage ratio of 295 per cent (31 December 2022: 307 per cent) and the estimated total GWS capital surplus over the GPCR is $19.0 billion (31 December 2022: $18.1 billion) representing a coverage ratio of 197 per cent (31 December 2022: 202 per cent). During January 2023 the Group redeemed $0.4 billion of senior debt equivalent to a reduction of 5 percentage points to the shareholders' GWS coverage ratio over GPCR measured at 31 December 2022 and a 2 percentage points reduction to total GWS coverage ratio over GPCR measured at the same date.\n\nOperating capital generation in 2023 was $1.4 billion after allowing for central costs and the investment in new business. This was offset by the payment of external dividends of $(0.5) billion.\n\nThe Group's GWS position is resilient to external macroeconomic movements as demonstrated by the sensitivity disclosure contained in note I(i) of the Additional financial information, alongside further information about the GWS measure.",

The Group's leverage target is to be between 20 and 25 per cent on a Moody's total leverage basis over the medium term. Moody's have not finalised how they will calculate leverage under IFRS 17 but are consulting on a proposal to consider up to 50 per cent of any company's CSM as equity. This has yet to be incorporated into Moody's formal methodology and hence has not been incorporated into the Group's target above. At 31 December 2023, we estimate that our Moody's total leverage was 20 per cent 2 (31 December\n\n2022: 21 per cent 2 , before allowing for the \u00a3300 million senior bonds redeemed in January 2023). This would reduce to circa 14 per cent (31 December 2022: 15 per cent, before allowing for the \u00a3300 million senior bonds redeemed in January 2023) if a 50 per cent equity credit for the CSM was provided.\n\nPrudential seeks to maintain its financial strength rating with applicable credit rating agencies, which derives, in part, from its high level of financial flexibility to issue debt and equity instruments, which is intended to be maintained in the future.\n\n## Net core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed businesses\n\n|                                                                    | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2023 $m        | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m        | 31 Dec 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                    | IFRS basis       | Mark-to- market value | EEV basis        | IFRS basis       | Mark-to-market  value | EEV basis        |\n| Borrowings of shareholder-financed businesses                      | 3,933            | (274)                 | 3,659            | 4,261            | (427)                 | 3,834            |\n| Less: holding company cash and short-term investments              | (3,516)          | -                     | (3,516)          | (3,057)          | -                     | (3,057)          |\n| Net core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed  businesses | 417              | (274)                 | 143              | 1,204            | (427)                 | 777              |\n| Moody's total leverage                                             | 20%              |                       |                  | 21%              |                       |                  |\n\nThe total borrowings of the shareholder-financed businesses were $3.9 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $4.3 billion). The Group had central cash resources of $(3.5) billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $(3.1) billion), resulting in net core structural borrowings of the shareholder-financed businesses of $0.4 billion at end of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $1.2 billion). We have not breached any of the requirements of our core structural borrowings nor modified any of their terms during 2023.\n\nOn 20 January 2023 the Group redeemed \u00a3300 million ($371 million) senior bonds as they reached their maturity, and on 10 July 2023 the Group redeemed a \u20ac20m ($22 million) medium-term note as it fell due on 10 July 2023. In addition, the Group has a $750 million perpetual note that reached its first call date in January 2023 at which time the Group's management elected not to call it. We retain the right to call this security at par on a quarterly basis hereafter. The Group's remaining securities have contractual maturities that fall between 2029 and 2033. Further analysis of the maturity profile of the borrowings is presented in note C5.1 to the IFRS financial results.\n\nOn 2 March 2023 the Group's parent company, Prudential plc, transferred all of its borrowings to a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Prudential Funding (Asia) plc. Prudential plc has provided a guarantee to holders of the debt instruments in the event of default by Prudential Funding (Asia) plc. Other terms of the borrowings, and the value recognised by the Group, were unchanged by this transfer.\n\nIn addition to its net core structural borrowings of shareholderfinanced businesses set out above, the Group has structures in place to enable access to funding via the medium-term note programme, the US shelf programme (the platform for issuance of SEC registered bonds in the US market), a commercial paper programme and committed revolving credit facilities. All of these are available for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the Group's commercial paper programme are not included in the holding company cash and short-term investment balance.\n\nPrudential plc has maintained a consistent presence as an issuer in the commercial paper market for the past decade and had $699 million in issue at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $501 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had a total of $2.6 billion of undrawn committed facilities, expiring in 2026. Apart from small drawdowns to test the process, these facilities have never been drawn, and there were no amounts outstanding at 31 December 2023. The Group has reviewed its requirements for committed facilities and after the balance sheet date on15 February 2024, the Group renewed its undrawn committed facilities for a total of $1.6 billion expiring 2029.",

Remittances were used to meet central outflows of $(504) million (2022: $(656) million) and to pay dividends of $(533) million (2022: $(474) million).\n\nCentral outflows include net interest paid of $(51) million (2022: $(204) million), which is net of interest and similar income earned on central cash balances in 2023, largely on balances brought into the updated definition of holding company cash and short-term investments at the end of 2022. In addition, lower interest payments were made on core structural borrowings in 2023 as compared with the prior year.\n\nCash outflows for corporate expenditure of $(271) million (2022: $(232) million) include cash outflows for restructuring costs.\n\nOther cash flow movements included net receipts from other corporate activities of $226 million (2022: $248 million) comprising largely of proceeds received from the sale of our remaining shares in Jackson Financial Inc. as well as dividend receipts. In 2023, the Group redeemed senior bonds as they reached their maturity at a cost of $393 million.\n\nThe Group will continue to seek to manage its financial condition such that it has sufficient resources available to provide a buffer to support the retained businesses in stress scenarios and to provide liquidity to service central outflows.\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Adjusted release of CSM reflects an adjustment to the release of CSM figure as shown in note C3.2 of the IFRS financial results of $(3) million (2022: $23 million) for the treatment adopted for adjusted operating purposes of combining losses on onerous contracts and gains on profitable contracts that can be shared across more than one annual cohort.

CPL benefits from the strong brands of both shareholders with a truly multi-distribution platform offering a diverse set of products to meet customers' needs.\n\nCPL is an established franchise with an extensive footprint across 23 branches covering 102 cities. CPL is focused on the affluent and advanced affluent segments of the market where personal income levels from these segments have more economic resilience and which are still significantly under penetrated. CPL has a high quality agency force and an extensive network of 62 bancassurance partners with access to over 5,600 branches across the Chinese Mainland.\n\nDuring December 2023 Prudential announced that it was providing additional growth capital to CPL of RMB1.25 billion (US$176 million) in cash, with CITIC, its joint venture partner providing an equal amount. The additional capital supports new business growth and improves CPL's regulatory capitalisation. The business will be focused on margin maintenance, strong risk management through a rebalanced product mix and seeking quality growth in its agency channel through targeted agent recruitment and improved productivity and from improved penetration of its customer bases of its bank partners.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nDuring 2023 CPL pro-actively diversified its products with a pivot towards whole-life products and higher margin annuity and longerpremium payment term products. The re-pricing approach was ratified by the regulator in the second half of 2023 with further regulatory guidance on expense control for the bancassurance channel, and was implemented well ahead of the industry.\n\nConsequently, 2023 saw new business profit in CPL fall by (40) per cent reflecting both lower volumes and adverse economic impacts. Bancassurance channel sales declined driven by the regulatory reform on expense control of the channel mentioned above,  which was partially offset by growth in the agency channel. Excluding the effects of interest rates and other economic movements, new business\n\nmargin grew by six percentage points as a result of actions to rebalance the product proposition. Including the effects of economics the new business margin declined by two percentage points.\n\nCPL has grown long term protection APE sales by 27 per cent with strong whole life protection propositions and enhanced critical illness features targeting elderly and infants.\n\nCPL's agency business saw an increase in APE sales and new business profit reflecting an increase in the productivity of our agents and a high agent activation rate. We have seen an increase in agent productivity in the year, both in terms of policies sold per agent (up 11 per cent) and new business profit per agent (up 26 per cent). The agents provisionally qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) in 2023 increased by 19 per cent to more than 1,000 along with an increase in new agents by 6 per cent.\n\nAs previously noted, during 2023 CPL proactively rebalanced its bancassurance sales mix between whole-life products and higher margin annuity and longer-premium payment term products. CPL's bancassurance business was further affected by expense regulatory reforms during the second half of the year. As a result APE sales through the bancassurance channel fell materially. We see the recent regulatory driven transformations as conducive to the long-term development of the insurance industry particularly on health and protection and retirement. We believe these transformations and other actions in 2023, leave CPL well positioned to grow in the future.\n\nThe adjusted operating profit for our business in the Chinese Mainland, CPL, increased by 43 per cent to $368 million, reflecting an increased longer-term net investment result given a higher asset base from increased sales of savings products in recent years and a reduction in the losses from the contracts classified as onerous under IFRS 17. The IFRS loss after tax for the year was $(577) million compared to $(328) million in the prior year, reflecting lower than expected equity returns and the net impact of falling interest rates on insurance assets and liabilities.",

With our newly opened Macau branch, we are present in all 11 cities 2 in the Greater Bay Area, with a population of over 85 million people 3 .\n\n## Financial performance\n\nNew business profit increased by 267 per cent to $1,411 million, largely reflecting the increase in APE sales.\n\nAPE sales for our business in Hong Kong increased by 276 per cent to $1,966 million in 2023, reflecting the strong demand from both Domestic customers and Chinese Mainland visitors as borders reopened in early 2023, with growth across all distribution channels. The Hong Kong economy continued to recover year-on-year led by inbound tourism and domestic demand, with over 26 million people from the Chinese Mainland visiting Hong Kong in 2023. Visitor numbers in the year were circa 60 per cent of that in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, while APE sales to Chinese Mainland visitors in the same period were circa 1.1 times of that in 2019, but marginally still below the levels of 2018, prior to any Covid-19 related disruption. In addition, we also saw growth of 36 per cent in our domestic segment supported by new product launches and customer campaigns.\n\nWhile savings products contribute the majority of APE sales, due to large case sizes, on a policy count basis, health and protection sales represented 58 per cent of new policy issuances, reflecting the growth in both agency and bancassurance channels.\n\nWe increased APE sales in our health business by 22 per cent and generated a new business profit for health business of $86 million, covering more than 550,000 customers.\n\nOur agency channel contributed to 70 per cent of APE sales, with robust growth of 352 per cent supported by domestic and Chinese Mainland customers. We have reached our recruitment target of hiring 4,000 agents in 2023, the vast majority of which have already had regulatory approval. Our active agents increased by 72 per cent with an increase in monthly new business profit per active agent by 128 per cent, contributing to an increase in agency channel new business profit of 294 per cent.\n\nOur bancassurance channel also saw significant growth with APE sales up 52 per cent. The proportion of APE sales comprising health and protection products increased from 5 per cent in 2022 to 13 per cent in 2023, which, together with the growth in APE sales, contributed to an increase in new business profit of 93 per cent. Of the overall bancassurance APE sales, around 68 per cent were from 'new to insurance' customers compared to 50 per cent in 2022, reflecting strong demand for our products. In advance of the reopening of border with the Chinese Mainland, we reactivated our broker network which delivered significant increase in APE sales increasing our market share and ranking in broker channel.\n\nOverall the new business margin for Hong Kong was broadly stable at 72 per cent (2022: 73 per cent), reflecting a favourable shift in channel mix to the growing agency business, offset by the impact of product mix shifts reflecting higher case sizes of relatively lower margin savings products sold to Chinese Mainland customers. Economic impacts only marginally decreased the margin. Normalisation of savings product case sizes, combined with an increase in the proportion of health and protection sales, led to favourable product mix shifts and margins increasing in the second half of the year.\n\nIn Hong Kong, adjusted operating profit was $1,013 million, down (13) per cent mainly due to reduced net investment return associated with lower opening asset balances following adverse market movements in 2022 and a lower level of positive claims and expense variance as a result of our continued investment in our strategic pillars.\n\nThe IFRS profit after tax for our Hong Kong business was $976 million compared to a loss after tax of $(742) million in 2022. The loss in 2022 largely reflected investment losses given the large increase in interest rates in that period. This compares to a more stable interest rate environment in 2023.",

We continue to offer innovative products, through a diversified distribution network. We have a leading premier agency force with a 29 per cent agency market share 1 , contributing around 80 per cent of overall APE sales. Through our dedicated Syariah life insurance entity, we are well positioned to meet the growing demands for Syariah solutions and support the growth of the Syariah community and economy.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOverall new business profit grew by 16 per cent to $142 million, marginally above the growth in APE sales. In the second half of 2023, new business profit grew slower than in the first half but was still a double-digit percentage increase supported by a strategic pivot from individual linked products to traditional life products and a favourable shift in channel mix towards agency business. We have revamped our unit-linked product propositions with enhanced benefits in response to new regulations governing the design, sale and management of unit-linked products (commonly known as PAYDI in the market). APE sales for our business in Indonesia grew by 15 per cent to $277 million. Health and protection APE sales grew by 18 per cent in 2023 assisted by repricing actions and medical riders upgrades.\n\nOur diversified distribution network comprises our high quality agency force, a long-standing partnership with Standard Chartered Bank and UOB, other bank partnerships and direct marketing.\n\nAPE sales for the agency channel increased by 18 per cent. The growth in agency channel sales was achieved amidst a wider industry slowdown and we saw monthly new business profit per active agent increase by 7 per cent. This was supported by our transformation programme that commenced in 2022, where we accelerated agency channel growth by revamping our sales management model, upgrading our training programme and redesigning our compensation scheme to incentivise quality sales and productivity growth as well as successful repricing. We have over 1,100 agents provisionally qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) in 2023, an increase of over 40 per cent from the prior year.\n\nIn the bancassurance channel, our strategic partnerships provide us an opportunity to provide solutions across a wide spectrum of customer segments. We saw a marginal increase in APE sales from our bancassurance channel. We continue to drive high margin health and protection business, with over 38 per cent of APE sales in the bancassurance channel from health and protection products. The integration of Citi Bank with UOB, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023, is now completed and we will be able to offer comprehensive solutions to the expanded customer base. We see long-term growth opportunities given our existing partnerships and potential for new partnerships.\n\nThe adjusted operating profit for Indonesia increased by $21 million to $221 million in 2023, following the non-repeat of losses that arose on a small portfolio of contracts that were classified as onerous under the IFRS 17 methodology in 2022.\n\nThe IFRS profit after tax for our business in Indonesia increased from $104 million to $156 million, reflecting the benefits described above along with reduced negative short-term investment variances in 2023 following the drop in interest rates during the year compared to higher interest rates in 2022.",

In the young segment, we continue to provide comprehensive investment linked propositions along with various health and protection riders, while in the case of the family segment, we provide core investment linked propositions, affordable health solution and savings solutions.\n\nIn Malaysia, our diversified distribution network is complemented by a premier agency force and our bank partnerships with Standard Chartered Bank, UOB and Bank Simpanan Nasional.\n\nOur conventional and Takaful business in Malaysia featured among the top five in Life insurance customer satisfaction survey conducted by 'Bank Negara Malaysia'.\n\nThe metrics in the segment table above reflect the Group's 100 per cent economic interest in the Malaysian conventional Life business (Prudential Assurance Malaysia Berhad or PAMB) and the Group's interest in the Takaful joint venture.\n\nPrudential currently owns 51 per cent of the ordinary shares of the holding company of PAMB and a 49 per cent share in the Takaful joint venture.\n\nMarket liberalisation measures were introduced by BNM, the Malaysian insurance regulator, in April 2009, which increased the limit to 70 per cent on foreign equity ownership for insurance companies and Takaful operators in Malaysia. A higher foreign equity limit beyond 70 per cent for insurance companies will be considered by BNM on a case by case basis, for example for companies who financially support expansion of providing insurance coverage to the most vulnerable in Malaysian society through the National B40 Protection Trust Fund.\n\nWe are focused on further strengthening our franchise in Malaysia through enhancing recruitment and activation of the agency force, increasing customer penetration and breadth of our bank partners as well as actively managing our health portfolio and we will deploy capital as needed to support growth.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nNew business profit for our businesses in Malaysia grew 8 per cent to $167 million. This growth reflects an increase in APE sales of 11 per cent to $384 million, primarily driven by growth in the bancassurance channel, due to marketing campaigns and supported by the merger of UOB and Citibank that has widened the number of accessible customers. The growth in APE sales from the bancassurance channel was offset in part by a marginal decline in the agency channel.\n\nWe recruited more than 6,800 agents in 2023, and more than 550 agents provisionally qualified for Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT). Following these initiatives, we saw an increase in monthly new business profit per active agent resulting in an 8 per cent increase in new business profit, despite a marginal decline in APE sales. We continue to take actions to improve productivity by developing programs to support both new and established agents which have seen productivity increase consistently each quarter since the start of 2023.\n\nWe maintained the market leadership position in the conventional bancassurance channel, demonstrating the strength of our strategic bank partnerships. We continue to provide comprehensive propositions for the diverse needs of customers in each of the high net worth, affluent and mass market segments and we seek to increase the penetration into our bank partners' customer base. Overall we saw a 36 per cent increase in the APE sales through the bancassurance channel leading to double digit growth in new business profit.\n\nThe adjusted operating profit for our business in Malaysia declined by (7) per cent to $305 million, primarily driven by a normalisation of claims experience as the number of medical reimbursement cases returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe IFRS profit after tax for our business in Malaysia increased from $173 million to $257 million, primarily reflecting the positive impacts from the decline in interest rates in Malaysia, compared to increasing interest rates in 2022.",

We have been serving the financial needs of Singapore residents for more than 90 years, delivering a suite of product offerings and professional advice through our network of agents and financial advisors and our bank partners. Through our two strategic partners, UOB and Standard Chartered Bank, we gain access to the retail, commercial banking, and high net worth customer base of two established banks in Singapore.\n\nWe remain focused on our customers and seek to address their needs across the life stages. In the affluent segment, we offer comprehensive health and retirement solutions. We are one of the key players in the integrated Shield market (private insurance coverage that integrates with the national MediShield Life scheme), and continue to explore innovative partnerships with healthcare and technology providers to enhance our offerings. For the younger generation, we continually improve our investment-linked propositions and expand options for ESG - themed investments for customers. Finally, we serve the small and medium enterprise (SME) segment for the employee benefit business.\n\nWe received external recognition by winning No.1 Insurer The Straits Times Singapore's Best Customer Service 2023/24 survey.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n2023 saw a challenging operating environment for the life insurance industry in Singapore due to higher interest rates, particularly in the first part of the year. New business profit declined by (5) per cent to $484 million, reflecting a smaller proportion of relatively high margin single premium participating products, alongside lower APE sales.\n\nIn this context, APE sales declined by (1) per cent to $787 million. Regular premium sales have seen steady growth across 2023, with higher new business volume observed in each quarter compared with the same period in the prior year, and overall achieving double-digit growth in the year. However, sales of single premium participating products through the bancassurance channel were particularly affected by movements in interest rates in the period, contrasting with the elevated level of sales in the comparative period particularly in the first half when interest rates were favourable. In contrast overall APE sales momentum was positive in the second half of the year, with APE sales in the third quarter and fourth quarter increasing on the prior quarter driven by the expansion in regular premium business.\n\nWhile individual health and protection business have remained at a stable level in our product mix, we saw a shift in customer interest and new business sales towards investment-linked policies. While new business profit margin for the year declined overall, we saw sequential improvement across quarters during the year with growing momentum in sales of higher margin individual protection and investment-linked business.\n\nOur enterprise benefit business delivered good growth with APE sales increasing by 9 per cent, covering around 3,000 small-to-medium enterprises and over 200,000 employees. Our Shield APE grew 9 per cent over last year as we increase the provision of value-added and wellness related services to customers.\n\nOverall new business profit from the Agency channel improved by 4 per cent in the year, reflecting positive product mix effects from a growth in the proportion of sales from Shield and higher margin individual protection products. APE sales for the agency channel decreased by (4) per cent in the year. Regular premium APE sales in our agency channel grew 4 per cent compared with the prior year.\n\nAt the end of 2023 our total financial consultant force, of agents and financial advisors increased by 3 per cent when compared with 2022. Our number of eligible Agency MDRT members remained stable at over 1,280 agents in 2023.\n\nWe launched Prudential Financial Advisor channel in April 2023, which is the first financial advisory firm in the Prudential Group. PFA will offer a wide range of products and services including general insurance and wealth solutions, in addition to Prudential's core solutions in whole and term life, health & protection, savings, retirement and employee benefits. With this, we aim to cater to the growing and diverse needs of various customer segments in Singapore, as well as boost financial representative recruitment.\n\nReflecting the decline in high margin single premium products, bancassurance new business profit declined by (24) per cent in the year. However, bancassurance APE sales increased 2 per cent compared with the prior year. Pivoting to customer needs in this environment we have launched regular premium investment linked products and sales of these products gathered momentum in the second half of 2023. The level of regular premium business in bancassurance channel stands at 81 per cent overall in 2023, 41 percentage points higher than 2022.\n\nOur adjusted operating profit for our business in Singapore remained at similar level at $584 million, with the higher release of CSM and risk adjustment offset by a lower net investment return, following the adverse market movements in 2022 lowering the opening investment balances.\n\nThe IFRS profit after tax for our Singapore business was $512 million compared with a loss after tax of $(7) million in 2022. This largely reflected higher investment losses in 2022 following the significant increase in interest rates in that year.",

This reflects an increase in the release of CSM and net investment return aided by recent new business growth. These effects are partially offset by the elevated expenses supporting the continued investment in our strategic pillars together with less favourable claims experience.\n\nThe IFRS profit after tax and adjusted operating profit for Growth market and others also includes the tax charge on the profits for joint venture life business in Chinese Mainland and Malaysia. The IFRS profit after tax in the Growth market and other segment increased from $304 million to $775 million, largely reflecting significant investment losses in 2022 from higher interest rates in most of our markets.\n\nA detailed discussion of new business performance by key businesses in presented below.\n\n## Thailand\n\nIn Thailand we are focused on our bancassurance channel supported by alternative distribution methods including digital, agency, direct marketing and brokerage. New business profit declined by 6 per cent, largely as a result of interest rate changes. APE sales grew by 4 per cent following a high base in 2022, benefiting from double-digit growth from our UOB bank partnership and an increase in the contribution of Group employee benefit (EB) solutions.\n\nOur distribution partnerships have benefited in the year through the integration of the Citi and UOB organisations in Thailand. We also revamped our online application platform ('PRUPlus') to improve reliability and enhance the seller and customer experience. At the end of 2023 we invested in a new bancassurance partnership with CIMB, becoming the exclusive life insurance partner of CIMB Thai. Prudential Thailand seeks to accelerate its growth plans building on the fact that it is already the third largest bancassurance player in the market 1 .\n\n## Vietnam\n\nPrudential is the leading life insurance company in Vietnam, which has the third-largest population in ASEAN, and operates with a diversified distribution mix.\n\nNew business profit for our business in Vietnam declined materially, albeit there was an improvement in new business margins, particularly from the bancassurance business and interest rate effects. APE sales declined by 33 per cent, against an overall market decline of 41 per cent, reflecting an industry-wide fall in consumer sentiment. However, the business's focus on customers and the strength of its agency force has seen it outperform the market, increase its market share and retain the number one position in the market.\n\nWe continue to expand our geographical footprint in urban areas through technology-powered agency and bancassurance channels. Our diversified distribution includes our established agency force, which includes more than 1,500 agents provisionally qualified for Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT), and seven exclusive bank partnerships.\n\nWe extended our exclusive bancassurance partnership with Vietnam International bank until 2036, developing new industry-leading quality standards and contributing to the healthy and sustainable development of bancassurance in Vietnam. We continue to focus on improving sales quality and strengthening our relationships with our bank partners to widen our reach to customers through their combined 800 branches in Vietnam.\n\n## The Philippines\n\nWe are the market leader in the Philippines with 17 per cent market share 1 by weighted new business premium, based on the latest available market data reflecting the core strength of our leading agency force. With our young and digitally empowered agency force, we have one of the largest agency forces in the country. Competition for quality agents is strong and we have taken steps to retain talent. We continue to offer a wide range of products to meet our customers' savings and protection needs. New business profit in 2023 delivered double-digit growth, despite a marginal (2) per cent decline in APE sales reflecting a favourable impact from product mix and economic tailwinds. We will continue to strengthen our distribution network through onboarding and nurturing high-quality agents, equipped by digital capabilities, as well as continue to enhance customer experiences through offering comprehensive solutions and seamless customer experiences.",

        "page_content": "## India\n\nOur associate business in India, ICICI Prudential Life, successfully accomplished its objective to double its 2019 new business profit by 2023 through its '4P' strategic framework for Premium growth, Protection focus, Persistency improvement and Productivity enhancement.\n\nNew business profit was up 2 per cent with the uplift from APE sales growth being offset by adverse economics and a greater proportion of savings products being sold in the year.\n\nAPE sales for ICICI Prudential Life grew by 10 per cent, with a welldiversified distribution network enabling the company to reach a wider cross-section of customers to drive growth. The diverse distribution network comprises more than 200,000 agents including the addition of 40,000 new agents in 2023 and 42 bank partnerships with access to more than 20,000 bank branches.\n\nTo enhance distribution capabilities, ICICI Prudential has introduced 'ICICI Pru Stack' a set of platform capabilities encompassing digital tools and analytical abilities. This provides distribution partners with greater information on customers and their needs, and has enabled simplification of the buying journey, with approximately 40 per cent of long-term savings policies now issued on the same day as the purchase process starts.\n\nICICI Prudential Life, of which we hold 22 per cent, is amongst the top-four private life insurance companies in India and is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India.\n\n## Taiwan\n\nTaiwan is the fifth-largest life insurance market in Asia 4 , with a population of 24 million. Prudential is a leading insurance company in Taiwan among foreign players with an overall APE market share of 8 per cent in 2023, 3 percentage points higher than 2022. It also delivered the highest year-on-year growth rate in the industry during 2023.\n\nOur business in Taiwan provides solutions for long-term savings and protection to our target market segments. Families remains a key customer segment for Prudential Taiwan with 31,000 new customers acquired from this segment (an increase in the year of 104 per cent).\n\nIn Taiwan we saw 86 per cent APE sales growth in 2023, supported by a diversified channel mix in bancassurance and brokerage channels, with strong local bank partners performance as supported by key products campaign and initiatives. Our newly nurtured bank partners delivered over double-digit APE sales growth compared to last year, and contributed to 34 per cent of APE sales in 2023. The sales performance was attributable to our offering of tailored solutions to fulfil specific customer needs across saving, protection and medical needs in different life stages with different currencies. New business profit rose, driven by this increase in APE sales as well as favourable product mix changes. The business is focused on further improving margins.\n\n## Africa\n\nDespite macro-economic uncertainties and in particular higher inflation, APE sales for Africa grew by 26 per cent in 2023, with double-digit growth in both agency and bancassurance sales. Six out of the eight markets delivered double-digit growth in the new business profit in the year. This resulted from an improved channel and product mix, alongside the growth in APE sales, which led to 33 per cent increase in new business profit.\n\nIn Africa, Prudential has an established agency force with over 300 agents who qualified for Million Dollar Round Table membership. In addition, Prudential Africa has added 13 additional bank partners in the year, given us access to over 1,700 bank branches in total.\n\nWe will continue to focus our investment and capital on those markets which are large and in which we see the long-term attractive returns.",

Its funds under management or advice (referred collectively as funds under management or FUM) of $237.1 billion includes $38.5 billion that represents our 49 per cent share in funds managed by ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company (IPAMC) in India and $9.7 billion that represents our 49 per cent share in funds managed by CITIC-Prudential Fund Management Company Limited (CPFMC) in China. Eastspring has $141.0 billion of funds under management on behalf of the Prudential Group.\n\n## Investment performance\n\nEastspring's investment performance saw 44 per cent of FUM outperforming their benchmarks over the past year (2022: 59 per cent) and 50 per cent of FUM outperforming their benchmarks over the past three years (2022: 39 per cent). Whilst, there was a decline in one-year outperformance when compared to 2022  mainly driven by underperformance in three multi-asset portfolios, the Singapore-based Value Equity teams continued their substantial outperformance. Both the Growth Equities and Active Quantitative strategies also posted positive aggregate returns across one and three years. The Singaporebased Fixed Income team was also able to turnaround the underperformance experienced in 2022, with 90 per cent of FUM outperforming their benchmarks in 2023. We continued to upgrade our investment and risk management platform for multi-asset strategies and investment performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarter.\n\nEastspring also continued to develop its investment platform and capabilities through a series of strategic hires, notably in portfolio risk management and fixed income, and through investment process enhancements across the various teams. Further work was progressed in integrating Eastspring's investment performance for wholly-owned businesses and aligning common investment practices, including research.\n\nEastspring continued to be recognised for its achievements, being named Best Emerging Markets Equity Manager by Citywire Asia Asset Management Awards for the second consecutive year and Best Value Investing Manager regionally by Asia Asset Management.\n\n## Broadening distribution capabilities\n\nEastspring's strategy is anchored on understanding its clients and delivering strong capabilities and products for their bespoke needs. In 2023, Eastspring continued to extend and deepen its relationships with third-party clients and Prudential Life Companies which has generated positive net inflows.\n\nEastspring continued to build retail partnerships with distributors and banks. Notably in Japan, the firm expanded its partnerships to more than 120 retail distributors and converged 22,800 attendees through 274 workshops and client seminars.\n\nAcross the institutional business, the firm has seen success in its international markets of the Americas, Europe, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\n## Accelerating responsible investing\n\nEastspring's commitment to responsible investing is embedded across its business.\n\nAcross its markets, Eastspring is focused on driving sustainable solutions on three fronts. First, Eastspring extended its engagement programme beyond climate change to include themes of palm oil, unsustainable timber, and modern slavery. Second, the firm enhanced its ESG data analytics to support investment activities via the creation of a proprietary ESG assessment visualiser and enhanced client reporting tools for climate risk, UN Sustainable Development Goal alignment and Scope 3 carbon emissions. Third, the firm published its first Responsible Investment Report and improved its United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) assessment.\n\n## Open-architecture technology platform\n\nEastspring has embarked on a multi-year firm-wide transformation journey to modernise its business. This includes upgrading its operating model for robustness and scalability, as well as enhancing its control environment.\n\nThrough HERA, Eastspring's proprietary cloud-native Data & AI platform, Eastspring is making good progress in its ambition to become a datadriven organisation. Eastspring is already seeing benefits from its early efforts in the form of an automated Finance 'data-mart' for end to end reporting, optimising insights across markets, and building robust data for monitoring and regulatory purposes. The platform has also powered climate insights for our portfolio and strengthened realtime risk management through its investment risk insights.\n\n## Joint venture growth initiatives\n\nIn India, IPAMC strengthened its distribution capabilities, servicing a direct client base spread across 300 cities in India. This resulted a 17 per cent increase in IPAMC's client base to over 9 million; of which around 33 per cent were direct clients. In addition, IPAMC broadened its product suite into the alternatives segment focused on private equity and private credit, and raised $324 million (100 per cent shareholding basis). Reflecting net inflows coupled with a favourable equity market performance, FUM for IPAMC grew by 28 per cent (on actual exchange rate basis).\n\nIn China, CPFMC is looking to broaden its product suite with new fixed income and quantitative products. CPFMC also strengthened its distribution capabilities with 14 new partnerships, comprising of 10 bank wealth management companies and 4 securities firms. The depth of our partnership, including the e-commerce platforms has generated strong net inflows, primarily from money market funds supporting a 8 per cent increase (on actual exchange rate basis) in FUM for CPFMC, despite the challenging economic environment.",

|\n\nEastspring's total funds under management and advice (FUM) increased by 7 per cent to $237.1 billion (31 December 2022: $221.4 billion on actual exchange rate), reflecting favourable market movements, and net inflows from third parties (excluding M&G plc) and the Group's life business. In 2023, there was a shift in overall asset mix from bonds to equity and multi-assets funds, while the overall assets remain well diversified across both clients and asset classes.\n\nThird party net inflows (excluding money market funds and funds managed on behalf of M&G plc) were $4.1 billion (2022: net outflows of $(1.5) billion) reflecting inflows into higher margin retail funds. This was more than offset by net outflows of $(7.6) billion (2022: $(0.8) billion) from the expected redemption of funds managed on behalf of M&G plc, with further net outflows of about $(0.6) billion expected\n\nin 2024. In addition, net inflows from Prudential's life business were $2.3 billion (2022: $8.0 billion).\n\nThe average FUM decreased by (2) per cent compared to 7 per cent increase in closing FUM, largely reflecting the adverse market movements in 2022. Eastspring's adjusted operating profit increased by 10 per cent to $280 million, reflecting a circa $20 million net investment gain, reported within operating income before performance-related fees (as compared with a net investment loss of circa $10 million  in the prior year) on shareholders' investments including seed capital. Excluding the gains and losses on shareholders' investments from both periods, operating profit was (2) per cent lower, consistent with the decline in average FUM. There was an improvement in the fee margin and cost/income ratio, reflecting the higher mix from retail equity funds and the investment gains as noted above.\n\n## Notes",

As Prudential focuses on executing its new strategy across Asia and Africa, the Group-wide Risk, Compliance and Security (RCS) function has continued to provide risk advice, recommendations and assurance, as well as engage with Prudential's Group-wide supervisor, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA), on critical activities, while overseeing the risks and implications to the ongoing business with the goal of ensuring that the Group remains within its approved risk appetite. The Group effectively leverages its risk management, compliance and security experience in more mature markets, applying it to its growth markets as appropriate to their respective risks and the extent of their challenges under the complex operating environment, and reflective of opportunities, customer issues and needs, and local customs. Prudential will continue to take a holistic and coordinated approach in managing the increasingly dynamic, multifaceted and often interconnected risks facing its businesses.\n\nBelow we explain how we manage risk, including through our risk governance framework and processes. We then describe the principal risks the Group faces, including how each principal risk is managed and mitigated, followed by a detailed description of the specific risk factors that may affect our business, the Group and our stakeholders.\n\n## 2 Risk governance\n\n## a System of governance\n\nPrudential has in place a system of governance that embeds a clear ownership of risk, together with risk policies and standards to enable risks to be identified, measured and assessed, managed and controlled, monitored and reported. The Group Risk Framework, owned by the Board, details Prudential's risk governance, risk management processes and risk appetite. The Group's risk governance arrangements are based on the 'three lines' model. The 'first line' is responsible for taking and managing risk within the risk appetite, while the 'second line' provides additional independent challenge, expertise and oversight to support risk and compliance management. The role of the 'third line', assumed by the independent Group-wide Internal Audit function, is to provide objective assurance on the design, effectiveness and implementation of the overall system of internal control. The Group-wide RCS function reviews, assesses, oversees and reports on the Group's aggregate risk exposure and solvency position from an economic, regulatory and credit ratings perspective.\n\nIn 2023, continuous efforts have been made to ensure the appropriateness of the level of Group governance that promotes individual accountability in decision-making and supports the overall corporate governance framework to provide sound and prudent management and oversight of the Group's business. The Group also regularly reviews the Group Risk Framework and supporting policies, including to ensure sustainability considerations, which form an integral part of the wider Group governance, are appropriately reflected in policies and processes and embedded within all business functions.\n\n## b Group Risk Framework\n\n## i. Risk governance and culture\n\nPrudential's risk governance comprises the Board organisational structures, reporting relationships, delegation of authority, roles and responsibilities, and risk and compliance policies that have been established to enable business decision-making with respect to control activities and risk-related matters. The Group Risk Committee (GRC) leads the risk governance structure, supported by independent Non-executive Directors on the risk committees of the Group's major businesses. The GRC approves changes to the Group Risk Framework and the core risk and compliance policies that support it, and has direct lines of communication, reporting and oversight of the risk committees of the Group's major businesses. The chief risk and compliance officers of the Group's major businesses and the managing directors of the Group's Strategic Business Groups are also invited to the Group Executive Risk Committee, the advisory committee to the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. The chief risk and compliance officers of the Group's major businesses also attend GRC meetings on a rotational basis.\n\nRisk culture is a strategic priority of the Board, which recognises its importance in the way the Group conducts business. A revised set of fundamental values was rolled out across the Group in 2023, referred to as 'The PruWay', that serves as the Group's guiding principles to ethical and authentic conduct. These values apply equally to all members of Prudential and its affiliates. The Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG) supports its responsibilities in relation to implementation of sound culture considerations in the ways we operate, as well as embedding the Group's Sustainability Strategy and overseeing progress on customer, culture, people and community matters. The PruWay defines how Prudential expects business to be conducted to achieve its strategic objectives, to build a culture of trust and transparency that allows our people to thrive, and to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders: customers, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe Group Risk Framework and underlying policies support sound risk management practices by requiring a focus on customers, longer-term goals and sustainability, the avoidance of excessive risk taking, and highlighting acceptable and unacceptable behaviours. This is supported by: the inclusion of risk and sustainability considerations in performance management and remuneration for key executives; the building of appropriate skills and capabilities in risk management; and ensuring that employees understand and care about their role in managing risk through open discussions, collaboration and engagement. The GRC has a key role in providing advice to the Remuneration Committee on risk management considerations to be applied in respect of executive remuneration.\n\nPrudential's Group Code of Conduct and Group Governance Manual, supported by the Group's risk-related policies, are reviewed regularly. A revised Group Code of Conduct (the Code) was launched in November 2023 to further enhance risk culture and awareness underpinning operational and financial discipline. The Code lays down the principles and guidelines that outline the ethical standards and responsibilities of the organisation and our people. Supporting policies include those related to financial crime, covering anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-bribery",

The Group's Third-Party Supply and Outsourcing Policy requires that human rights and modern slavery considerations are embedded in material supplier arrangements. Procedures to allow individuals to speak out safely and anonymously against unethical behaviours and conduct violations are also in place.\n\nFurther details on the Group's sustainability governance arrangements and strategic framework are included in the Group's 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\n## ii. The risk management cycle\n\nThe Group Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) is the ongoing process of identifying, measuring and assessing, managing and controlling, monitoring and reporting the risks to which the business is exposed. It includes an assessment of capital adequacy to ensure that the Group's solvency needs are met at all times, as well as stress and scenario testing that also includes climate scenarios.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nThe Group identifies principal risks in accordance with provision 28 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) guidelines issued by the HKIA. The Group performs a robust assessment and analysis of principal and emerging risk themes through the risk identification process, the Group ORSA report and the risk assessments undertaken as part of the business planning review, including how they are managed and mitigated, which supports decision-making. Top-down and bottom-up processes are in place to support Group-wide identification of principal risks. The Group's principal risks, which are reported and managed by the Group with enhanced focus, are reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\n\nAn emerging risk identification framework also exists to support the Group's preparations in managing financial and non-financial risks expected to crystallise beyond the short-term horizon. The Group's emerging risk identification process recognises the dynamic materiality of emerging risk themes, whereby the topics and the associated risks that are important to the Group and its respective key stakeholders can change over time, often very quickly. This is often seen for sustainability (including environmental, social and governance (ESG) and climate-related) risks, which impact the Group's reputation given evolving stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe risk profile assessment is a key output from the risk identification and risk measurement processes and is used as a basis for setting Group-wide limits and assessment of management actions which could be taken to conserve and aid stakeholder value creation.\n\n## Risk measurement and assessment\n\nAll identified risks are assessed based on an appropriate methodology for that risk. Quantifiable risks which are material and mitigated by holding capital are modelled in the Group's internal model, which is used to determine the Group Internal Economic Capital Assessment (GIECA) with robust processes and controls on model changes. The GIECA model and results are subject to independent validation.\n\n## Risk management and control\n\nThe Group's control procedures and systems focus on aligning the levels of risk taking with the Group's strategy and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Group's risk policies define the Group's appetite for material risks and set out the risk management and control requirements to limit exposure. These policies also set out the processes to enable the measurement and management of these risks in a consistent and coherent way, including the flows of management information required. Stress and scenario testing is also in place to assess the robustness of capital adequacy and liquidity and the appropriateness of risk limits, as well as to support recovery planning. This includes reverse stress testing which requires the Group to ascertain the point of business model failure and is another tool that helps to identify the key risks and scenarios that may have a material impact\n\non the Group. The methods and risk management tools employed to mitigate each of the Group's principal risks are detailed in section 3 below.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nThe Group's principal risks are highlighted in the management information received by the GRC and the Board, which also includes key exposures against appetite and developments in the Group's principal and emerging risks.\n\n## iii. Risk appetite, limits and triggers\n\nThe Group aims to balance the interests of the broad spectrum of its stakeholders (including customers, investors, employees, communities and key business partners) and understands that a well-managed acceptance of risk lies at the heart of its business. The Group generates stakeholder value by selectively taking exposure to risks, mitigated to the extent it is cost-effective to do so, and where these are an outcome of its chosen business activities and strategy. Those risks for which the Group has no tolerance are actively avoided. The Group's systems, procedures and controls are designed to manage risk appropriately, and its approach to resilience and recovery aims to maintain the Group's ability and flexibility to respond in times of stress.\n\nQualitative and quantitative expressions of risk appetite are defined and operationalised through risk limits, triggers and indicators. The RCS function reviews the appropriateness of these measures at least annually. The Board approves changes to the Group's aggregate risk appetite and the GRC has delegated authority to approve changes to the system of limits, triggers and indicators.\n\nGroup risk appetite is defined and monitored in aggregate by the setting of objectives for its capital requirements, liquidity and nonfinancial risk exposure, covering risks to stakeholders, including those from participating and third-party businesses. Group limits operate within these expressions of risk appetite to constrain material risks, while triggers and indicators provide additional defined points for escalation. The GRC, supported by the RCS function, is responsible for reviewing the risks inherent in the Group's business plan and for providing the Board with a view on the risk/reward trade-offs and the resulting impact to the Group's aggregated position relative to Group risk appetite and limits, including non-financial risk considerations.\n\n- 1. Capital requirements: Limits on capital requirements aim to ensure that, in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions, the Group maintains adequate capital in excess of internal economic capital requirements and regulatory capital requirements, achieves its desired target credit rating to meet its business objectives, and the need for supervisory intervention is avoided. The two measures in use at the Group level are the GWS and GIECA capital requirements.\n- 2. Liquidity: The objective of the Group's liquidity risk appetite is to help ensure that appropriate cash resources are available to meet financial obligations as they fall due in both business-as-usual and stressed scenarios. This is measured using a liquidity coverage ratio which considers the sources of liquidity against liquidity requirements under stress scenarios.\n- 3. Non-financial risks: The Non-Financial Risk Appetite Framework is in place to identify, measure and assess, manage and control, monitor and report effectively on material non-financial risks across the business. The non-financial risk appetite is framed around the perspectives of its varied stakeholders, accounts for current and expected changes in the external environment, and provides limit and trigger appetite thresholds for non-financial risk categories across the Group's locations. The Group accepts a degree of non-financial risk exposure as an outcome of its chosen business activities and strategy, and aims to manage these risks effectively to maintain its operational resilience and its commitments to customers and all stakeholders and avoid material adverse financial loss or impact to its reputation.",

For example, while headline inflation has moved down in 2023, core inflation has remained well above central bank targets and central banks may need to maintain tight monetary policies to rein in inflation, which could exert downward pressures on growth. In the major emerging markets, inflation has generally been less severe and monetary policies have been less restrictive. However, this environment of relatively high global interest rates presents a meaningful recession risk and is putting pressure on banks' balance sheets and margins. This could result in a pullback in both credit supply and credit demand and lead to a sharper tightening in global credit conditions. Challenges in the US and EU banking sector increased risk in the US commercial real estate sector. The weak growth and concerns around the Chinese Mainland property sector not only put a toll on the Chinese Mainland economy and place downward pressure on China interest rate, but could also weigh on the broader Asian region and the global economy's vitality going forward. A number of issuers within the Chinese Mainland property sector and the US commercial real estate sector experienced a reduction in financial strength and flexibility of corporate entities in 2023, although the overall impact to the Group's invested credit portfolio was immaterial due to our diversified investment strategy. The serviceability of sovereign debt also posed some concerns in certain economies (particularly the high indebtedness across countries in Africa, such as the sovereign debt restructuring in Ghana).\n\nGeopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Gaza, as well as the Chinese Mainland and countries such as the United States and India, continued to contribute to the slow and/or negative global or regional economic growth in 2023. These conflicts may lead to further realignment among blocs or global polarisation and decoupling.\n\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical developments are considered material to the Group and can potentially increase operational and business disruption (including sanctions) and regulatory and financial market risks, and have the potential to directly impact Prudential's sales and distribution networks, as well as its reputation. The potential impacts to the Group are included in sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Risk factors.\n\n## Market risks to our investments\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe value of Prudential's direct investments is impacted by fluctuations in equity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and property prices. There is also potentially indirect impact through the value of the net equity of its joint ventures and associates. Although inflation remains at decades-level highs in certain global markets, the Group's direct exposure to inflation remains modest. Exposure mainly arises through an increase in medical claims obligations, driven by rising medical prices as well as potential impact on customers from an affordability perspective. Medical inflation risk as well as challenges for insurers linked to affordability and existing challenges in persistency are detailed in the Insurance risks section below.\n\nThe Group has appetite for market risk where it arises from profitgenerating insurance activities to the extent that it remains part of a balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and is compatible with a robust solvency position. The Group's market risks are managed and mitigated by the following:\n\n- - The Group Market Risk Policy;\n- - The Group Capital and Asset Liability Management (ALM) Committee and Group ALM Policy;\n- - Changes in asset allocation, bonus revisions, repricing and the use of reinsurance where appropriate;\n- - The Group Investment Committee and Group Investment Policy;\n- - Hedging using derivatives, including currency forwards and swaps, bond forwards/futures, interest rate futures and swaps, and equity futures;\n- - The monitoring and oversight of market risks through the regular reporting of management information;\n- - Regular deep dive assessments; and\n- - The Group Critical Incident Procedure (GCIP), which defines specific governance to be invoked in the event of a critical incident, such as a significant market, liquidity or credit-related event. This includes, where necessary, the convening of a Critical Incident Group (CIG) to oversee, coordinate, and where appropriate, direct activities during a critical incident.",

Some entities within the Group write policies, invest in assets or enter into other transactions in local currencies or currencies not linked to the Group's reporting/ functional currency, the US dollar. Although this limits the effect of exchange rate movements on local operating results, it can lead to fluctuations in the Group's US dollar-reported financial statements. This risk is further detailed in section 1.6 of the Risk factors.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nPrudential's liquidity risk arises from the need to have sufficient liquid assets to meet policyholder and third-party payments as they fall due, considered under both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. It includes the risk arising from funds composed of illiquid assets and results from a mismatch between the liquidity profile of assets and liabilities. Liquidity risk may impact market conditions and valuation of assets in a more uncertain way than other risks like interest rate or credit risk. It may arise, for example, where external capital is unavailable at sustainable cost, where derivatives transactions require a sudden significant need of liquid assets or cash to post as collateral to meet derivatives margin requirements, or where redemption requests are made against funds managed for external clients (both retail and institutional). Liquidity risk is considered material at the level of the Group.\n\nThe Group accepts the currency risk that emerges from profits retained locally to support the growth of the Group's business and the translation risks from capital being held in the local currency of the business to meet local regulatory and market requirements. However, in cases where a surplus arising in an overseas operation supports Group capital or shareholders' interest (ie remittances), this exposure is hedged if it is economically optimal to do so. The Group does not accept significant shareholder exposures to foreign exchange risks in currencies outside the local territory.\n\nForeign exchange risk is managed by the Group Capital and ALM Committee through the implementation of asset allocation on funds which captures the exposure to non-local-denominated assets.\n\nThe Group has no appetite for any business to have insufficient resources to cover its outgoing cash flows, or for the Group as a whole to not meet cash flow requirements from its debt obligations under any plausible scenario. The Group has significant internal sources of liquidity sufficient to meet its expected cash requirements for at least 12 months from the date the financial statements are approved, without having to resort to external sources of funding. The Group has a total of $1.6 billion of undrawn committed facilities that can be made use of, expiring in 2029. Access to further liquidity is available through the debt capital markets and the Group's extensive commercial paper programme. Prudential has maintained a consistent presence as an issuer in the market for the past decade.\n\nA number of risk management tools are used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk, including the following:\n\n- - The Group's Liquidity Risk Policy;\n- - Regular assessment and reporting by the Group and business units of liquidity coverage ratios, which are calculated under both base case and stressed scenarios;\n- - The Group's Liquidity Risk Management Plan;\n- - The Group's Collateral Management Framework;\n- - The Group's contingency plans and identified sources of liquidity;\n- - The Group's ability to access the money and debt capital markets; and\n- - The Group's access to external committed credit facilities.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss resulting from a borrower's failure to meet its contractual debt obligation(s). Counterparty risk, a type of credit risk, is the probability that a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligation(s) causing the other counterparty to suffer a loss. These risks arise from the Group's investments in bonds, reinsurance arrangements, derivative contracts with third parties, and its cash deposits with banks. Credit spread risk, another type of credit risk, arises when the interest rate/return on a loan or bond is disproportionately low compared with another investment with a lower risk of default. Invested credit and counterparty risks are considered a material risk for the Group's business units.\n\nThe total debt securities at 31 December 2023 held by the Group's operations were $83.1 billion (31 December 2022: $77.0 billion). The majority (83 per cent, 31 December 2022: 84 per cent) of the portfolio are investments either held in unitlinked funds or that support insurance products where policyholders participate in the returns of a specified pool of investments 1 . The gains or losses on these investments will largely be offset by movements in policyholder liabilities 2 . The remaining 17 per cent (31 December 2022: 16 per cent) of the debt portfolio (the 'shareholder debt portfolio') are investments where gains and losses broadly impact the income statement, albeit short-term market fluctuations are recorded outside of adjusted operating profit.\n\n- -Group sovereign debt : Prudential invests in bonds issued by national governments. This sovereign debt holding within the shareholder debt portfolio represented 55 per cent or $7.8 billion 3 of the total shareholder debt portfolio as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 41 per cent or $4.9 billion). The particular risks associated with holding sovereign debt are detailed further in the disclosures in the Risk factors. The total exposures held by the Group in sovereign debt securities at 31 December 2023 are given in note C1 of the Group's IFRS financial statements.\n- -Corporate debt portfolio : In the shareholder debt portfolio, corporate debt exposures totalled $5.8 billion of which $5.4 billion or 94 per cent were investment grade rated (31 December 2022: $6.6 billion of which $6.1 billion or 93 per cent were investment grade rated).\n- -Bank debt exposure and counterparty credit risk : The banking sector represents a material concentration in the Group's corporate debt portfolio which largely reflects the composition of the fixed income markets across the regions in which Prudential is invested. As such, exposure to banks is a key part of its core investments, considered to be a material risk for the Group, as well as being important for the hedging and other activities undertaken to manage its various financial risks.\n\n## At 31 December 2023:\n\n- - 94 per cent of the Group's shareholder portfolio (excluding all government and government-related debt) is investment grade rated 4 . In particular, 59 per cent of the portfolio is rated 4 A- and above (or equivalent); and\n- - The Group's shareholder portfolio is well diversified: no individual sector 5 makes up more than 13 per cent of the total portfolio (excluding the financial and sovereign sectors).\n\nThe Group's holdings across its life portfolios are mostly in local currency and with a largely domestic investor base. These portfolios are generally positioned towards high-quality names, including those with either government or considerable parent company balance sheet support. Areas which the Group is actively monitoring include ongoing developments in the global banking sector, effects of the global economic slowdown on the invested assets, the impacts of the tightening of monetary policy in the Group's key markets, higher refinancing costs, heightened geopolitical tension and protectionism, the ongoing downsizing of the Chinese Mainland property sector and more widely across the Chinese Mainland economy, as well as high indebtedness in African countries. The impacts of these closely monitored trends include potential for deterioration in the credit quality of the Group's invested credit exposures, particularly due to rising funding costs and overall credit risks, and the extent of downward pressure on the fair value of the Group's portfolios. The Group's portfolio is generally well diversified in relation to individual counterparties, although counterparty concentration is monitored, particularly in local markets where depth (and therefore the liquidity of such investments) may be low. The Group has appetite to accept credit risk to the extent that it remains part of a balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and is compatible with a robust solvency position. This risk is further detailed in sections 1.4 and 1.5 of the Risk factors.\n\nThe Group actively reviews its investment portfolio to improve the robustness and resilience of the solvency position. A number of risk management tools are used to manage and mitigate credit and counterparty credit risk, including the following:\n\n- - The Group Credit Risk Policy and the Group Dealing Controls Policy;\n- - The Global Counterparty Limit Framework and concentration limits on large names;\n- - Collateral arrangements for derivative, secured lending reverse repurchase and reinsurance transactions which aim to provide a high level of credit protection; and\n- - The Group Executive Risk Committee and Group Investment Committee's oversight of credit and counterparty credit risk and sector and/or name-specific reviews.\n\nExposure to the banking sector is considered a material risk for the Group. Derivative and reinsurance counterparty credit risk exposure is managed using an array of risk management tools, including a comprehensive system of limits. Prudential manages the level of its counterparty credit risk by reducing its exposure or using additional collateral arrangements where appropriate.",

The Group's sustainability strategy is centered on three key pillars (providing simple and accessible health and financial protection, investing responsibly and creating a sustainable business), each of which increases the expectations of the Group's stakeholders with regards to the Group's potential external environmental and social impact. Sustainability risks arise from the activities that support implementation of the Group's strategy, which include developing sustainable and inclusive offerings, continuing to decarbonise the Group's investment portfolio in a scienceinformed approach to facilitate becoming a net zero asset owner by 2050 whilst financing a just and inclusive transition, and advancing the diversity, equity and inclusion and belonging strategy to empower existing employees.\n\nPotential regulatory compliance and litigation risks exist globally and across Asia, as sustainability-related topics remain high on the agenda of both local regulators and international supervisory bodies, including the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which published its inaugural sustainability and climate-related disclosure requirements in June 2023. Delivery of the Group's Sustainability Strategy, including the decarbonisation commitments and the development of sustainable and inclusive offerings, heightens the risk of accusations of misleading or unsubstantiated representations to the extent of the environmental or societal impact of the Group's activities and the sustainability features of new products (eg greenwashing), which subsequently increases the risk of potential litigation or reputational damage. Further details of the Group's sustainability-related risks and regulations are included in sections 2.1 and 4.1 of the Risk factors.\n\nAs custodians of stakeholder value for the long term, the Group seeks to manage sustainability risks and their potential impact on its business and stakeholders through transparent and consistent implementation of its strategy in its markets and across operational, underwriting and investment activities. It is enabled by strong internal governance, sound business practices and a responsible investment approach, with sustainability-related considerations integrated into investment processes and decisions and the performance of fiduciary and stewardship duties, including via voting and active engagement decisions with respect to investee companies, as both an asset owner and an asset manager. Climate risk, the Group's reporting against the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and progress on the Group's external climaterelated commitments, remain a priority focus for the GRC for 2024. Further information on the Group's sustainability governance and strategy, as well as the management of material sustainability themes, is included in the Group's 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\nThe Group participates in networks, industry forums and working groups, such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and CRO Forum, to further develop understanding and support collaborative action in relation to sustainability risks and promoting a just and inclusive transition. The Group also actively engages with, and responds to, discussions, consultations and information-gathering exercises with local regulators, international supervisory bodies and global industry standard setters.\n\nThe Group Risk Framework continues to be critically evaluated and updated where required to ensure both sustainability-related considerations and risks to the Group, including those arising from stakeholder expectations of the external impact of the Group's activities, are appropriately captured. Risk management and mitigation of sustainability risks are embedded within the Group Risk Framework and risk processes, including:\n\n- - Consideration within the emerging risk identification and evaluation processes that emerging sustainability themes and the associated risks can potentially quickly change from immaterial to material (dynamic-materiality);\n- - Reflection in the risk taxonomy that the Group can be both impacted by sustainability issues as well as having an impact on these in the external world ('double materiality');\n- - The addition of 'social and environmental responsibility' as a strategic risk within the risk taxonomy to consider the potential risks arising from the external impact of the Group's activities;\n- - Workshops and function-wide training on specific risk themes, including sustainability risk principles, greenwashing risk and the risks associated with delivery of the Group's external responsible investment commitments;\n- - Definition of appropriate (and longer) time horizons with respect to climate risk management, and the requirement to consider time horizons where required in risk-based decision-making; and\n- - Deep dives into emerging and increasingly material sustainability themes, including climate-related risks, and development of Boardlevel and broader Group-wide training.",

Insurance risks and business concentration risks are also assumed by the Group in providing its products. Furthermore, there are risks associated with the oversight of the Group's joint ventures and associates stemming from our operation in certain markets.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nThe complexity of Prudential, its activities and the extent of transformation in progress creates a challenging operating environment and exposure to a variety of non-financial risks which are considered to be material at a Group level.\n\nThe Group's non-financial risks, which are not exhaustive and discussed further in section 3 of the Risk factors, are outlined below.\n\n## Operations processes risk\n\nOperations processes risk is the risk of failure to adequately or accurately process different types of operational transactions, including customer servicing and asset and investment management operations. Due to human error, among other reasons, operations and process control incidents do occur from time to time and no system or process can entirely prevent occurrence.\n\n## Change management risk\n\nChange management risk remains a material risk for Prudential, with a number of significant change programmes under way which, if not delivered and executed effectively with adequate and capable resources to defined timelines, scope and cost, may negatively impact its operational capability, control environment, employees, reputation and ability to deliver its strategy and maintain market competitiveness. The current portfolio of transformation and significant change programmes includes (i) the implementation and embedding of large-scale regulatory/industry changes; (ii) the expansion of the Group's digital capabilities and use of technology, platforms and analytics; and (iii) improvement of business efficiencies through operating model changes, including those relating to the Group's central, asset management and investment oversight functions. Further detail on the risks to the Group associated with large-scale transformation and complex strategic initiatives is included in section 3.1 of the Risk factors.\n\nThe Group aims to ensure that, for both transformation and strategic initiatives, strong programme governance is in place with embedded risk expertise to achieve ongoing and nimble risk oversight, with regular risk monitoring and reporting to risk committees. The Group's Transformation Risk Framework is in place alongside the Group's existing risk policies and frameworks with the aim to ensure appropriate governance and controls are in place to mitigate these risks. The Group also enhanced its governance framework in 2023 to better oversee the implementation and risk management of digital platforms. This includes the establishment of digital governance forums that oversee digital transformation from various dimensions such as customer-centricity, strategic, financial, operational and risk management. In addition, Prudential is continuously enhancing strategic capabilities through internal talent development and talent acquisition.  Developing an engaged workforce that provides adequate resources for our people to manage change, connect, grow and succeed is one of the priorities for the company.\n\nAlongside the Non-Financial Risk Appetite Framework, other risk policies and standards are in place that individually engage with specific non-financial risks, including operations processes, change management, third-party and outsourcing management, business continuity, fraud, financial crime as well as information security, IT infrastructure and data privacy. These policies and standards include subject matter expert-led processes that are designed to identify, assess, manage and control non-financial risks, including:\n\n- - Reviews of key non-financial risks and challenges within Group and business units' business plans during the annual planning cycle, to support business decisions;\n- - Corporate insurance programmes to limit the financial impact of operational risks;\n- - Oversight of risk management during the transformation life cycle, project prioritisation and the risks, interdependencies and possible conflicts arising from a large portfolio of transformation activities;\n- - Screening and transaction monitoring systems for financial crime and a programme of compliance control monitoring reviews and regular risk assessments;\n- - Internal and external review of cyber security capability and defences;\n- - Regular updating and risk-based testing of disaster recovery plans and the Critical Incident Procedure process;\n- - Established processes to deliver the highest quality of service to fulfil customers' needs and expectations; and\n- - Active engagement in and monitoring of regulatory developments.\n\nThe Group aims to manage the risk effectively by maintaining operational resilience and honouring commitments to customers and stakeholders, whilst avoiding material adverse financial loss or impact on its reputation. Further detail on the risks to the Group arising from system issues or control gaps is included in sections 3.1 and 3.3 in the Risk factors.",

This aims to  ensure that appropriate contract performance and risk mitigation  measures are in place over these arrangements. In addition, the Group  Third-Party Risk Oversight Framework is in place to set out the Group's  third-party risk management and oversight standards that guide the  Group senior management and RCS function to oversee, challenge and  manage the Group's third-party risk profile in a consistent and  coherent way.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Model risk Model risk is the risk of adverse financial, regulatory,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The Group has no appetite for model or UDA related incidents leading  to regulatory breaches.

Further detail on the risks to the Group associated with operating in high-risk markets is included in section 3.6 of the Risk factors.\n\n## Information security, IT infrastructure and data privacy risks\n\nRisks related to malicious attacks on Prudential systems, service disruption, exfiltration of data, loss of data integrity and the impact on the privacy of our customer data remain prevalent, particularly as the accessibility of attacking tools available to potential adversaries increases. Regulatory developments in cyber security and data protection are progressing worldwide and may increase the complexity of requirements and obligations required for companies. Further detail on the risks to the Group associated with operating in high-risk markets is included in sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Risk factors.\n\nThe Group-wide policies on anti-money laundering, sanctions and antibribery and corruption risks reflect the requirements applicable to all staff in all offices and businesses. Screening and transaction monitoring systems are in place across the Group.\n\nThe Group has continued to strengthen and enhance its financial crime risk management capability through investment in advanced analytics and AI tools. Proactive detective capabilities are being implemented across the Group and delivered through a centralised monitoring hub to further strengthen oversight of financial crime risks in the areas of procurement and third-party management. Risk assessments are performed annually for businesses and offices across all locations. Due diligence reviews and assessments against the Group's financial crime policies are performed as part of the Group's business acquisition process.\n\nThe Group adheres to data minimisation and 'privacy-by-design' principles, where data is only collected and used for its intended purpose and is not retained longer than necessary. The handling of customers' data is governed by specific policies and frameworks, such as the Group Information Security Policy, the Group Privacy Policy and the Group Data Policy, to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and the ethical use of customer data.\n\nDespite the rise in ransomware activity due to the availability of ransomware exploit toolkits and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) for threat actors, the Group has a number of defences in place to protect its systems from cyber security attacks.  Prudential has adopted a holistic risk management approach which is designed to prevent and disrupt potential attacks against the Group as well as third-party partner systems and to manage the recovery process should an attack take place. Other defences include, but are not limited to: (i) distributed denial of services (DDoS) protection for the Group's websites via web application firewall services; (ii) AI-based endpoint security software; (iii) continuous security monitoring; (iv) network-based intrusion detection; and (v) employee training and awareness campaigns to raise understanding of attacks utilising email phishing techniques. Cyber insurance coverage is in place to provide some protection against potential financial losses, and the cyber attack simulation exercises have been carried out to enhance preparedness. The Group has also established various processes to ensure the effectiveness of information security and privacy mechanisms deployed, which include setting up a dedicated ethical hacking team to perform testing on the Group's systems to identify potential vulnerabilities, engaging external consultants to perform penetration testing on our systems, and engaging external consultants to perform independent assessments on both security operations centre and the information and privacy function as a whole to further improve the efficiency of the functions. A private Bug Bounty Programme has also been established to provide a mechanism for invited external security practitioners to report security issues and vulnerabilities. This is further supported by a Vulnerability Disclosure Programme that allows independent security researchers to report security issues and vulnerabilities via the Prudential websites.\n\nThe Group has subscribed to services from independent security consultants to continuously monitor our external security posture. As the Group continues to develop and expand digital services and emerging products, its reliance on third-party service providers and business partners who specialise in niche capabilities is also increasing. In 2023, among many companies around the world, the Group's businesses in Malaysia were affected by the global MOVEit data-theft attack, where a zero-day vulnerability was exploited at MOVEit, a software solution providing secured file transfer services, with infringements to data security, integrity and privacy.

The Group's Customer Conduct Risk Framework reflects management's focus on customer outcomes.\n\nFactors that may increase conduct risk can be found throughout the product life cycle, from the complexity of the Group's products and services to its diverse distribution channels, which include its agency workforce, virtual face-toface sales, and sales via online digital platforms.\n\n## Legal and regulatory compliance risk\n\nPrudential operates in highly regulated markets and under the ever-evolving requirements and expectations of diverse and dynamic regulatory, legal and tax regimes which may impact its business or the way the business is conducted. The complexity of legal and regulatory (including sanctions) compliance continues to evolve and increase, representing a challenge for international businesses. Compliance with the Group's legal or regulatory obligations (including in respect of international sanctions) in one jurisdiction may conflict with the law or policy objectives of another jurisdiction or may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives of one jurisdiction over another, creating additional legal, regulatory compliance and reputational risks. These risks may be increased where the scope of regulatory requirements and obligations are uncertain, and where specific cases applicable to the Group are complex. In certain jurisdictions in which Prudential operates there are several ongoing policy initiatives and regulatory developments which will impact the way Prudential is supervised. Further information on specific areas of regulatory and supervisory focus and changes are included in section 4 of the Risk factors.\n\nThe Group has developed a Group Customer Conduct Risk Policy which sets out five customer conduct standards that the business is expected to meet, being:\n\n- - Treat customers fairly, honestly and with integrity;\n- - Provide and promote products and services that meet customer needs, are clearly explained and that deliver real value;\n- - Manage customer information appropriately, and maintain the confidentiality of customer information;\n- - Provide and promote high standards of customer service; and\n- - Act fairly and promptly to address customer complaints and any errors found.\n\nConduct risk is managed via a range of controls that are assessed through the Group's Conduct Risk Assessment Framework, reviewed within its monitoring programmes, and overseen within reporting to its boards and committees.\n\nManagement of the Group's conduct risk is key to the Group's strategy. Prudential's conduct risks are managed and mitigated using the following, among other tools:\n\n- - The Group's Code of Conduct and conduct standards, product underwriting and other related risk policies, and supporting controls including the Group's fraud risk control programme;\n- - A culture that supports the fair treatment of the customer, incentivises the right behaviour through proper remuneration structures, and provides a safe environment to report conduct risk-related issues via the Group's internal processes and the Speak Out programme;\n- - Distribution controls, including monitoring programmes relevant to the type of business (insurance or asset management), distribution channel (agency, bancassurance or digital) and ecosystem, to help ensure sales are conducted in a manner that considers the fair treatment of customers within digital environments;\n- - Quality of sales processes, services and training, and use of other initiatives such as special requirements for vulnerable customers, to improve customer outcomes;\n- - Appropriate claims management and complaint handling practices; and\n- - Regular deep dive assessments on, and monitoring of, conduct risks and periodic conduct risk assessments.\n\nRegulatory developments are monitored by the Group at a national and global level and these considerations form part of the Group's ongoing engagement with government policy teams, industry groups and regulators.\n\nRisk management and mitigation of regulatory risk at Prudential includes a comprehensive set of compliance and financial crime operating arrangements, such as policies, procedures, reporting protocols, risk management measures, disclosures and training, to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory and legal obligations. Appropriate controls or tools have been systematically integrated into the daily operations of Prudential:\n\n- - Close monitoring and assessment of our business controls and regulatory landscape, with explicit compliance consideration of risk themes in strategic decisions and cross-border activities including payments;\n- - Ongoing engagement with national regulators, government policy teams and international standard setters; and\n- - Compliance oversight to ensure adherence to new regulatory developments, including those associated with greenwashing risk.",

The profitability of the Group's businesses depends on a mix of factors including levels of, and trends in, mortality (policyholders dying), morbidity (policyholders becoming ill or suffering an accident) and policyholder behaviour (variability in how customers interact with their policies, including utilisation of withdrawals, take-up of options and guarantees and persistency, ie lapsing/surrendering of policies), and increases in the costs of claims over time (claim inflation). The risks associated with adverse experience relative to assumptions associated with product performance and customer behavior are detailed in section 3.7 of the Risk factors. The Group has appetite for retaining insurance risks in the areas where it believes it has expertise and operational controls to manage the risk and where it judges it to be more valuecreating to do so rather than transferring the risk, and only to the extent that these risks remain part of a balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and are compatible with a robust solvency position.\n\nInflationary and other economic pressures have also impacted morbidity experience in several markets. Elevated interest rates may lead customers to lapse in preference for alternate saving options that offer higher levels of guarantees. A high-inflation environment, and the broader economic effects of recessionary concerns, may also increase lapses, surrenders and fraud, as well as heighten premium affordability challenges.\n\nThe principal drivers of the Group's insurance risk vary across its business units. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, a significant volume of health and protection business is written, and the most significant insurance risks are medical claims inflation risk, morbidity risk and persistency risk.\n\n## Medical claims inflation risk\n\nA key assumption in these markets is the rate of medical claims inflation, which is often in excess of general price inflation. The cost of medical treatment could increase more than expected, resulting in higher than anticipated medical claims cost passed on to Prudential.\n\n## Morbidity risk\n\nMorbidity risk is the risk of deviations in the future frequency and magnitude of non-fatal accident and sickness claims relative to initial assumptions that are adverse to shareholder value. It can be influenced by a range of factors including: inflationary, economic and other pressures on the cost of medical treatment; medical advances which can reduce the incidence and improve recovery rates of serious health conditions but can also increase diagnosis rates and/ or increase treatment costs of certain conditions; government and regulatory policies; opportunistic activities (including fraud); and natural events (including pandemics). Morbidity risk can also result from: product design features that incentivise adverse policyholder behaviour; inappropriate or insufficiently informed initial assumptions; claims volatility due to random fluctuation or a large-scale systemic event; insufficient recognition of an individual's medical; financial and/or and other relevant circumstances during the policy application assessment process; and/or ineffective claims assessments leading to payment of claims that are inconsistent with the insurance product's contract and/or best practice.\n\nInsurance risks are managed and mitigated using the following, among other methods:\n\n- - The Group's Insurance Policy;\n- - The Group's Product and Underwriting Risk Policy, which sets out the required standards for effective product and underwriting risk management and approvals for new, or changes to existing, products (including the role of the Group), and the processes to enable the measurement of underwriting risk. The policy also describes how the Group's Customer Conduct Risk Policy is met in relation to new product approvals and current and legacy products;\n- - The Group's Counter Fraud Policy (see the 'Fraud risk' section above);\n- - Using persistency, morbidity and longevity assumptions that reflect recent experience and expectation of future trends, and the use of industry data and expert judgement where appropriate;\n- - Using reinsurance to mitigate mortality and morbidity risks;\n- - Ensuring appropriate medical underwriting when policies are issued and appropriate claims management practices when claims are received in order to mitigate morbidity risk;\n- - Maintaining the quality of sales processes and training, and using initiatives to increase customer retention in order to mitigate persistency risk;\n- - The use of mystery shopping to identify opportunities for improvement in sales processes and training; and\n- - Using product repricing and other claims management initiatives in order to mitigate morbidity and medical claims inflation risk.\n\nThis risk is best managed by retaining the right to reprice products and appropriate overall claims limits within policies, either per type of medical treatment or in total across a policy, annually and/or over the policy lifetime. Medical reimbursement downgrade experience (where the policyholder reduces the level of the coverage/protection in order to reduce premium payments) following any repricing is also monitored by the Group's businesses.\n\nMorbidity risk is managed through prudent product design, underwriting and claims management, and for certain products, the right to reprice where appropriate. Prudential's morbidity assumptions reflect its recent experience and expectation of future trends for each relevant line of business.",

        "page_content": "## Insurance risks continued\n\n## Persistency risk\n\nPersistency risk results from adverse changes in policy surrenders, paid-ups and other policy discontinuances. In general, lower persistency experience results in deterioration of profits and shareholder value and can be an indicator of inadequate sales quality controls, and can elevate conduct, reputational and regulatory risks.  Persistency risk generally stems from misalignment between customer needs and purchased product as a result of insufficient product collaterals and/or sales process, insufficient post-sale communication and engagement with the customer leading to a deterioration of appreciation of the value of their policy, operational barriers to premium renewal payment, and/or changes in policyholder circumstances resulting from external drivers.\n\nPersistency risk is managed by appropriate controls across the product life cycle. These include: review and revisions to product design and incentive structures where required; ensuring appropriate training and sales processes, including those ensuring active customer engagement and high service quality; appropriate customer disclosures and product collaterals; use of customer retention initiatives; and post-sale management through regular experience monitoring. Strong risk management and mitigation of conduct risk and the identification of common characteristics of business with high lapse rates is also crucial. Where appropriate, allowance is made for the relationship (either assumed or observed historically) between persistency and investment returns. Modelling this dynamic policyholder behaviour is particularly important when assessing the likely take-up rate of options embedded within certain products.\n\n## Business concentration risk\n\nPrudential operates in markets in both Asia and Africa via various channels and product mix; although largely diversified at the Group level, several of these markets are exposed to certain levels of concentration risk. From a channel concentration perspective, some of the Group's key markets rely on agency and some markets rely on bancassurance. From a product concentration perspective, some of the Group's markets focus heavily on specific product types, depending on the target customer segments. Geographically, the Greater China (Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan) region contributes materially to the Group's top and bottom lines. Uncertainties in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions as well as regulatory changes may elevate business concentration risk including any potential slowdown in business from Mainland Chinese visitors and in the Chinese Mainland, and adversely impact the Group's business and financial condition.\n\nTo improve business resilience, the Group continues to look for opportunities to enhance business diversification by building multimarket growth engines as part of its strategy.\n\n## Risks associated with the oversight of the Group's joint ventures and associates\n\nPrudential operates, and in certain markets is required by local regulation to operate, through joint ventures and other joint ownership or associates. For such operations, the level of control exercisable by the Group depends on the terms of the contractual agreements between participants. Whilst the joint ventures and associates are run as separate entities, the Group's interests are best safeguarded by our ability to effectively oversee and influence these joint venture and associates in a way that is proportionate to our ownership level and control. Further information on the risks to the Group associated with its joint ventures and other shareholders and third parties are included in section 3.6 of the Risk factors.\n\nThe Group exercises primary oversight and control over joint ventures and associates through our nominated directors and other representatives on the Board and Board Committees, whose appointments are subject to regular review. The Group has effective access to management information on these businesses via the Board and Board Committees, the businesses' public disclosures, and established regular touchpoints with key business functions of these organisations (eg audit). Key updates on joint ventures and associates are provided to the Group's governance such as the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.",

As such, Prudential considers that its purpose aligns closely with important societal needs, including increasing access to health and financial protection, enabling a just and inclusive transition to a low-carbon future and paving the way to long-term resilience for our customers, people, communities and investors. Prudential is focused on addressing these increasing needs, reflecting population demographics in our chosen markets.\n\nThe drivers for this structural growth, such as the low levels of insurance cover, need for protection and rising wealth in our markets, are discussed on pages 14 to 15, alongside the actions we have taken to deliver our objectives and enhance our capabilities. In undertaking these activities, we aim both to meet the evolving needs of our customers and provide sustainable growth for our shareholders, which will support the viability of our business over the longer term.\n\nDuring 2023, consumer demand in Asia remained resilient as reflected in overall growth in the business, although there was variation across markets. This underscores the strength of our multimarket growth engine backed by our diversified channel mix, which is key to driving sustainable value in the long term. Over the longer term, we believe that the demand for our products will continue to grow in line with the structural growth in our chosen markets.\n\nAll of the Group's activities are underpinned by ongoing risk management, implemented via the Group Risk Framework and risk appetite limits described in the Group risk review on pages 56 to 58. The Group as a whole and each of its life assurance operations are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which are designed primarily to reinforce the Group's management of its long-term solvency, liquidity and viability to ensure that it can continue to meet obligations to policyholders. Further details on the current capital strength of the Group are provided on pages 367 to 370.\n\nThe Group's management of wider environmental, social and governance issues that could pose a risk to the Group in the future, including the impact of climate change, is set out in the Sustainability section on pages 97 to 149.\n\nThis risk and regulatory focus supports the sustainability of our business over the longer term.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nThe Directors have assessed the viability of the Group for a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern statement.\n\nThe Directors performed the assessment by reference to the threeyear plan period to 31 December 2026. Three years is considered an appropriate period as this is the period over which the Group undertakes stress testing for the key economic and insurance risk factors which most directly affect the viability of the Group. A period of three years is selected as these forecasts are inherently volatile over a longer estimation period. This period also represents the period covered by the detailed business plan that is prepared annually on a rolling three-year basis. In approving the business plan, the Directors reviewed the Group's projected performance with regard to profitability, cash generation and capital position, together with the parent company's liquidity over this three-year period. Assumptions applied in the plan include foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity growth rates and economic growth rates. The Directors are satisfied that this period is sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of viability to be made.\n\n## Assessment of principal risks over the period\n\nThe Group's business plan implements the Group's strategic objectives through the pillars, enablers and business model discussed on pages 24 to 29. Assessment of the risks to achieving the projected performance remains an integral part of the planning process. The Group's approach to risk management and a summary of the key risks facing the Group are set out on pages 56 to 71.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors considered those risks where the impact of possible adverse external developments could be of such speed and severity as to present a shock to the Group's financial position. While all the risks set out in the Risk review have the potential to impact the Group's performance, the key risks impacting the Group's viability are: market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and regulatory risk. The Directors also considered geo-political and technology risk and the potential impact of the macroeconomic environment in the markets in which the Group operates. Mitigation in place for these key risks to viability is set out on pages 59 to 62 and 66 to 68.",

        "page_content": "## Stress and scenario testing\n\nAs noted above, underpinning the projections in the business plan are a number of economic and other assumptions. To evaluate the Group's resilience to significant deteriorations in market and credit conditions and other shock events, these risks are grouped together into scenarios which are then applied to the assumptions underlying the business plans. Stresses have been applied to the economic and non-economic assumptions underlying the base case business plan, reflecting the Group's management of its position within its risk appetite. The stresses applied to our economic plan and other assumptions in two adverse economic scenarios were as below:\n\n|                    | Interest rate stress 6   | Equity stress 6   | Property  stress   | Corporate credit  spread increase   | Credit default/ downgrade   | Adverse currency  movement 6   | Adverse expense  (unit cost)   | Other stress                     |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Global stagflation | +75bps to +200bps        | (20)% to  (25)%   | (10)%              | +50bps                              | 3 times base  assumption    | (5)% to  (10)%                 | +5%                            | Adverse  policyholder  behaviour |\n| Geopolitical risk  | (100)bps  to  +200bps    | (20)% to (40)%    | (10)%              | +100bps to  +130bps 6               | 3 times base  assumption    | (5)% to  (20)%                 | +10%                           | Adverse  policyholder  behaviour |\n\nThe sensitivity of the Group's regulatory solvency at 31 December 2023 to changes in key assumptions is set out on pages 367 to 368 of this Annual Report. In addition, the adequacy of liquid resources of the Group's parent company across the plan period has been assessed by considering a stress scenario assuming the closure of short-term debt markets, as well as additional calls on central liquidity by the local businesses. In this liquidity stress scenario, the Group would have access to sufficient resources to meet the funding requirements of the business, after taking into account the Group's undrawn committed liquidity facilities of $1.6 billion in place from 15 February 2024, which replaced the $2.6 billion facilities in place at 31 December 2023, on top of central cash and short-term investment balances, which as at 31 December 2023 were $3.5 billion.\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the Group would be able to maintain viability over the three-year period under assessment, after taking account of the actions available to management to mitigate the impacts on capital and liquidity in such scenarios. These actions include, but are not limited to, rebalancing investment portfolios, increased use of reinsurance and repricing of in-force benefits. In addition, the Group conducts an annual reverse stress test which gives the Directors an understanding of the maximum resilience of the Group to extremely severe adverse scenarios. The analysis assists in identifying management actions that could be implemented to restore the Group's capital and liquidity resources from extreme positions. This analysis also informs the Group's recovery plan and liquidity risk management plan.\n\nThe impact on the business of known areas of regulatory change whose financial implications can be reasonably quantified is also considered as part of the plan. As well as known areas of regulatory change, the Group is exposed to the risk of sudden and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements at the Group and local levels. While unexpected changes cannot be fully anticipated and hence modelled, the risk of regulatory change is mitigated by capital held by the Group and its subsidiaries in excess of Group and local regulatory requirements, the Group and its subsidiaries' ability to generate significant capital annually through operational delivery and the availability of compensating actions designed to restore key capital metrics.\n\n## Conclusion on viability\n\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year plan period to December 2026.\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Reflecting products that are classified as Variable Fee Approach only.\n- (2) With the exception of investments backing the shareholders' 10 per cent share of the estate within the Hong Kong participating fund\n- (3) Excluding assets held to cover linked liabilities and those of the consolidated investment funds.\n- (4) Based on middle ranking from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch.

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## Risk factors\n\nA number of risk factors may affect the financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects of Prudential and its wholly and jointly owned businesses, as a whole, and, accordingly, the trading price of Prudential's shares. The risk factors mentioned below should not be regarded as a complete, exhaustive and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The information given is as of the date of this document, and any forward-looking statements are made subject to the factors specified under 'Forward-looking statements'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risks relating to Prudential's financial situation\n\n## 1.1 Prudential's businesses are inherently subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions, each of which may adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nUncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in global and national macroeconomic conditions and investment climates could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of increased strategic, business, insurance, product and customer conduct risks.\n\nGlobal financial markets are subject to uncertainty and volatility created by a variety of factors. Examples of these factors include: actual or expected changes in both monetary and regulatory policies in the Chinese Mainland, the US and other jurisdictions together with their impact on base interest rates and the valuation of all asset classes and inflation expectations; slowdowns or reversals in world or regional economic growth from geopolitical conflicts and/or global issues such as pandemics, etc.; and sector-specific, for examples in banking, real estate, etc., slowdowns or deteriorations which have the potential to have contagion impacts. Other factors include fluctuations in global commodity and energy prices, concerns over the serviceability of sovereign debt in certain economies, the increased level of geopolitical and political risk and policy-related uncertainty, socio-political and climate-driven events, etc. The transition to a lower carbon economy, the timing and speed of which is uncertain and will vary by country, may also result in greater uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in asset valuations and reduced liquidity, particularly for carbon-intensive sectors, and may have a bearing on inflation levels. The extent of the financial market and economic impact of these factors may be highly uncertain and unpredictable and influenced by the actions, including the duration and effectiveness of mitigating measures by governments, policymakers and the public.\n\nThe adverse effects of such factors could be felt principally through the following items:\n\n- -Changes to interest rates could reduce Prudential's capital strength and impair its ability to write significant volumes of new business. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the financial condition of the Group through changes in the present value of future fees for unit-linked businesses and/or the present value of future profits for accident and health products; and/or reduce the value of the Group's assets and/or have a negative impact on its assets under management and profit. Decreases in interest rates could: increase the potential adverse impact of product guarantees included in non-unit-linked products with a savings component; reduce investment returns on the Group's portfolios; impact the valuation of debt securities; and/or increase reinvestment risk for some of the Group's investments from accelerated prepayments and increased redemptions.\n\n- -A reduction in the financial strength and flexibility of corporate entities may result in a deterioration of the credit rating profile and valuation of the Group's invested credit portfolio (which may lead to an increase in regulatory capital requirements for the Group or its businesses), increased credit defaults and debt restructurings and wider credit and liquidity spreads, resulting in realised and unrealised credit losses. Regulations imposing or increasing restrictions on the amount of company debt financing, such as those placing limits on debt or liability ratios, may also reduce the financial flexibility of corporate entities. Similarly, securitised assets in the Group's investment portfolio are subject to default risk and may be adversely impacted by delays or failures of borrowers to make payments of principal and interest when due. Where a widespread deterioration in the financial strength of corporate entities occurs, any assumptions on the ability and willingness of governments to provide financial support may need to be revised.\n- -Failure of Prudential's counterparties (such as banks, reinsurers and counterparties to cash management and risk transfer or hedging transactions) to meet commitments, or legal, regulatory or reputational restrictions on the Group's ability to deal with these counterparties, could give rise to a negative impact on Prudential's financial position and on the accessibility or recoverability of amounts due or the adequacy of collateral. Geographic or sector concentrations of counterparty credit risk could exacerbate the impact of these events where they materialise.\n- -Estimates of the value of financial instruments becoming more difficult because in certain illiquid, volatile or closed markets, determining the value at which financial instruments can be realised is highly subjective. Processes to ascertain such values require substantial elements of judgement, assumptions and estimates (which may change over time). Where the Group is required to sell its investments within a defined time frame, such market conditions may result in the sale of these investments at below expected or recorded prices.\n- -Illiquidity of the Group's investments. The Group holds certain investments that may, by their nature, lack liquidity or have the potential to lose liquidity rapidly, such as investment funds (including money market funds), privately placed fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, complex structured securities and alternative investments. If these investments were required to be liquidated on short notice, the Group could experience difficulty in doing so and could be forced to sell them at a lower price than it otherwise would have been able to realise.",

        "page_content": "- -A reduction in revenue from the Group's products where fee income is linked to account values or the market value of the funds under management. Sustained inflationary pressures which may drive higher interest rates may also impact the valuation of fixed income investments and reduce fee income.\n- - Increased illiquidity, which includes the risk that expected cash inflows from investments and operations will not be adequate to meet the Group's anticipated short-term and long-term policyholder benefits and expense payment obligations. Increased illiquidity also adds to the uncertainty over the accessibility of financial resources which in extreme conditions could impact the functioning of markets and reduce capital resources as valuations decline. This could occur if external capital is unavailable at sustainable cost, increased liquid assets are required to be held as collateral under derivative transactions or redemption restrictions are placed on Prudential's investments in illiquid funds. In addition, significant redemption requests could also be made on Prudential's issued funds and while this may not have a direct impact on the Group's liquidity, it could result in reputational damage to Prudential. The potential impact of increased illiquidity is more uncertain than for other risks such as interest rate or credit risk.\n\nFor some non-unit-linked products with a savings component it may not be possible to hold assets which will provide cash flows to match those relating to policyholder liabilities. This may particularly be the case in those markets where bond markets are less developed or where the duration of policyholder liabilities is longer than the duration of bonds issued and available in the market, and in certain markets where regulated premium and claim values are set with reference to the interest rate environment prevailing at the time of policy issue. This results in a mismatch due to the duration and uncertainty of the liability cash flows and the lack of sufficient assets of a suitable duration. While this residual asset/liability mismatch risk can be managed, it cannot be eliminated. If interest rates in these markets are lower than those used to calculate premium and claim values over a sustained period, this could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's reported profit and the solvency of its business units. In addition, part of the profit from the Group's operations is related to bonuses for policyholders declared on participating\n\nproducts, which are impacted by the difference between actual investment returns of the participating fund (which are broadly based on historical and current rates of return on equity, real estate and fixed income securities) and minimum guarantee rates offered to policyholders. This profit could be lower in particular in a sustained low interest rate environment.\n\nIn general, upheavals in the financial markets may affect general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behaviour. As a result, insurers may experience an elevated incidence of claims, frauds, lapses, partial withdrawals or surrenders of policies, and some policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans. Uncertainty over livelihoods, elevated cost of living and challenges in affordability may adversely impact the demand for insurance products and increase regulatory risk in meeting regulatory definitions and expectations with respect to vulnerable customers (see risk factor 3.7). In addition, there may be a higher incidence of counterparty failures. If sustained, this environment is likely to have a negative impact on the insurance sector over time and may consequently have a negative impact on Prudential's business, balance sheet and profitability. For example, this could occur if the recoverable value of intangible assets for bancassurance agreements is reduced. New challenges related to market fluctuations and general economic conditions may continue to emerge. For example, sustained inflationary pressures driving interest rates to even higher levels may lead to increased lapses for some guaranteed savings products where higher levels of guarantees are offered by products of the Group's competitors, reflecting consumer demand for returns at the level of, or exceeding, inflation. High inflation, combined with an economic downturn or recession, may also result in affordability challenges, adversely impacting the ability of consumers to purchase insurance products. Rising inflation, via medical claims inflation (with rising medical import prices a factor under current market conditions), may adversely impact the profitability of the Group's businesses.\n\nAny of the foregoing factors and events, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 1.2 Geopolitical and political risks and uncertainty may adversely impact economic conditions, increase market volatility and regulatory compliance risks, cause operational disruption to the Group and impact the implementation of its strategic plans, which could have adverse effects on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe Group is exposed to geopolitical and political risks and uncertainty in the diverse markets in which it operates. Such risks may include:\n\n- -The application of government regulations, executive powers, sanctions, protectionist or restrictive economic and trade policies or measures adopted by businesses or industries which increase trade barriers or restrict trade, sales, financial transactions, or the transfer of capital, investment, data or other intellectual property, with respect to specific territories, markets, companies or individuals;\n- - An increase in the volume and pace of domestic regulatory changes, including those applying to specific sectors;\n- - The increased adoption or implementation of laws and regulations which may purport to have extra-territorial application;\n- - An increase in military tensions, regional hostilities or new conflicts which may disrupt business operations, investments and growth;\n- -Withdrawals or expulsions from existing trading blocs or agreements or financial transaction systems, or fragmentation of systems, including those which facilitate cross-border payments;\n- - The implementation of measures favouring local enterprises including changes to the maximum level of non-domestic ownership by foreign companies, differing treatment of foreignowned businesses under regulations and tax rules, or international trade disputes affecting foreign companies;\n- - Increased costs due to government mandates or regulations imposing a financial contribution to the government as a condition for doing business; and\n- - Measures which require businesses of overseas companies to operate through locally incorporated entities or with requirements on minimum local representation on executive or management committees.",

        "page_content": "Risk factors continued\n\nThe above risks may have an adverse impact on Prudential through their effects on the macroeconomic outlook and the environment for global, regional and national financial markets. Prudential may also face heightened sanction risks driven by geopolitical conflicts as well as increased reputational risks. The above risks may also adversely impact the economic, business, legal and regulatory environment in specific markets or territories in which the Group, its joint ventures or jointly owned businesses, sales and distribution networks, or thirdparty service providers have operations. For internationally active groups such as Prudential, operating across multiple jurisdictions, such measures may also add to the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance and increase the risk of conflicts between the requirements of one jurisdiction and another. See risk factor 4.1 below.\n\nGeopolitical and political risks and uncertainty may also adversely impact the Group's operations and its operational resilience. Increasing geopolitical and political tensions may lead to conflict, civil unrest and/or disobedience as well as increases in domestic and crossborder cyber intrusion activity. Such events could impact operational resilience by disrupting Prudential's systems, operations, new business sales and renewals, distribution channels and services to customers, which may result in a reduction in contributions from business units to the central cash balances and profit of the Group, decreased profitability, financial loss, adverse customer impacts and reputational damage and may impact Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nLegislative or regulatory changes and geopolitical or political risks which adversely impact Hong Kong's international trading and economic relationships may result in adverse sales, operational and product distribution impacts to the Group due to the territory being a key market which also hosts Group head office functions.\n\n## 1.3 As a holding company, Prudential is dependent upon its subsidiaries to cover operating expenses and dividend payments.\n\nThe Group's insurance and asset management operations are generally conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries, which are subject to the risks discussed elsewhere in this 'Risk factors' section.\n\nAs a holding company, Prudential's principal sources of funds are remittances from subsidiaries, shareholder-backed funds, the shareholder transfer from long-term funds and any amounts that may be raised through the issuance of equity, debt and commercial paper.\n\nCertain of Prudential's subsidiaries are subjected to insurance, asset management, foreign exchange and tax laws, rules and regulations (including in relation to distributable profits that can limit their ability to make remittances). In some circumstances, including where there are changes to general market conditions, this could limit Prudential's ability to pay dividends to shareholders or to make available funds held in certain subsidiaries to cover the operating expenses of other members of the Group.\n\nA material change in the financial condition of any of Prudential's subsidiaries may have a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 1.4 Prudential's investment portfolio is subject to the risk of potential sovereign debt credit deterioration.\n\nInvesting in sovereign debt creates exposure to the direct or indirect consequences of geopolitical or political, social or economic changes (including changes in governments, heads of state or monarchs), military conflicts, pandemics and associated disruption, and other events affecting the markets in which the issuers of such debt are located and the creditworthiness of the sovereign. Investment in sovereign debt obligations involves risks that are different to investment in the debt obligations of corporate issuers. In addition, the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due (or in their agreed currency) in accordance with the terms of such debt, and Prudential may have limited recourse to compel payment in the event of a default. A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal and to pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its financial position, the extent and availability of its foreign currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole, the sovereign debtor's policy toward local and international lenders, geopolitical tensions and conflicts and the political constraints to which the sovereign debtor may be subject.\n\nMoreover, governments may use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by their central banks or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to devalue their currencies' exchange rates, or may adopt monetary, fiscal and other policies (including to manage their debt burdens) that have a similar effect, all of which could adversely impact the value of an investment in sovereign debt even in the absence of a technical default. Periods of economic uncertainty may affect the volatility of market prices of sovereign debt to a greater extent than the volatility inherent in debt obligations of other types of issuers.\n\nIn addition, if a sovereign default or other such events described above were to occur, as has happened on certain occasions in the past, other financial institutions may also suffer losses or experience solvency or other concerns, which may result in Prudential facing additional risks relating to investments in such financial institutions that are held in the Group's investment portfolio. There is also risk that public perceptions about the stability and creditworthiness of financial institutions and the financial sector generally might be adversely affected, as might counterparty relationships between financial institutions.\n\nIf a sovereign were to default on or restructure its obligations, or adopt policies that devalued or otherwise altered the currencies in which its obligations were denominated, this could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

Downgrades in Prudential's ratings as a result of, for example, decreased profitability, increased costs, increased indebtedness or other concerns could have an adverse effect on its ability to market products, retain current policyholders and attract new policyholders, as well as the Group's ability to compete for acquisition and strategic opportunities. Downgrades could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial flexibility, including its ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable levels and pricing, requirements to post collateral under or in connection with transactions, and ability to manage market risk exposures. The interest rates at which Prudential is able to borrow funds are affected by its credit ratings, which are in place to measure the Group's ability to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nIn addition, changes in methodologies and criteria used by rating agencies could result in downgrades that do not reflect changes in the general economic conditions or Prudential's financial condition.\n\nIn addition, any such downgrades could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Prudential cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions Prudential may take in response to any such actions, which could adversely affect its business.\n\n## 1.6 Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations owing to the geographical diversity of its businesses.\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of Prudential's businesses, Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Prudential's operations generally write policies and invest in assets denominated in local currencies, but in some markets, Prudential also writes policies and invests in assets denominated in non-local currencies, primarily in the US dollar. Although this practice limits the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on local operating results, it can lead to fluctuations in Prudential's consolidated financial statements upon the translation of results into the Group's presentation currency. This exposure is not currently separately managed. The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars. The results of some entities within the Group are not denominated in or\n\nlinked to the US dollar and some enter into transactions which are conducted in non-US dollar currencies. Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations from the translation of the results of these entities and non-US dollar transactions and the risks from the maintenance of the HK dollar peg to the US dollar. In cases where a non-US dollar denominated surplus arises in an operation which is to be used to support Group capital or shareholders' interest (ie remittances), this currency exposure may be hedged where considered economically favourable. Prudential is also subject to the residual risks arising from currency swaps and other derivatives that are used to manage the currency exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risks relating to sustainability (including environmental, social and governance (ESG) and climate-related) matters\n\n2.1 The failure to understand and respond effectively to the risks associated with sustainability factors could adversely affect Prudential's achievement of its long -term strategy.\n\nA failure to manage the material risks associated with key sustainability themes, including those detailed below, may inhibit the Group's ability to meet its sustainability-related commitments and undermine its sustainability credentials by adversely impacting the Group's reputation and brand, and its ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and therefore the results of its operations and delivery of its strategy and long-term financial success.\n\n## a Environmental risks\n\nEnvironmental concerns, notably those associated with climate change and its social and economic impacts, but also including those associated with biodiversity and nature degradation, present longterm risks to the sustainability of Prudential and may impact its customers and other stakeholders.\n\nPrudential's investment horizons are long term, and it is therefore exposed to the long-term impact of climate change risks, which include the financial and non-financial impact of the transition to a lower carbon economy, physical, reputational and shareholder, customer or third-party litigation risks. The global transition to a lower carbon economy may have an adverse impact on investment valuations and liquidity as the financial assets of carbon-intensive companies in some asset sectors re-price as a result of increased operating costs and a reduction in demand for their products and services. The speed of this transition, and the extent to which it is orderly and managed versus disorderly and reactive, will be influenced\n\nby factors such as changes in public policy, technology and market or investor sentiment. The potential impact of these factors on the valuation of investments may also have a broader economic impact that may adversely affect customers and their demand for the Group's products. Direct physical risks associated with the impacts of climate change combined with the potential economic impacts of the transition to a lower carbon economy have the potential to disproportionately impact the Asia and Africa markets in which Prudential operates and invests. The Group's stakeholders increasingly expect and/or rely on the Group to support an orderly, inclusive and sustainable transition based on an understanding of relevant market and company-level transition plans with consideration given to the impact on the economies, businesses, communities and customers in these markets.\n\nThe Group's ability to sufficiently understand and appropriately respond to transition risk and its ability to deliver on its external carbon reduction commitments and the implementation of sustainability considerations in existing or new sustainability or climate-orientated investment strategies and products may be limited by insufficient or unreliable data on carbon exposure, transition plans of the investee company assets in which it invests, or inability to divest as planned. The direct physical impacts of climate change, including shorter-term event-driven (acute) physical risks such as increasingly frequent and severe hurricanes and wildfires, and those associated with longer-term shifts in climate patterns such as",

Similarly, nature-related physical risks can impact life and health liabilities where, for example, pollution, poor water quality, waste contamination and overexploitation of the natural environment can all contribute to biodiversity degradation, which in turn can potentially pose threats to human health. Such short-term and longterm environmental changes in markets where Prudential or its key third parties operate could adversely impact the Group's operational resilience and its customers, which may potentially occur through migration or displacement both within and across borders.\n\nThe pace and volume of global standards and sustainability, environmental and climate-related regulations emerging across the markets in which the Group operates, the need to deliver on existing and new exclusions or restrictions on investments in certain sectors, engagement and reporting commitments and the demand for externally assured reporting may give rise to compliance, operational, disclosure and litigation risks which may be increased by the multijurisdictional coordination required in adopting a consistent risk management approach. The launch of sustainability-focused funds or products, or the (method of) incorporation of sustainability considerations within the investment process for existing products, may increase the risks related to the perceived fulfilment of fiduciary duties to customers and investors by the Group's appointed asset managers, and may subsequently increase regulatory compliance, customer conduct, product disclosure and litigation risks. Prudential's voluntary memberships of, or participation within, industry organisations and groups or their initiatives may increase stakeholder expectations of the Group's acquiescence or compliance with their publicised positions or aims. The reputational and litigation risks of the Group may subsequently increase where the stated positions or aims of such industry organisations or their initiatives continue to evolve, or where jurisdictions interpret their objectives as adversely impacting on markets or consumers, including for example, perceived conflicts with anti-trust laws. See risk factor 4.1 for details of sustainability including ESG and climate-related regulatory and supervisory developments with potential impacts for the Group.\n\nA failure to understand, manage and provide greater transparency of its exposure to these climate-related risks may have increasingly adverse implications for Prudential and its stakeholders.\n\n## b Social risks\n\nSocial risks that could impact Prudential may arise from a failure to consider the rights, diversity, wellbeing, changing needs, human rights and interests of its customers and employees and the communities in which the Group or its third parties operate. Perceived or actual inequity and income disparities (both within developed markets and within the Group's markets), intensified by the recent pandemic, have the potential to further erode social cohesion across the Group's markets which may increase operational and disruption risks for Prudential and impact the delivery of the Group's strategy on developing affordable and accessible products to meet the needs of people across these markets. Direct physical impacts of climate change and deterioration of the natural environment, together with the actions that support the global transition to a lower carbon economy, may disproportionately impact the stability of livelihoods and health of lower socioeconomic groups within the markets in which the Group operates. These risks are heightened as Prudential operates in multiple jurisdictions that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity degradation, with distinct local cultures and considerations.\n\nEvolving social norms and emerging population risks associated with public health trends (such as an increase in obesity and mental health deterioration) and demographic changes (such as population\n\nurbanisation and ageing), as well as potential migration due to factors including climate-related developments, may affect customer lifestyles and therefore may impact the level of claims under the Group's insurance product offerings.\n\nAs a provider of insurance and investment services, the Group is increasingly focused on making its products more accessible through the use of digital services, technologies and distribution methods to customers. As a result, Prudential has access to extensive amounts of customer personal data, including data related to personal health, and an increasing ability to analyse and interpret this data through the use of complex tools, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The Group is therefore exposed to an increase in technology risk, including potential unintended consequences from algorithmic bias, as well as regulatory, ethical and reputational risks associated with customer data misuse or security breaches. These risks are explained in risk factors 3.4 and 3.5 below. The increasing digitalisation of products, services and processes may also result in new and unforeseen regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, including those relating to how the Group supports its customers through this transformation.\n\nFailure to foster an inclusive, diverse and open environment for the Group's employees in accordance with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards could impact the ability to attract and/or retain employees and increase potential reputational risk. The business practices within the Group's third-party supply chain and investee companies with regards to topics including labour standards, respect of human rights and modern slavery also expose the Group to potential reputational risk.\n\n## c Governance\n\nA failure to maintain high standards of corporate governance may adversely impact the Group and its customers and employees and increase the risk of poor decision-making and a lack of oversight and management of its key risks. Poor governance may arise where key governance committees have insufficient independence, a lack of diversity, skills or experience in their members, or unclear (or insufficient) oversight responsibilities and mandates. Inadequate oversight over remuneration also increases the risk of poor senior management behaviours.\n\nPrudential operates across multiple jurisdictions and has a group and subsidiary governance structure which may add further complexity to these considerations. Participation in joint ventures or partnerships where Prudential does not have direct overall control and the use of third-party service providers increase the potential for reputational risks arising from inadequate governance.\n\nSustainability risks may directly or indirectly impact Prudential's business and the achievement of its strategic focus on providing greater and more accessible health and financial protection, responsible stewardship and investment within the Group's market to support a just and inclusive transition, developing a sustainable business that delivers a positive impact on its broad range of stakeholders, which range from customers, institutional investors, employees and suppliers, to policymakers, regulators, industry organisations and local communities. A failure to transparently and consistently implement the Group's Sustainability Strategy across its local businesses and operational, underwriting and investment activities, as well as a failure to implement and uphold responsible business practices, may adversely impact the financial condition and reputation of the Group. This may also negatively impact the Group's stakeholders, who all have expectations, concerns and aims related to sustainability matters, which may differ, both within and across stakeholder groups and the markets in which the Group operates. In its investment activities, Prudential's stakeholders increasingly have expectations of, and place reliance on, an approach to responsible",

These duties include effective implementation of exclusions, voting and active engagement decisions with respect to investee companies, as both an asset owner and an asset manager, in line with internally defined procedures and external commitments.\n\nThe increased demands and expectations of stakeholders for transparency and disclosure of the activities that support these duties further heightens disclosure risks for the Group, including those associated with potentially overstating or misstating the positive environmental or societal impacts of the Group's activities, products and services (eg greenwashing).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risks relating to Prudential's business activities and industry\n\n## 3.1 The implementation of large-scale transformation, including complex strategic initiatives, gives rise to significant design and execution risks and may affect Prudential's operational capability and capacity. Failure of these initiatives to meet their objectives may adversely impact the Group and the delivery of its strategy.\n\nWhere required in order to implement its business strategies for growth, meet customer needs, improve customer experiences, strengthen operational resilience, meet regulatory and industry requirements, and maintain market competitiveness, Prudential from time to time undertakes corporate restructuring, transformation programmes and acquisitions/disposals across its business. Many such change initiatives are complex, inter-connected and/or of large scale, and include improvement of business efficiencies through operating model changes, advancing the Group's digital capability, expanding strategic partnerships, and industry and regulatory-driven change. There may be a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, employees, customers, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if these initiatives incur unplanned costs, are subject to implementation delays, or fail to fully meet their objectives. Leadership changes and changes to the business and operational model of the Group increase uncertainty for its employees, which may affect operational capacity and the ability of the Group to deliver its strategy. There may also be adverse implications for the Group in undertaking transformation initiatives such as placing additional strain on employees or operational capacity, and weakening the\n\ncontrol environment. Implementing initiatives related to the revised strategy for the Group, control environment transformation, significant accounting standard changes, such as IFRS 17, and other regulatory changes in major businesses of the Group, such as those related to the agency transformation at the Indonesia businesses, may amplify these risks. Risks relating to these regulatory changes are explained in risk factor 4.1 below.\n\nThe speed of technological change in the business could outpace the Group's ability to anticipate all the unintended consequences that may arise from such change. Innovative technologies, such as AI, expose Prudential to potential additional regulatory, information security, privacy, operational, ethical and conduct risks.  Specifically, the increasing use of AI could lead to increased scrutiny from regulators, potential bias in decision-making processes, and unforeseen vulnerabilities in information security. The ethical implications of AI use, such as data privacy and transparency in automated decisions, are also potential areas of concern. If inadequately managed, these risks could result in customer detriment and reputational damage.\n\n## 3.2 Prudential's businesses are conducted in highly competitive environments with rapidly developing demographic trends. The profitability of the Group's businesses depends on management's ability to respond to these pressures and trends.\n\nThe markets for financial services are highly competitive, with a number of factors affecting Prudential's ability to sell its products and its profitability, including price and yields offered, financial strength and ratings, range of product lines and product quality, ability to implement and comply with regulatory changes, the imposition of regulatory sanctions, brand strength and name recognition, investment management performance and fund management trends, historical bonus levels, the ability to respond to developing demographic trends, customer appetite for certain savings products (which may be impacted by broader economic pressures), and technological advances. In some of its markets, Prudential faces competitors that are larger, have greater financial resources or a greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher bonus rates. Further, heightened competition for talented and skilled employees, agents and independent financial advisers may limit Prudential's potential to grow its business as quickly as planned or otherwise implement its strategy. Technological advances, including those enabling increased capability for gathering large volumes of customer health data and developments in capabilities and tools for analysing and interpreting such data (such as AI and machine learning), may result in increased competition to the Group, both from within and outside the insurance industry, and may increase the competition risks resulting from a failure to be able to attract or retain talent.\n\nThe Group's principal competitors include global life insurers, regional insurers and multinational asset managers. In most markets, there are also local companies that have a material market presence.\n\nPrudential believes that competition will intensify across all regions in response to consumer demand, digital and other technological advances (including the use of AI to improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experiences), the need for economies of scale and the consequential impact of consolidation, regulatory actions and other factors. Prudential's ability to generate an appropriate return depends significantly upon its capacity to anticipate and respond appropriately to these competitive pressures. This includes managing the potential adverse impacts to the commercial value of the Group's existing sale and distribution arrangements, such as bancassurance arrangements, in markets where new distribution channels develop.\n\nFailure to do so may adversely impact Prudential's ability to attract and retain customers and, importantly, may limit Prudential's ability to take advantage of new business arising in the markets in which it operates, which may have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.",

These risks may also adversely impact Prudential through its partners. Prudential relies on the performance and operations of a number of bancassurance, product distribution, outsourcing (including but not limited to external technology, data hosting and payments), and service partners. These include back office support functions, such as those relating to technology infrastructure, development and support, and customerfacing operations and services, such as product distribution and services (including through digital channels), and investment operations. This creates reliance upon the resilient operational performance of these partners and exposes Prudential to the risk that the operations and services provided by these partners are disrupted or fail. Further, Prudential operates in extensive and evolving legal and regulatory environments which adds to the complexity of the governance and operation of its business processes and controls.\n\nExposure to such risks could impact Prudential's operational resilience and ability to perform necessary business functions if there are disruptions to its systems, operations, new business sales and renewals, distribution channels and services to customers, or could result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data. Such risks, as well as any weaknesses in administration systems (such as those relating to policyholder records) or actuarial reserving processes, may also result in increased expenses, as well as legal and regulatory sanctions, decreased profitability, financial loss and customer conduct risk impacts. This could damage Prudential's reputation and relationship with its customers and business partners. A failure to adequately oversee service partners (or their technology and operational systems and processes) could result in significant service degradation or disruption to Prudential's business operations and services to its customers, which may have reputational or conduct risk implications and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPrudential's business requires the processing of a large number of transactions for a diverse range of products. It also employs complex and inter-connected technology and finance systems, models and user-centric applications in its processes to perform a range of operational functions. These functions include the calculation of regulatory or internal capital requirements, the valuation of assets and liabilities, and the acquisition of new business using AI and digital\n\napplications. Many of these tools form an integral part of the information and decision-making frameworks used by Prudential and the risk of adverse consequences arising from erroneous or misinterpreted tools used in core business activities, decision-making and reporting exists. Errors or limitations in these tools, or their inappropriate usage, may lead to regulatory breaches, inappropriate decision-making, financial loss, customer detriment, inaccurate external reporting or reputational damage. The long-term nature of much of the Group's business also means that accurate records are to be maintained securely for significant time periods.\n\nThe performance of the Group's core business activities and the uninterrupted availability of services to customers rely significantly on, and require significant investment in, resilient IT applications, infrastructure and security architectural design, data governance and management and other operational systems, personnel, controls, and mature processes. During large-scale disruptive events or times of significant change, or due to other factors impacting operational performance including adequacy of skilled/experienced personnel, the resilience and operational effectiveness of these systems and processes at Prudential and/or its third-party service providers may be adversely impacted. In particular, Prudential and its business partners are making increasing use of emerging technological tools and digital services, or forming strategic partnerships with third parties to provide these capabilities. Automated distribution channels and services to customers increase the criticality of providing uninterrupted services. A failure to implement appropriate governance and management of the incremental operational risks from emerging technologies may adversely impact Prudential's reputation and brand, the results of its operations, its ability to attract and retain customers and its ability to deliver on its long-term strategy and therefore its competitiveness and long-term financial success.\n\nAlthough Prudential's technology, compliance and other operational systems, models and processes incorporate strong governance and controls designed to manage and mitigate the operational and model risks associated with its activities, there can be no complete assurance as to the resilience of these systems and processes to disruption or that governance and controls will always be effective. Due to human error, among other reasons, operational and model risk incidents do occur from time to time and no system or process can entirely prevent them. Prudential's legacy and other technology systems, data and processes, as with operational systems and processes generally, may also be susceptible to failure or security/data breaches.",

        "page_content": "3.4 Cyber security risks, including attempts to access or disrupt Prudential's technology systems, and loss or misuse of personal data, could have potential adverse financial impacts on the Group and could result in loss of trust from Prudential's customers and employees and reputational damage, which in turn could have material adverse effects on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPrudential and its business partners are increasingly exposed to the risk that individuals (which includes connected persons such as employees, contractors or representatives of Prudential or its thirdparty service providers, and unconnected persons) or groups may intentionally or unintentionally disrupt the availability, confidentiality and integrity of its technology systems or compromise the integrity and security of data (both corporate and customer), including disruption from ransomware (malicious software designed to restrict Prudential's access to data until the payment of a sum of money and to exfiltrate data with a threat to publicly expose Prudential data if a ransom payment is not paid), and targeted and untargeted but sophisticated attacks. Where these risks materialise, this could result in disruption to key operations, make it difficult to recover critical data or services or damage assets, any of which could result in loss of trust from Prudential's customers and employees, reputational damage and direct or indirect financial loss.\n\nThe vast amount of personal and financial data held by financial services companies makes them attractive targets for cyber crime groups. The ease and accessibility of ransomware exploit toolkits and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) for threat actors contribute to the increase in ransomware activity. At the same time, cyber security threats continue to evolve globally in sophistication and potential significance. Prudential's increasing profile in its current markets and those in which it is entering, growing customer interest in interacting with their insurance providers and asset managers through the internet and social media, improved brand awareness, and increasing adoption of the Group's digital platforms could also increase the likelihood of Prudential being considered a target by cyber criminals.\n\nThere is an increasing requirement and expectation on Prudential and its business partners not only to hold the data of customers, shareholders and employees securely, but also to ensure its ongoing accuracy and that it is being used in a transparent, appropriate and ethical way, including in decision-making where automated processes are employed. As Prudential and its business partners increasingly adopt digital technology in business operations, the data the Group generates creates an opportunity to enhance customer engagement while maintaining a responsibility to keep customers' personal data safe. Various policies and frameworks are in place to govern the handling of customers' data. A failure to adhere to these polices may result in regulatory scrutiny and sanctions and detriment to customers\n\nand third-party partners, and may adversely impact the reputation and brand of the Group, its ability to attract and retain customers, and deliver on its long-term strategy, and therefore the results of its operations.\n\nThe risk to the Group of not meeting these requirements and expectations may be increased by the development of cloud-based infrastructure and the usage of digital distribution and service channels, which can collect a broader range of personal and healthrelated data from individuals at increased scale and speed, and the use of complex tools, machine learning and AI technologies to process, analyse and interpret this data.\n\nNew and currently unforeseeable regulatory, reputational and operational issues may also arise from the increased use of emerging technology such as generative AI which requires careful consideration and guardrails established to enable its safe use. Regulatory developments in cyber security and data protection continue to progress worldwide. In 2023, the momentum in focus on data privacy continued to increase, with regulators in Asia introducing new data privacy laws or enhancing existing ones (eg new data protection laws in Vietnam in June 2023 and extensive amendments to the Korean data privacy law). Such developments may increase the complexity of requirements and obligations in this area, in particular where they include national security restrictions or impose differing and/or conflicting requirements compared with those of other jurisdictions. These risks may also increase the financial and reputational implications for Prudential of regulatory non-compliance or a significant breach of IT systems or data, including at its joint ventures or third-party service providers. The international transfer of data may, as a global organisation, increase regulatory risks for the Group.\n\nPrudential has been, and likely will continue to be, subject to potential damage from computer viruses, unauthorised access and cyber security attacks such as 'denial of service' attacks, phishing and disruptive software campaigns. Despite the multi-layered security defences in place, there can be no assurance that such events will not take place and they may have material adverse consequential effects on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

        "page_content": "Risk factors continued\n\n## 3.5 Prudential's digital platforms may heighten existing business risks to the Group or introduce new risks as the markets in which it operates, and its partnerships and product offerings evolve.\n\nPrudential's digital platforms are subject to a number of risks. In particular, these include risks related to: legal and regulatory compliance and the conduct of business; the execution of complex change initiatives; information security and data privacy; the use of models (including those using artificial intelligence) and the handling of personal data; the resilience and integrity of IT infrastructure and operations; and those relating to the management of third parties. These existing risks for the Group may be increased due to a number of factors:\n\n- - The number of current and planned markets in which Prudential's digital platforms operate, each with their own laws and regulations, regulatory and supervisory authorities, the scope of application of which may be uncertain or change at pace, may increase regulatory compliance risks;\n- - The implementation of planned digital platforms and services, which may require the delivery of complex, inter-connected change initiatives across current and planned markets. This may give rise to design and execution risks, which could be amplified where these change initiatives are delivered concurrently;\n- -The increased volume, breadth and sensitivity of data on which the digital platforms are dependent and to which the Group has access, holds, analyses and processes through its models, increases data security, privacy and usage risks. Furthermore, the use of complex models, including where AI is used for critical decision-making, in an application's features and offerings may give rise to ethical, operational, conduct, litigation and reputational risks if they do not function as intended;\n- - Reliance on and/or collaboration with a number of third-party partners and providers, which may vary according to the market. This may increase operational disruption risks to the uninterrupted provision of services to customers, regulatory compliance and conduct risks, and the potential for reputational risks; and\n- - Support for, and development of, the platform being provided outside some of the individual markets in which the platform operates, which may increase the complexity of local legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nNew product offerings and functionality may be developed and provided through the digital platforms, which may introduce new regulatory, operational, conduct and strategic risks for the Group. Regulations may be introduced, which limit the permitted scope of online or digitally distributed insurance and asset management services and may restrict current or planned offerings provided by the platform.\n\nA failure to implement appropriate governance and management of the incremental and new risks detailed above may adversely impact Prudential's reputation and brand, its ability to attract and retain customers, its competitiveness, its ability to deliver on its long-term strategy and the financial position of the Group.\n\n3.6 Prudential operates in certain markets with joint venture partners and other shareholders and third parties. These businesses face the same risks as the rest of the Group and also give rise to certain risks to Prudential that the Group does not face with respect to its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\nPrudential operates, and in certain markets is required by local regulation to operate, through joint ventures and other joint ownership or third-party arrangements (including associates). The financial condition, operations and reputation of the Group may be adversely impacted, or the Group may face regulatory censure, in the event that any of its partners fails or is unable to meet its obligations under the arrangements, encounters financial difficulty, or fails to comply with local or international regulation and standards such as those pertaining to the prevention of financial crime and sustainability (including climate-related) risks (see risk factor 2 above). Reputational risks to the Group are amplified where any joint ventures or jointly owned businesses carry the Prudential name.\n\nA material proportion of the Group's business comes from its joint venture and associate businesses in the Chinese Mainland and India, respectively. For such operations the level of control exercisable by the Group depends on the terms of the contractual agreements as well as local regulatory constraints applicable to the joint venture and associate businesses, such as listing requirements; and in particular those terms providing for the allocation of control among, and continued cooperation between, the participants. As a result, the level of oversight, control and access to management information the Group is able to exercise at these operations may be lower compared to the Group's wholly-owned businesses. This may increase the uncertainty for the Group over the financial condition of these operations, including the valuation of their investment portfolios and the extent of their invested credit and counterparty credit risk exposure, resulting in heightened risks to the Group as a whole. This may particularly be the case where the geographies in which these operations are located experience market or sector-specific\n\nslowdowns, disruption, volatility or deterioration (such as the negative developments in the Chinese Mainland property sector and more widely across the Chinese Mainland economy). In addition, the level of control exercisable by the Group could be affected by changes in the maximum level of foreign ownership imposed on foreign companies in certain jurisdictions. The exposure of the Group to the risks detailed in risk factor 3.1 above may also increase should the Group's strategic initiatives include the expansion of the Group's operations through joint ventures or jointly owned businesses.\n\nIn addition, a significant proportion of the Group's product distribution is carried out through agency arrangements and contractual arrangements with third-party service providers not controlled by Prudential, such as bancassurance arrangements, and the Group is therefore dependent upon the continuation of these relationships. The effectiveness of these arrangements, or temporary or permanent disruption to them, such as through significant deterioration in the reputation, financial position or other circumstances of the third-party service providers, material failure in controls (such as those pertaining to the third-party service providers' systems failure or the prevention of financial crime), regulatory changes affecting their governance or operation, or their failure to meet any regulatory requirements could adversely affect Prudential's reputation and its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

In particular, the Group's medical insurance businesses are also exposed to medical inflation risk. The potential adverse impacts to the profitability of the Group's businesses from the upheavals in financial markets and levels of economic activity on customer behaviours are described in risk factor 1.1 above. While the Group has the ability to reprice some of its products, the frequency of repricing may need to be increased. Such repricing is dependent on the availability of operational and resource capacity to do so, as well as the Group's ability to implement such repricing in light of the increased regulatory and societal expectations reflecting the affordability of insurance products and the protection of vulnerable customers, as well as the commercial considerations of the markets the Group operates in. The profitability of the Group's businesses also may be adversely impacted by the medical reimbursement downgrade experience following any repricing.\n\nPrudential, like other insurers, needs to make assumptions about a number of factors in determining the pricing of its products, for setting reserves, and for reporting its capital levels and the results of its long-term business operations. A further factor is the assumptions that Prudential makes about future expected levels of the rates of early termination of products by its customers (known as persistency). This is relevant to a number of lines of business in the Group. Prudential's persistency assumptions reflect a combination of recent past experience for each relevant line of business and expert judgement, especially where a lack of relevant and credible\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risks relating to legal and regulatory requirements\n\n4.1 Prudential conducts its businesses subject to regulation and associated regulatory risks, including a change to the basis of the regulatory supervision or intervention of the Group, the level of regulatory scrutiny arising from the Group's reported events, the effects and pace of changes in the laws, regulations, policies and their interpretations and any industry/accounting standards in the markets in which it operates.\n\nAny non-compliance with government policy and legislation, financial control measures on companies and individuals, regulation or regulatory interpretation applying to companies in the financial services and insurance industries in any of the markets in which Prudential operates (including those related to the business conduct of Prudential or its distributors), or decisions taken by regulators in connection with their supervision of members of the Group, which in some circumstances may be applied retrospectively, may adversely affect Prudential. Further, the impact from regulatory changes may be material to Prudential, for instance, changes may be required to its product range, distribution channels, sales and servicing practices, handling of data, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, risk management approaches, corporate or governance structure, financial and non-financial disclosures and reported results and financing requirements. Other changes in capital-related regulations have the potential to change the extent of sensitivity of capital to market factors, regulators in jurisdictions in which Prudential operates may impose requirements affecting the allocation of capital and liquidity between different business units in the Group, whether on a geographic, legal entity, product line or other basis. Regulators may also change solvency requirements, methodologies for determining components of the regulatory or statutory balance sheet, including\n\nthe reserves and the level of capital required to be held by individual businesses (with implications to the Group capital position). Furthermore, as a result of interventions by governments in light of financial and global economic conditions, there may continue to be changes in government regulation and supervision of the financial services industry, potentially resulting in tightened customer protection, higher capital requirements, restrictions on transactions and enhancement of supervisory powers.\n\nIn the markets in which Prudential operates, it is subject to regulatory requirements for ongoing operations as well as obligations with respect to financial crime, including anti-money laundering, and sanctions compliance, which may either impose obligations on the Group to act in a certain manner or restrict the way that it can act in respect of specified individuals, organisations, businesses and/or governments. A failure to do so may adversely impact the reputation of Prudential and/or result in the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions or restrictions on the Group. For internationally active groups such as Prudential, operating across multiple jurisdictions including cross-border activities increases the complexity and volume of legal and regulatory compliance challenges. Compliance with Prudential's legal or regulatory obligations, including those in respect\n\nexperience data exists. Any expected change in future persistency is also reflected in the assumptions. If actual levels of persistency are significantly different than assumed, the Group's results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Prudential's business may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics and other effects that give rise to a large number of deaths or additional sickness claims, as well as increases to the cost of medical claims. Pandemics, significant influenza and other epidemics have occurred a number of times historically, but the likelihood, timing or severity of future events cannot be predicted. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and nongovernmental organisations, in combating the spread and severity of any epidemics, as well as pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines (and their roll-outs) and non-pharmaceutical interventions, could have a material impact on the Group's claims experience.\n\nPrudential uses reinsurance to selectively transfer mortality, morbidity and other risks. This exposes the Group to: the counterparty risk of a reinsurer being unable to pay reinsurance claims or otherwise meet their commitments; the risk that a reinsurer changes reinsurance terms and conditions of coverage, or increases the price of reinsurance which Prudential is unable to pass on to its customers; the risk of ambiguity in the reinsurance terms and conditions leading to uncertainty whether an event is covered under a reinsurance contract; and the risk of being unable to replace an existing reinsurer, or find a new reinsurer, for the risk transfer being sought.\n\nAny of the foregoing, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

Geopolitical and global tensions may also lead to realignment among blocs or global polarisation and decoupling, which may lead to an increase in the volume and complexity of international sanctions. These risks may be increased where uncertainty exists on the scope of regulatory requirements and obligations, and where the complexity of specific cases applicable to the Group is high.\n\nFurther information on specific areas of regulatory and supervisory requirements or changes are included below.\n\n## a Group-wide Supervision (GWS)\n\nThe Hong Kong Insurance Authority (Hong Kong IA) is the Groupwide supervisor for Prudential. The Hong Kong IA's Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework applies on a principles-based and outcome-focused approach, which allows the Hong Kong IA to exercise direct regulatory powers over the designated holding companies of multinational insurance groups. Prudential has in place various monitoring mechanisms and controls to ensure ongoing sustainable compliance and to promote constructive engagement with the Hong Kong IA as its Group-wide supervisor.\n\n## b Global regulatory developments and systemic risk regulation\n\nThere are a number of ongoing global regulatory developments which could potentially impact Prudential's businesses in the many jurisdictions in which they operate. Mandated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), this work includes standard setting and guidance in the areas of systemic risk (including climate-related risks) and the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS).\n\nFor the insurance sector, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) continues to monitor and assess systemic risk through the Holistic Framework (HF) which effectively replaced the Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII) designations in 2019. The FSB continues to receive an annual update on the outcomes of the IAIS's global monitoring exercise which will include IAIS's assessment of systemic risk. The FSB reserves the right to publicly express its views on whether an individual insurer is systemically important in the global context and the application of any necessary HF supervisory policy measures to address such systemic importance. In November 2025, the FSB will review the process for assessing and mitigating systemic risk under the HF. Following this review the FSB will, as necessary, adjust its process which could include reinstating an updated G-SII identification process. Many of the prior G-SII measures have been adopted into IAIS's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) and Common Framework (ComFrame), described below, as well as under the Hong Kong IA's GWS Framework. As an Internationally Active Insurance Group (IAIG), Prudential is subject to these measures.\n\nThe IAIS's ComFrame establishes quantitative and qualitative supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective Groupwide supervision of IAIGs. The ICS is the quantitative element of ComFrame and a consolidated capital standard in the final phase of development, coming into effect in 2025. Prudential has been designated an IAIG by the Hong Kong IA following an assessment against the established qualitative criteria in ComFrame, and will be required to either adopt ICS or demonstrate its current Group capital supervisory framework to be outcome-equivalent with ICS.\n\nThe development of ICS has been conducted in two phases: a fiveyear monitoring phase, which commenced at the beginning of 2020, followed by an implementation phase. An alternative to the ICS called the 'Aggregation Method' has also been developed in the US by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; the IAIS is\n\nin the process of evaluating whether it produces comparable outcomes to the ICS.\n\nThere is a risk attached to the manner in which regulators from member jurisdictions may choose to implement the HF and ICS which could lead to additional burdens or adverse impacts to the Group. As a result, there remains a degree of uncertainty over the potential impact of such changes on the Group.\n\n## c Regional regulatory regime developments\n\nIn 2023, regulators in the markets in which we operate continued to focus on the financial resilience of the insurance industry (including to address issues of solvency and rising interest rates), the protection of customers in relation to product and service performances and operational soundness with appropriate governance and controls. New regulations and guidelines were issued in several markets whereby the industry is required to assess, monitor and manage nonfinancial and financial risks, including insurance risk, capital and solvency. Business conduct and consumer protection remain the key priorities for regulators in Asia, with emphases on product design, remuneration structure, marketing literature, sales and servicing practices, and various operational processes including specifically for investment management and oversight of third parties and technology vendors.\n\nMajor regulatory changes and reforms are in progress in some of the Group's key markets, with some uncertainty on the full impact to Prudential:\n\n- -In the Chinese Mainland, regulatory developments across a number of industries including the financial sector have continued, potentially increasing compliance risk to the Group. Key regulatory developments in the Chinese Mainland include the following:\n- -As part of the regulatory reform, the Chinese government has consolidated oversight of the financial industry directly under the State Council and announced a new national financial regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA) to replace the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) on 18 May 2023. The NFRA is authorised to overall supervise and regulate the Chinese Mainland banking and insurance markets to ensure financial institutions operate in a stable manner in compliance with the law and meet their obligations to customers. Key changes implemented by the NFRA include: reductions in statutory valuation interest rates for life insurance products, which are expected to lower pricing interest rate, effective from July 2023; and solvency relief measures through the China Risk Oriented Solvency System Phase II (C-ROSS II), effective from September 2023. In early 2024, further regulatory changes have been issued including: reductions in crediting rates for universal life products; requirements on consistency between reported and incurred bancassurance commissions and expenses; and new measures for setting requirements for insurance sales conduct, product design, marketing and disclosures.\n- -The amendment of the Insurance Law of the People's Republic of China is in progress with emphasis on corporate governance including appointment of directors, fiduciary duties, and supervision of participating and investment-linked product (ILP) policies. The implementation timeline is yet to be announced.\n- -In Indonesia, regulatory and supervisory focus on the insurance industry remains high. In 2023, the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) issued a five-year industry roadmap with plans to establish an insurance industry that upholds high integrity, strengthens consumer and public protection, and supports national economic growth. The roadmap covers areas to enhance policyholder protection as well as other aspects on licensing, data, capital, products, actuarial, risk and controls. Implementation of this roadmap is in three phases from 2023 to 2027, including",

BNM also revised its policy on Management of Customer Information and Permitted Disclosures in April 2023, which sets out requirements regarding controls in collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing, disclosure and disposal of customer information. Furthermore, a new regulation on professionalism of agents came into effect on 1 January 2024, requiring additional 'fit and proper' and due diligence procedures as enhanced agent onboarding and screening requirements.\n- - In Hong Kong, the revised Guideline GL3 on anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) was published with an effective date of 1 June 2023. The Hong Kong Government also proposed to establish a Policy Holders' Protection Scheme in December 2022 as a safety net for policyholders in the event of an insurer's insolvency. Public views were sought in 2023 and the legislation process is expected to commence in the second half of 2024 at the earliest.\n- - In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has designated the Group's Singapore business as a domestic systemically important insurer. Furthermore, in order to mitigate money laundering risk in the financial sector as a whole, the MAS has been soliciting feedback from industry stakeholders to improve anti-money laundering standards. Further regulatory developments are expected.\n- - In Thailand, the Office of Insurance Commission presented draft amendments to the life and non-life insurance laws in December 2023, aimed at elevating governance standards within the insurance industry. The amendments are currently under review.\n- - In Vietnam, the amended Insurance Law took effect on 1 January 2023. The new law contains provisions on RBC, with a five-year grace period, effective from 1 January 2028. The Vietnamese Government also issued a decree for personal data privacy guidance with an effective date of 1 July 2023, which provides definitions of personal data with examples of sensitive personal data, the rights of data subjects, and notification and data transfer requirements pertaining to the use of data. Another implementing circular of the Insurance Law issued in November 2023 also requires mandatory voice recording for sales, agency remuneration limits, and a cooling-off period for lending customers.\n- - In the Philippines, financial product and customer service requirements were issued by the Insurance Commission in March 2023 with an 18-month transition period for adoption. The new requirements include product and service disclosures, a systematic approach to customer assistance and conduct risk management, as well as additional complaints filing.\n- - In India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) continues to focus on industry reform. Its 'Insurance for All by 2047' proposal aims to ensure that every citizen and enterprise in India has adequate life, health and property insurance cover. The IRDAI is promoting the use of technology, such as big data, AI and machine learning, to transform the insurance landscape in the country, in order to become the sixth-largest insurance market by 2032. A new income tax rule took effect from 1 April 2023, which makes maturity proceeds of insurance policies taxable for policies issued from this date which have annual premiums exceeding INR 500,000. Another IRDAI regulation issued in March 2023 removed commission payment limits for insurers, with the aim of giving more operational flexibility to insurers and enhancing insurance penetration.\n\nThe increasing use of emerging technological tools and digital services across the industry is likely to lead to new and unforeseen\n\nregulatory requirements and issues, including expectations regarding the governance, ethical and responsible use of technology, AI and data. Distribution and product suitability linked to innovation continues to set the pace of conduct regulatory change in Asia. Prudential falls within the scope of these conduct regulations, requiring that regulatory changes are appropriately implemented.\n\nThe pace and volume of sustainability-related regulatory changes including ESG and climate-related changes are also increasing. Regulators including the Hong Kong IA, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the BNM in Malaysia and the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan are in the process of developing supervisory and disclosure requirements or guidelines related to environmental and climate change risk management. Other regulators are expected to develop or are at different stages of developing similar requirements. While the Hong Kong IA has yet to propose any insurance-specific regulations on sustainability and climate, it has regularly emphasised its increasing focus in this area in order to support Hong Kong's position as a regional green finance hub. In 2023, the Hong Kong IA invited Hong Kong authorised insurers to participate in a survey regarding their implementation of climate risk management practices. The purpose of the survey was for the Hong Kong IA to understand any gaps and challenges faced by the insurance sector in managing climate-related financial risks and to develop appropriate guidance for insurers. International regulatory and supervisory bodies, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and Taskforce on Nature-related Disclosures, are progressing on global sustainability and climate-related disclosure requirements. Recent high-profile examples of government and regulatory enforcement and civil actions against companies for misleading investors on sustainability and ESG-related information demonstrate that disclosure, reputational and litigation risks remain high and may increase, in particular as companies increase their disclosures or product offerings in this area. International and local regulatory and industry bodies are beginning to establish principles and standards with regards to the use of sustainability and ESG nomenclature in the labelling of investment products. These changes and developments may give rise to regulatory compliance, customer conduct, operational, reputational and disclosure risks requiring Prudential to coordinate across multiple jurisdictions in order to apply a consistent risk management approach.\n\nA rapid pace and high volume of regulatory changes and interventions, and the swiftness of their application, including those driven by the financial services industry, have been observed in recent years across many of the Group's markets. The transformation and regulatory changes have the potential to introduce new, or increase existing, regulatory risks and supervisory interest while increasing the complexity of ensuring concurrent regulatory compliance across markets driven by the potential for increased intra-Group connectivity and dependencies. In jurisdictions with ongoing policy initiatives and regulatory developments which will impact the way Prudential is supervised, these developments are monitored at market and group level and inform the Group's risk framework and engagement with government policymakers, industry groups and regulators.\n\n## d IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17 became effective from 1 January 2023 and the first external reporting under this basis was in half year 2023. The new standard requires a fundamental change to accounting, presentation and disclosures for insurance contracts as well as the application of significant judgement and new estimation techniques. These changes mean that investors, rating agencies and other stakeholders may take time to gain familiarity with the new standard and to interpret the Group's business performance and dynamics. In addition, comparison with previous financial reporting periods will be more challenging in the short term. New systems, processes and controls have been developed to align with the new IFRS 17 basis and are expected to mature over time. In the short",

As a major participant in the majority of its chosen markets, circumstances could arise in which Prudential, along with other companies, may be required to make such contributions.\n\n## 4.2 The conduct of business in a way that adversely impacts the fair treatment of customers could have a negative impact on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or on its relations with current and potential customers.\n\nIn the course of its operations and at any stage of the customer and product life cycle, the Group or its intermediaries may conduct business in a way that adversely impacts customer outcomes and the fair treatment of customers ('conduct risk'). This may arise through a failure to design, provide and promote suitable products and services to customers that meet their needs, are clearly explained or deliver real value, provide and promote a high standard of customer service, appropriately and responsibly manage customer information, or appropriately handle and assess complaints. A failure to identify or implement appropriate governance and management of conduct risk may result in harm to customers and regulatory sanctions and restrictions, and may adversely impact Prudential's reputation and brand, its ability to attract and retain customers, its competitiveness, and its ability to deliver on its long-term strategy. There is an increased focus by regulators and supervisors on customer protection, suitability and inclusion across the markets in which the Group operates, thereby increasing regulatory compliance and reputational risks to the Group in the event the Group is unable to effectively implement the regulatory changes and reforms stated in risk factor 4.1 above.\n\nPrudential is, and in the future may continue to be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of its business on matters relevant to the delivery of customer outcomes. Such actions relate, and could in the future relate, to the application of current regulations or the failure to implement new regulations, regulatory reviews of broader industry practices and products sold (including in relation to lines of business that are no longer active) in the past under acceptable industry or market practices at the time and changes to the tax regime affecting products. Regulators may also focus on the approach that product providers use to select third-party distributors and to monitor the appropriateness of sales made by them and the responsibility of product providers for the deficiencies of third-party distributors.\n\nThere is a risk that new regulations introduced may have a material adverse effect on the sales of the products by Prudential and increase Prudential's exposure to legal risks. Any regulatory action arising out of the Group's position as a product provider could have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or otherwise harm its reputation.\n\n## 4.3 Litigation, disputes and regulatory investigations may adversely affect Prudential's business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPrudential is, and may in the future be, subject to legal actions, disputes and regulatory investigations in various contexts, including in the ordinary course of its insurance, asset management and other business operations. These legal actions, disputes and investigations may relate to aspects of Prudential's businesses and operations that are specific to Prudential, or that are common to companies that operate in Prudential's markets. Legal actions and disputes may arise under contracts, regulations or from a course of conduct taken by\n\nPrudential, including class action litigation. Although Prudential believes that it has adequately provided in all material respects for the costs of litigation and regulatory matters, no assurance can be provided that such provisions are sufficient. Given the large or indeterminate amounts of damages sometimes sought, other sanctions that might be imposed and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes, it is possible that an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects.",

Significant tax disputes with tax authorities, and any change in the tax status of any member of the Group or in taxation legislation or its scope or interpretation could affect Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is currently undertaking a project intended to modernise the global international tax system, commonly referred to as Base Erosion and ProfitShifting 2.0. The project has two pillars. The first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between jurisdictions for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell cross-border goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence. The second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of 15 per cent applicable to inscope multinational enterprises.\n\nOn 8 October 2021 the OECD issued a statement setting out the highlevel principles which have been agreed by over 130 jurisdictions involved in the project. Based on the 8 October 2021 OECD statement, Prudential does not expect to be affected by proposals under the first pillar given they include an exemption for regulated financial services companies.\n\nOn 20 December 2021 the OECD published detailed model rules for the second pillar, with implementation of the rules initially envisaged by 2023. Due to the complexity of the rules, the implementation date was subsequently postponed to commence no earlier than 2024 to provide multinational enterprises and tax authorities sufficient time to prepare. These rules will apply to the Group when implemented into the national law of jurisdictions where it has entities within the scope of the rules. On 14 March 2022 the OECD issued detailed guidance to assist with interpreting the model rules. As part of the OECD's development of the implementation framework, the OECD published guidance on transitional safe harbours on 20 December 2022, and additional administrative guidance on 2 February 2023, 17 July 2023 and 18 December 2023 providing further updates and clarifications on how to interpret the model rules. The OECD is expected to publish further new guidance in 2024 which will affect the interpretation of already implemented legislation.\n\nA number of jurisdictions in which the Group has operations - Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Vietnam and the UK - have implemented either a global minimum tax or a domestic minimum tax at a rate of 15 per cent, in line with the OECD proposals, effective for 2024 onwards. Malaysia has implemented both the global minimum tax and domestic minimum tax effective for 2025 onwards. Other jurisdictions where Prudential has a taxable presence, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, intend to implement the proposals for 2025 onwards.\n\nFor those jurisdictions where either a global minimum tax or a domestic minimum tax or both have been implemented with effect for 2024, no material impact to the Group's IFRS tax charge for the 2024 financial year is expected. The implementation of a global minimum tax and a domestic minimum tax in Malaysia effective for 2025 is not expected to have a material impact for the Group's IFRS tax charge for the 2025 financial year. These assessments consider a number of factors including whether the transitional safe harbour is expected to apply based on the most recent filings of tax returns, country-by-country reporting and financial statements of the relevant entities. In some jurisdictions a global minimum tax but not a domestic minimum tax regime has been implemented and the Group's operations in that jurisdiction will not be subject to the rules as they are wholly domestic operations.\n\nFor those jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, where the proposals are expected to be implemented with effect from 2025 onwards, work is ongoing to assess the potential impact and guidance will be provided in due course. As a result, the full extent of the longterm impact on the Group's business, tax liabilities and profits remains uncertain.\n\nIn addition to the global minimum tax and domestic minimum tax rules, both Korea and Luxembourg have also implemented an undertaxed profits rule effective for 2025 onwards. The undertaxed profits rule is intended as a backstop provision to deal with jurisdictions in case of any delay or not implementing the global minimum tax or domestic minimum tax rules. As the rules in Hong Kong (where Prudential plc has been tax-resident since 3 March 2023) are expected to be in force and would apply to Prudential plc from 2025, the undertaxed profits rules implemented in Korea and Luxembourg are not expected to have any practical application to the Group.",

This requires each of the Directors to have regard, among other matters, to the interests of the Company's employees, the Company's relationship with customers and suppliers, and the impact of the Company's operations on the wider community. This statement sets out how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1)(a)-(f) of the UK Companies Act 2006 and details how the Board builds and maintains strong relationships with its stakeholders, how it gains an understanding of their interests, needs and concerns, and how the strength of these relationships contributes to the Company's success. Underlying its relationships with stakeholders are Prudential's purpose and values, which were refreshed by the Board in 2023, as communicated in our Half-Year Financial Report.\n\n## How Directors are supported in their duties\n\nUpon joining the Board, each Director is provided with an induction which includes a detailed briefing on Directors' duties, including those arising under Section 172, and an overview of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nAt each Board meeting, a briefing note reminding Directors of their Section 172 duties is made available. In addition, members of the management team who submit proposals to the Board for approval are required to address the Section 172 criteria in their papers, pointing out the potential impact their proposals may have on relevant stakeholders, or how stakeholder views have been considered. This ensures that members of the Board are sufficiently briefed, and that any materials provided support a robust discussion on the impact a proposal may have on the Group's stakeholders.\n\nA summary of the Board's stakeholder engagement activities in 2023 is set out in the following pages.\n\n## Case study: and\n\n## purpose values\n\nIn August 2023, we announced our new purpose - For Every Life, For Every Future - reflecting our mission to be the most trusted partner and protector for this generation and generations to come, by providing simple and accessible health and financial solutions. Alongside this we announced new value statements - The PruWay - which define how we set out to work together and deliver value for our stakeholders, be it our customers, people, shareholders or communities.\n\nThe development of our values was conducted in three stages: discovery, evidence and testing. The process was led by HR and Corporate Affairs, who hosted focus groups with colleagues at all levels of the organisation and across our markets.  The Chair and CEO shared emerging insights from this work at the Leadership Conference for our Top 200 leaders and discussed ideas on how the new approach to purpose, values and culture should match the Group's strategic ambitions and respond to changing market dynamics.\n\nSenior leaders, including our Non-executive Directors and GEC members, PruYoung professionals, which is our network of employees under 35, and HR leaders were interviewed to test multiple purpose statements and values to ensure that the messaging and approach was aligned and representative of our ambitions for the next chapter of growth for Prudential.  Testing was also extended to agency focus groups to ensure resonance and alignment with this important group of stakeholders representing Prudential externally.\n\nThe insights gained from the focus groups and interviews were combined with external research from investors and analysts, brand perceptions and internal research which included employee surveys, key learnings from past leadership conferences, and themes from our regional brand health tracker. The key themes and opportunities identified included telling a simple and clear story of how we aim to achieve our mission to be the most trusted partner and protector for this generation and generations to come, differentiation in our markets, creating value and ensuring this is underpinned by good governance and responsible business practices.\n\nThe RSWG and the Board discussed the emerging purpose and values and these were approved by the Board in July.\n\nThe roll-out began in August, with a series of GEC employee townhalls across our markets to embed the values, including operationalising changes to ensure we establish an environment where highly engaged employees demonstrate behaviour consistent with our desired culture and values. An example of this has been reviewing the reward methodology across the organisation to reflect our values.\n\nA Collaboration Jam to discuss our purpose, strategy and The PruWay and what they mean for employees in their daily lives was attended by more than 7,000 employees, including our Non-executive Directors. Following the multi-faceted employee engagement campaign, an employee survey conducted in November provided a first reflection on how well these value statements have been communicated and are resonating with people.  The results from the survey and Collaboration Jam were shared with the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group who, with the Board, will continue to monitor how values are being embedded across the organisation in 2024.",

Our key stakeholders are our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. The Board also engages with other stakeholders including the broader workforce, the broader investment community, regulators, governments and suppliers. Where conflicts between different stakeholder interests arise, we ensure these are taken into account and resolved as smoothly as possible, at the highest level necessary.\n\nThe Chair and management regularly report to the Board on interactions with investors, governments and regulators.  Directors are also briefed on customer needs as part of regular updates on specific parts of the business. During the year, customer needs were central to the Board's discussions, which focused heavily on refreshing the Group's strategy. In addition, Directors participated in employee engagement initiatives, while the Board also approved the new purpose and value statements, which had been co-created with our employees, to align with the Group's refreshed strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nOur customers are at the heart of what we do. Our purpose is to be partners for every life and protectors for every future. At Prudential, it is our mission to be the most trusted partner and protector for this generation and generations to come, by providing simple and accessible financial and health solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRelationships with our stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulators\n\nPrudential operates in highly regulated markets. Regulators supervise the insurance and asset management industries, promote general stability and protect policyholders. Prudential is committed to maintaining a constructive and open relationship with all of its regulators to ensure mutual trust, respect and understanding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe work with a range of suppliers and outsourcing providers to allow us to focus on our core business strengths and reduce costs. We believe that the conduct of our suppliers reflects on us, and has the potential to impact our standing, branding and reputation within the communities in which we operate. We therefore seek to build strong working relationships with all our suppliers.\n\nOur people are our most important asset and their engagement is fundamental to our ability to retain our current employees, motivate them to achieve success for themselves and Prudential and attract future talent. To support our strategic goals, the Board's focus is on creating an environment where talent thrives and powers growth and in which employees can connect, grow and succeed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities & governments\n\nGovernments and policymakers in the markets in which we operate are important stakeholders, setting and shaping the business and policy environment for the products and services  we deliver, the investments we make, and the value we can generate for individuals, families, communities and the wider economy. We contribute to the communities where we operate through our purpose-driven Sustainability Strategy, which is integrated into our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board recognises that  regular engagement secures investors' trust and promotes their ongoing investment and support. The Board is committed to the longterm delivery of shareholder returns through a combination of value appreciation and dividends, and to the delivery of credit investors' contractual rights to servicing and principal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees",

The RSWG discussed a refresh of Prudential's customer strategy framework in July, focusing on priorities to facilitate our strategic pillar of enhancing customer experiences by becoming our customers' most trusted partner by enriching their life, health and wealth journey.\n\nThe Board discussed customer strategy in July, following the more detailed RSWG engagement.  This included considering the value propositions offered to different customer segments, and how Prudential is supporting digitally-enabled customer journeys.  Further Board discussions on customer strategy took place in December as part of consideration of the operating plan for the next three years, and the Board agreed the metrics by which it would measure progress.\n\n## How the Group engages and communicates\n\nPrudential is committed to evolving from a Group which is organised around products and channels to becoming the most trusted partner to our customers. Our extensive distribution channels enable us to better understand and service our customers' financial needs. At the core of Prudential's work is helping customers achieve their healthcare and financial goals.\n\nPrudential engages directly with its customers through contact centres, dedicated account managers, face-to-face advice (where possible), mobile phone apps and telephone technical support teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrudential's engagement with customers is governed by the following principles:\n\n- 1. Treat customers fairly, honestly and with integrity.\n- 2. Provide and promote products and services that meet customer needs, are clearly explained and deliver real value.\n- 3. Maintain the confidentiality of our customer information.\n- 4. Provide and promote high standards of customer service.\n- 5. Act fairly and promptly to address customer complaints and any errors we find.\n\nDuring the year, each of the Group Executive Committee members, led by the Chief Executive Officer, participated in meetings with customers. This ensured that the voice of the customer was reflected in Board discussions.  Discussions on customers form part of each meeting of the Group Executive Committee, at which the Group Chief Customer & Marketing Officer provides updates on the latest customer experience initiatives and seeks the Committee's steer.\n\n## Impact of engagement on Board decision-making and outcomes\n\nThe outcome of our operational teams' engagement with customers is communicated through the business and used to shape the design of our products and how and where we distribute those products, and ultimately to inform strategic decisions made at Board level. Decisions about which markets to access, what kind of products to offer and how to develop our agency force, our bank partnerships and our digital capabilities, are all driven by an understanding of what customers want, based on engagement with those customers. The Board is supporting further development and embedding of a customer-centric organisational culture that promotes customer advocacy, which in turn will help improve NPS.\n\nMindful of the impact of macroeconomic trends on the cost of living for our customers, the Board monitors persistency trends and discusses with management how products and services are being adapted to respond to changing customer needs.\n\nThe Board also drove the development of our refreshed strategy to more clearly articulate our fundamental value of customers being at the heart of everything we do, and has been supporting the strengthening and embedding of a consistent Group-wide culture that is customer-centric.",

She also attended six shareholder meetings earlier in the year.\n- - The Remuneration Committee Chair attended 11 shareholder meetings ahead of the 2024 AGM, and 3 meetings with investor bodies.\n- - The Senior Independent Director also held meetings with investors and all Directors attended the Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n- - Management held 192 meetings with 244  individual institutional investors in Asia, the US, UK and Europe. Of these meetings, 162  were attended by either the CEO or CFO.\n\n## How the Board engages and communicates\n\nThe Board is made aware of major shareholder matters and concerns through a variety of sources including regular reporting by the CEO, the CFO and the Chief of Investor Relations.\n\nThe Chair holds an annual programme of engagement with major shareholders in respect of governance and strategic matters.\n\nThe Chair updates the Board on key themes emerging from her meetings which, during 2023-2024, included Chief Executive succession/transition, Board composition, business performance and strategy, key risks and other external factors affecting the share price, and sustainability topics.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee Chair conducts a separate annual engagement programme with key shareholders and proxy agencies on the Directors' Remuneration Policy and its implementation.  She reports to the Remuneration Committee in detail on the feedback from shareholders and to the Board on key themes.  The Remuneration Committee's advisers also provide updates on major investor and proxy agency views which the Committee takes into account in its decision-making.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director (SID) and Committee Chairs offer separate meetings to major investors.  In 2023, Philip Remnant wrote to major shareholders to offer introductory meetings with the incoming SID, Jeremy Anderson, and himself.\n\nThe Group's 2023 AGM adopted a hybrid approach, which allowed shareholders to attend either in person or online.  All Board members attended the AGM in person.  Prudential will continue to offer this hybrid approach, which allows the greatest flexibility for all shareholders across both the UK and Hong Kong.  Our 2024 Annual General Meeting will be held in Hong Kong as a hybrid meeting.\n\nIn addition, Prudential will offer a separate event in London for shareholder engagement in person with the Chair, the Chief Executive Officer and management later in the year.  More details will be shared with shareholders separately.\n\nLooking forward, the Board is considering conducting an investor perception audit during 2024 to deepen its understanding of the views of existing and potential investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How the Group engages and communicates\n\nThe Group seeks to maintain an open and active dialogue with investors. This ensures that the Group's strategy is well understood by the market and that investors' perspectives and concerns are communicated to the Board.\n\nThese meetings took a variety of forms in 2023 including oneon-one and group sessions, participation in panels, and walking tours organised in some cases by brokers. In Hong Kong, the Group carried out extensive face-to-face, online and radio interactions with stock commentators and retail brokers. In Europe, the Group uses a specialist firm to access under-serviced institutions, retail stockbrokers and private wealth management offices.\n\nIn 2023, investor engagement focused particularly on the introduction of the new Chief Executive Officer, the Group's subsequent strategic update, and supporting analysts and investors with understanding the new IFRS 17 accounting framework.\n\nInvestor relations activity in 2024 will continue to focus on communicating the Group's investment story and particularly progress in the execution of our updated strategy.\n\nWe continue to take active steps to support an increase in liquidity on the Hong Kong line of stock (ticker 2378 HK), including moving equity issuance under share schemes for employees and agents to the Hong Kong line where possible. We are engaging with both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and market participants to achieve faster and lower-cost transfers of shareholdings from the London line.\n\nNearly half of our coverage analysts are now located in the Asia region and actively cover our Asian regional peers. We will continue working with Asian-based research franchises to support and build coverage of the stock by those located close to our operating markets. At the same time we continue to provide support to the European research teams.\n\n## Impact of engagement on Board decision-making and outcomes\n\nThe Board regularly discusses investor views as part of its decision-making and seeks to deliver long-term sustainable value for investors, whilst also taking into account the interests of other stakeholders.  Regular engagement with investors by the Chair and management, with time allocated in each scheduled Board meeting for the reporting of feedback, ensured that in 2023 investor views were heard in the boardroom and that the Board's strategy and approach to key decisions were understood by investors.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee Chair provided detailed briefings to the Remuneration Committee and, where appropriate, the full Board on matters raised by investors.  Feedback from investors forms a key part in the Committee's formulation of the Directors' Remuneration Policy and its implementation.",

The Board has chosen to adopt a collective approach to employee engagement, led by the RSWG. This enables Directors to interact directly with the workforce, hear their views and questions, and help embed the organisational culture. The Board is satisfied that the current arrangements are effective and will continue to monitor them on a periodic basis.\n\nThe RSWG along with other Non-executive Directors participated in workforce engagement activities.  Key engagement activities included:\n\n- - Attendance by the Chair of the RSWG, George Sartorel, and Arijit Basu at Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council meetings;\n- - Attendance by the Chair of the Board at townhall meetings and leadership team meetings in Hong Kong and at local offices;\n- - Various Non-executive Directors attended graduation ceremonies of Prudential's flagship leadership development programme;\n- - Non-executive Directors participated in the 2023 Collaboration Jam;\n- - As part of the Board visit to Prudential Hong Kong Limited in April, the Board spent time with local and Group management teams and talent, as well as with agency leaders; and\n- - Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff and Jeanette Wong visited our Indonesia and Singapore offices for various meetings with the local leadership teams and informal events with top talent.\n\nIn addition to its direct engagement with the workforce, the Board receives regular updates on employee matters from the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer and local business leaders. The Board, supported by the RSWG, oversees Prudential's people strategy and receives updates on talent development and people metrics. The RSWG reviews in detail the output from employee engagement surveys and the Collaboration Jam, a crowd-sourced conversation online, supported by our external advisers HSM, and discusses followup actions with management. This is also discussed at Board meetings.\n\nThe RSWG is regularly updated on the D&I Council's meetings and the Group's D&I initiatives. Through attendance at D&I Council meetings, Non-executive Directors have been able to experience directly how the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup is fulfilling its role and gain a better understanding of the progress being made and an appreciation of different initiatives in support of the Group's goal to empower employees and create a sense of belonging through respect and appreciation of differences.\n\n## How the Group engages and communicates\n\nPrudential is committed to creating an inclusive environment which welcomes commonalities and values differences. We therefore endeavour to provide a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and harassment, including those based on race, gender, religion, colour, national or ethnic origin, marital status, sexual orientation, age, disability or any other characteristic protected by law. This also means that Prudential is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nThe Group engages with the workforce throughout the year. Highlights include employee surveys and the Collaboration Jam. These surveys provide valuable insights into employees' sense of belonging and their key priorities, alongside areas for further improvement.\n\nPrudential offers leadership development programmes across the Group, designed to deepen participants' self-awareness and empower them to lead with authenticity and purpose.\n\nPrudential's D&I Council is co-chaired by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the Chief Human Resources Officer and comprises leaders from across the Group.  It is responsible for defining a global D&I strategy, promoting and championing D&I initiatives in the various businesses, and challenging the organisation.\n\nExtensive engagement of employees took place as part of the development and roll-out of the new purpose and values (see case study on purpose and values).\n\n## Impact of engagement on Board decision-making and outcomes\n\nThe Board and RSWG discussed with management the output of the annual employee engagement survey and the Collaboration Jam and how feedback was being addressed in people initiatives. They also received regular updates on people issues and discussed with management the ongoing initiatives to support the workforce, including support for staff wellbeing, embedding the Group's values throughout the organisation, and developing talent and a diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\n## > For more information, please refer to pages 50 to 55 of the Sustainability Report.\n\nMembers of the RSWG and other Non-executive Directors spent time with employees to hear from them directly and shared feedback with the Board.\n\nThrough their engagements, the Board has gained deeper insight into: the Group's operations across different markets; the strengths of the local businesses and the challenges they face; how well the Group's updated culture and values are embedded within the leadership and across the business; and other issues affecting employees.  Conversely, employees have had an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the Board's perspective and areas of interest, and to provide direct feedback on matters of importance to them or their area of the business.",

Following the presentation, the Board discussed and agreed the feedback to the annual College letter.\n\nIn November 2023, members of the Board and the Group Executive Committee (GEC) engaged in discussions with the Regulatory College of Supervisors. This was an important opportunity for members of the Board to engage directly with regulators in the Group's key markets and to hear first hand their concerns and priority areas of focus. Feedback from the Regulatory College of Supervisors will be shared with the Board in 2024.\n\nThe Board received regular updates throughout the year on our significant engagements with the Hong Kong IA and other key regulators.

The strategy is underpinned by three strategic pillars, which are in turn supported by three group-wide enablers.

Discussions cover areas such as capital, risk management, updates on key projects, leadership changes, and governance issues impacting Prudential and the industry.\n\nIn addition, our local businesses communicate and engage with their local regulators as required in order to maintain constructive and open relationships.\n\n## Impact of engagement on Board decision-making and outcomes\n\nFeedback from engagement with the Hong Kong IA drives focus areas for the Risk team and helps shape the annual schedule of business for the Board and its principal committees, in particular the Risk and Audit Committees.\n\nDuring 2023, the Board discussed and approved various matters and documents required under the GWS Framework, including the Group's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment.\n\nWithin the strategy approved by the Board in July 2023, and announced in August, were defined success metrics for each of these key stakeholder groups: customer NPS, employee NPS, financial growth targets, and an updated carbon reduction target. Following the announcement, management undertook an extensive programme of investor engagement to discuss the strategy and its execution; the Chair also engaged investors for their views on the strategy in her annual engagement programme. Management held a series of townhall meetings across our markets to launch the refreshed strategy, purpose and values with employees.\n\nOver 2024, the Board will continue to monitor the execution of the strategy against the agreed success metrics for the different stakeholder groups and a more detailed dashboard of financial and non-financial metrics.",

This engagement helps us to better understand and inform approaches to international and local-level policy and regulations, and to support and contribute to sector and economic developments across the markets in which we operate.\n\nThrough 2023, we benefited from opportunities to meet with governments and policymakers from across Asia and Africa to discuss their priorities, including for insurance and asset management, financial inclusion, climate change and sustainable finance, pandemic recovery, healthcare and technology. An example of local advocacy was Prudential convening industry dialogues on climate health and financial risks in the Philippines with local insurance and financial regulators. Through partnerships with the British Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam and non-profits like the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), Prudential also organised workshops on local transition investment, such as exploring how financing mechanisms like Vietnamese thematic bonds can mobilise capital for the transition to net zero by 2050.\n\n## > For more information, please refer to page 66 of the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Wider communities\n\nOur approach to community investment and engagement is guided by our Group-wide Community Investment Policy and the Group's Sustainability strategy.

The policy also supports compliance with the Hong Kong IA's Group-wide Supervision Outsourcing guidelines.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nPrudential is committed to ensuring that slavery, human trafficking, child labour or any other abuse of human rights has no place in our organisation or supply chain. Management continues to carry out a range of activities to enhance the Group's approach to modern slavery, not least through responsible supplier risk assessments and due diligence requirements within the GTPSO. Our systems include due diligence checks to assess the risk of dealing with a supplier that may be engaged in malpractice. We pay particular attention to low-skilled labour areas which are known 'hot spots' for modern slavery, such as cleaning, catering or guarding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Responsible Supplier Guidelines further promote the development of a sustainable and ethical supply chain, with particular emphasis on conducting due diligence on a service provider's position and compliance with human rights, ethical and safe labour practices and local labour laws and wage standards for spend in categories considered to be of higher risk.\n\n## Payment terms\n\nIn order to demonstrate Prudential's ongoing commitment to supporting its supply chain, Prudential continued to provide payment assistance in 2023 to our small suppliers.\n\nPrudential's standard contractual payment terms in the UK provide for payment to suppliers within 30 days after the invoice date. For smaller suppliers with under 100 employees, our Small Supplier Accelerated Payment Scheme aims to pay suppliers in as little as 10 days after the invoice date.\n\n## Impact of engagement on Board decision-making and outcomes\n\nIn 2023, we further enhanced the GTPSO to drive consistent use of our procurement and third-party risk management system, Coupa, to ensure that our third-party risk management framework is consistently applied. The policy was enhanced by introducing an updated third-party risk assessment methodology that is clearer in identifying elevated risks, strengthens risk monitoring and remediation processes, emphasises market tendering requirements and further clarifies the roles and responsibilities of key functions and stakeholders across the Company.\n\nThrough the introduction of the new Responsible Supplier Guidelines in 2022, Prudential has sought to increasingly introduce the same measures deployed in the UK to our Asia and Africa supply chain. For more information, please refer to our most recent Modern Slavery Statement on our website. We also introduced measures to understand a supplier's position on ethical labour standards, health and safety and equal opportunities for our material suppliers and those that provide services in areas deemed to pose higher modern slavery risks.\n\nWe remain committed to learning how to improve our own due diligence and monitoring and engaged an external party to conduct a review to compare Prudential's best practices to those of other pan-Asian insurers and identify improvements.\n\nIn December 2023, Group Procurement conducted modern slavery risk awareness training in partnership with a non-profit organisation that focuses on these issues. The training provided an overview of modern slavery and raised awareness on where and how these issues may exist in the Group's supply chain, along with how these risks can be mitigated and monitored and the type of positive actions that can be taken to remediate them.\n\nThe Board approved updates to Prudential's Code of Conduct in 2023 and expects that external stakeholders, including suppliers, abide by principles consistent with those of Prudential. Prudential chooses to partner only with those who can meet our rigorous ethical standards.",

We view sustainability as a clear driver of value for our business and society. Our holistic approach involves enhancing the impact of our products and services and shaping the future of sustainability in some of the largest markets in the world. To that end, we are now using the term sustainability as an allencompassing term that signifies the creation of value and growth through the positive impact we are having in our markets.\n\n## Our sustainability purpose and strategy\n\nAs a life and health insurance provider and long-term investor in Asia and Africa, we are committed to playing our part in increasing access to affordable health and financial protection, enabling a just and inclusive transition to a low-carbon future and paving the way to longterm resilience for our customers, people, communities and shareholders.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is core to who we are as a business and our purpose 'For Every Life, For Every Future' speaks to our ambition to deliver real-world impact in the markets where we operate for a more sustainable, responsible and inclusive future.\n\nOur refreshed sustainability strategy is centred on three pillars that reflect who we are as a business. They are simple and accessible health and financial protection, responsible investment and sustainable business. Each pillar has three key priorities that map out our opportunities for impact. Good governance and responsible business practices form the critical foundation across the strategy.\n\nAs guardians of our customers' and shareholders' assets, we consider all material risks, including ESG risks, in fulfilling our fiduciary duty.\n\nOur sustainability strategy actively places the considerations of emerging markets at the forefront, reflecting the needs of many of the markets in which we operate. There is broad recognition of the need to manage the energy transition in a just and inclusive way, yet there is limited emphasis in mainstream discussions on exactly how difficult this process for emerging markets can be. They are currently the largest greenhouse gas emitters, but have historically contributed the least, have the largest financing gaps and are most vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change. With our sustainability strategy we aim to bridge the gap between developed and emerging markets.\n\nAffordability is still a key hurdle for many in emerging markets to access health and financial protection. As a result, we strive to provide more affordable products and solutions to help close the health and protection gaps between emerging and developed markets. By putting our customers at the centre of our product development process, we aim to adapt to changing demographics and meet the evolving needs of our customers.",

'Net zero', in regard to greenhouse gas emissions, refers to a state by which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are reduced as close to zero as possible and any residual emissions are balanced by removals from the atmosphere. When translating these emissions to the activities in the value chain of an organisation, net zero is a state in which the activities of the value chain for an organisation result in net zero greenhouse gas emissions, in a time frame consistent with the Paris Agreement. 2. 'Carbon neutral' for an organisation refers to relying on carbon offsets to balance its value chain's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas net zero refers to prioritising reductions in an organisation's value chain greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible. Only then are any residual emissions balanced by removals from the atmosphere.\n\nThe above performance against targets is as of 31 December 2023. The Board will continue to review and evolve this as the Group progresses on its sustainability journey to consider evolving scientific data and stakeholder expectations.",

The HKEX sets out five reporting principles, which we have addressed as follows:\n\n| Materiality        | The process of materiality assessment  and stakeholder engagement is outlined  in the Materiality assessment section  below.                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Quantitative       | Consistent with our approach in 2022,  metrics have been provided in compliance  with the HKEX requirements and  voluntary adoption of the SASB  Insurance Standard. An index to this  report covers HKEX and SASB Insurance  requirements.                                    |\n| Consistency        | The FY23 report is consistent with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Balance            | We have endeavoured to provide an  unbiased account of our performance  and to use objective presentation  formats.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Reporting boundary | Consistent with previous years, the  scope of the report, and data therein is  available in the Basis of Reporting, and  excludes joint venture partnerships,  notably our joint ventures in India and  China, and the Takaful business in  Malaysia, unless otherwise stated. |\n\nWe have made disclosures consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures (see TCFD index in this Annual Report). In line with our 'comply or explain' obligation under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, we can confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures in this Annual Report. Our TCFD disclosures also meet the new climate-related financial disclosure requirements contained in section 414CB of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn 2023, Prudential continued participating in the Climate Change questionnaire of CDP, scoring B (2022: A-). This was due in part to survey changes, as CDP asks financial institutions to quantify revenue and costs aligned with their climate transition, consistent with strengthening global sustainability reporting framework requirements. To address this moving forward, we are looking to prepare for alignment with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosures (particularly the new S2 Climate Standard), and report on climate-related disclosures through this lens once it becomes mandatory.\n\nIn line with HKEX guidance, the Group has sought limited assurance on select indicators covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 financed emissions, community investment cash contributions and employee diversity as per the prior year. We appointed EY LLP (EY) to provide limited independent assurance over these. EY will be the Group's external auditor from FY2023. In 2023, we also strengthened our internal procedures for verification of our disclosures covering nonfinancial statements to improve the accuracy of our information.\n\n## Rising to the climate challenge\n\nProtecting the future is at the very core of Prudential's purpose: 'For Every Life, For Every Future'. And a future where everyone can thrive relies on limiting the human impact of climate change. Therefore, we are strongly committed to facilitating a just and inclusive net zero transition that fosters sustainable growth and promotes economic wellbeing within the communities we serve. Doing so will involve keeping capital in countries that currently rely heavily on fossil fuels to ensure they have vital funds to invest in lower-carbon transformation.\n\nClimate change is an issue that cuts across all pillars of our sustainability strategy and our business, and we will coordinate our efforts across responsible investment, products and services, engagement and advocacy, and our own operations, to achieve our climate ambitions.\n\nIn March 2023, we published our first Climate Transition Plan. It sets out our approach to fulfilling our climate-related commitments and details the specific actions we will take and the metrics that will guide us on the path to net zero. Updates to our Climate Transition Plan are integrated within the Responsible investment and Sustainable business sections of the Sustainability Report 2023. Both the Sustainability Report and Annual Report contain an index to show alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Further climate-related information in this report\n\n| > TCFD disclosures, pages 119                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|\n| > TCFD reference tables, pages 137              |\n| > Responsible investment information, pages 110 |\n| > Environmental metrics, pages 126              |",

In 2022, we carried out a robust materiality assessment based on structured stakeholder engagement. This included formal surveys and interviews with customers, distributors and employees. Via this process, we explored a range of issues, risks and opportunities, focusing on where we can create positive impact through our products, services and initiatives.

The topics are mapped according to their importance to stakeholders and Prudential's business, and their impact on the economy, environment and society.

It recognises the major role that Prudential can continue to play in shaping sustainability across Asia and Africa, as well as in ensuring the long-term success, resilience and health of the communities in which we operate. As such sustainability matters, including climate change, are overseen by the Board, which is responsible for determining overall strategy and prioritisation of key focus areas.\n\nThe Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG) comprises only independent Non-executive Directors and focuses on customer, culture, digital, people and community matters. The Risk Committee oversees environmental and climate-related issues, including the implementation of the Group's commitments to decarbonise its operations and investment portfolio and other climate-focused responsible investment commitments. The Committee is also responsible for external reporting, via the Sustainability Report, where it relates to those areas within its remit, including monitoring progress on the Group's reporting against the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nThe Risk Committee has a standing item on its agenda in relation to its oversight of climate change, including progress against our climate targets. In setting future targets or commitments, the Risk Committee considers and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board. The remit of the Risk Committee also includes considering climate-related issues when reviewing and guiding overall strategy, major plans of action, risk management policies, annual budgets and business plans.\n\nIn 2024, the Board plans to establish a Sustainability Committee to replace the RSWG and to take over from the Risk Committee oversight of environmental and climate-related issues. The Committee will be chaired by Non-executive Director, George Sartorel.\n\nSince 2022, sustainability has been included in the strategic priorities for the Group's Executive Directors by way of a specific objective to drive the climate transition and responsible investment focus across the organisation. To support this ambition, the Remuneration Committee has adopted a transition finance underpin target for this element of the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan (PLTIP). This underpin will consider the value of qualifying investments committed to support the transition of the world to a lower-carbon future.\n\nIn line with our updated target to reduce emissions from all shareholder and policyholder assets by 55 per cent by 2030, in December 2023 the Remuneration Committee agreed to attach carbon reduction targets to Executive Directors' 2024 Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan (PLTIP) awards, making this the third cycle of awards with carbon reduction targets. Sustainability metrics constitute 10 per cent of the total Executive Directors' 2024 PLTIP award, including 5 per cent linked to carbon reduction and 5 per cent linked to diversity.\n\n> Further information regarding both measures can be found in the Directors' remuneration report within the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Management oversight\n\nSustainability activities, including the impacts of climate change, are overseen at a management level by the Group Sustainability Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Committee, which met five times in 2023. The Committee's members include the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and senior representatives from the Group's asset owner and asset management businesses, including the chief executives of Eastspring and Prudential Singapore's business.\n\nOne of the Group Sustainability Committee's responsibilities is to oversee the Group's progress towards fulfilling our commitment to report against the recommendations of the TCFD.

As a large asset owner and manager focused on Africa and Asia, we are keenly aware that emerging markets face unique challenges as they seek to decarbonise. Typically, they are more reliant on fossil fuels than developed markets, while having pressing social and development needs to meet, making it very difficult for them to meet global decarbonisation thresholds.\n\nOur 2022 'Just and Inclusive Transition' paper outlines the issues we want to help address through responsible investment. Currently, most global responsible investment frameworks do not differentiate between emerging and developed markets - applying the same standards and thresholds to both, despite the different risks and challenges they face. This is a barrier to much-needed investment to finance the transition and not in line with the 'common but differentiated principle' of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe want to use the scale and position to drive positive change by ensuring the needs of emerging markets are considered in our investment decisions. Our approach to responsible investment is built around three key themes:\n\n- - Financing a just and inclusive transition;\n- - Decarbonising our portfolio; and\n- - Mainstreaming responsible investments in emerging markets.\n\nOur efforts are informed by our Climate Transition Plan, which sets out our long-term net zero pledge and interim targets. We have made good progress towards our own decarbonisation, but recognise the opportunities to be proactive in enabling the transition to a lowercarbon economy for emerging markets in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeveloped\n\n## new internal investment target\n\non financing the transition, as an underpin to the WACI reduction target\n\n## Anchor investor of the largest equity ETF\n\n## fund in Singapore\n\n(at time of launch) - iShares MSCI Asia ex Japan Climate Action ETF\n\n875\n\nCorporate engagements conducted in 2023\n\n## 87%\n\nof Eastspring's international funds (SICAV) received Article 8* status\n\n- * Under the European Union Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, Article 8 refers to funds that promote investments or projects with positive or social qualities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpgraded our WACI\n\nreduction target from 25% to\n\n55%\n\nby 2030\n\nOngoing engagement with the companies responsible for\n\n65%\n\nof the absolute emissions in our investment portfolio\n\nEastspring voted in\n\n97.2%\n\nof proxy votes for which it was eligible to vote",

        "page_content": "## Financing a just and inclusive transition\n\nPrudential's efforts and commitment to reach net zero by 2050 are aligned with science and the Paris Agreement. At the same time, operating in a breadth of markets across Asia and Africa demands a considered and dynamic approach to the low-carbon transition. The climate-related risks and opportunities in developed markets with diversified and mature economies are very different to those in emerging markets. This can be seen in the large divergence between countries and regions in their efforts and ability to act on climate change by reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nSome of the countries that remain the most carbon-intensive are those least likely to be able to fund the transition to lower-carbon technologies and practices. There is a lack of industry standards relating to transition finance. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets cannot typically meet the high decarbonisation thresholds set by developed markets as they are at very different stages of economic development. As a result, emerging markets are underrepresented in climate-related investment strategies because existing frameworks have created a bias against investing in them. Shifting capital away from regions where transition financing is most needed hampers not only the climate transition, but also social and economic growth in these regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategy on financing the transition seeks to use our capital to advance a just and inclusive transition. It recognises that Singapore and Hong Kong are well placed to lead climate transition in Asia, while emerging markets will take a longer time to transition. For example in developed markets, the focus lies on financing green energy solutions. In many emerging markets in Asia, finding ways to finance the phase-out of carbon-intensive assets, like coal plants, has the potential to achieve significant absolute carbon reductions. Therefore, our strategy also identifies categories across the transition spectrum, including both 'green' and 'brown-to-green' investments, allowing us to pinpoint opportunities to finance companies through their transition.\n\n## Decarbonising our portfolio\n\nLocal context is a key consideration in our assessment of how best to enable the transition to a low-carbon future. We believe moving capital away from carbon-intensive companies in emerging markets will make it more difficult for these regions to transition to a lowercarbon future. To support a just transition, we acknowledge that we will need to accept a higher initial baseline for some companies and explore and implement a wider variety of strategies to achieve net zero.\n\nIn May 2021, we committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for our investment portfolio. We also resolved to reduce emissions intensity within our investment portfolio by 25 per cent by 2025. At the end of 2023, we had successfully reduced the weighted average carbon intensity of our investment portfolio by 50 per cent from our 2019 baseline. Based on this strong progress, in August 2023 we revised our WACI target upwards, committing to deliver a 55 per cent reduction in the carbon intensity of our investment portfolio by 2030, compared with our 2019 baseline.\n\nDecarbonising our portfolio remains a priority, but our progress in reducing our WACI is unlikely to be linear. It can be influenced by a range of market factors that could cause the WACI to rise or fall. We might also decide intentionally to invest in a carbon-intensive company to support and enable its transition plans.\n\nOur strategy to finance the transition aims to actively support carbonintensive companies on the implementation of their transition plans from brown to green. While this will make our decarbonisation pathway more volatile, our interim targets align to a 1.5\u00b0C degree pathway.",

It also gives us the opportunity to understand the range of issues and structural challenges these economies face in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. As an active member of global initiatives such as the UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), we contribute by providing a voice on behalf of these markets.\n\n## Corporate engagement\n\nWe work closely with our investee companies to support their transition to a net zero business model. Each year, we have committed to engage with the companies responsible for 65 per cent of the emissions related to our investment portfolio, which is aligned to the recommendations of the NZAOA. By addressing key topics such as improving disclosure, setting net zero and decarbonisation targets, adapting business models, and financing green projects - our goal is to encourage them to accelerate their progress.\n\n## Voting to drive change\n\nVoting is a crucial element of being an active shareholder and an important opportunity to influence a company. Eastspring's voting and engagement activities are closely aligned when seeking to change a company's actions or approach.\n\nEastspring engages Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a fellow signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), to provide administrative assistance in connection with voting proxies. These services include vote processing and recommendations. Eastspring reviews these recommendations and decides whether to follow or vote differently.\n\nShareholders' long-term interests are paramount, so Eastspring does not always support company management and may vote against management from time to time. In 2023, Eastspring voted on 97.2 per cent of proxy votes in which it was eligible to vote. Eastspring voted with management recommendations on 89.4 per cent of these, and voted against management recommendations on 10.6 per cent of these.\n\n## Responsible investment governance\n\nTo oversee our responsible investment activities and monitor our progress towards our commitments, we have established a robust governance framework.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nBoard committee that reviews the Group's material risk exposures, and monitors the Group's reporting against the recommendations of the TCFD\n\n## Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG)\n\nBoard-level working group that oversees embedding the Group's sustainability strategy\n\n## Group Sustainability Committee\n\nResponsible for assessing sustainability matters holistically at Group level\n\n## Group Investment Committee (GIC)\n\nOversees Group-wide investment performance and risk exposures, including those impacting policyholders\n\nMembers include asset manager CEO, CIO and Chief Actuary\n\n## Group Responsible Investment Working Group (GRIWG)\n\nOversees all responsible investment activity across the Group.\n\nIn 2024, the Board plans to establish a Sustainability Committee to replace the RSWG.\n\n## Responsible investment approach\n\nManaging ESG risks by applying our Responsible Investment Policy is part of our effort to generate long-term returns on assets. The policy sets out clear criteria for screening investment portfolios to identify and assess sustainability-related risks, and processes for ongoing corporate engagement. To address priority themes, such as decarbonisation, human rights and biodiversity, we have identified criteria for excluding companies involved in certain activities.\n\nLooking ahead, we are increasing our focus on preventing biodiversity loss. Our asset managers screen for exposure to palm oil producers that are not certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We require engagement with consumers to raise awareness around the benefits of paying more for sustainable palm oil to ensure producers in emerging markets have an incentive and funding for their transition to more sustainable production. We also review the portfolio for companies that produce or depend on commodities that contribute to deforestation, particularly timber extraction, engaging with them at least annually to assess their exposure.",

For example in 2023,  Prudential Taiwan altered its benchmark to the MSCI USA ESG Enhanced Focus CTB (Climate  Transition Benchmark) to align more closely with Prudential's responsible investment priorities  and more mature ESG markets of Europe and the United States.   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                               | Eastspring has integrated ESG considerations into its fund manager screening, due diligence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Step 2:                       | and ongoing monitoring processes, to ensure underlying managers are aligned to our Group  ESG requirements.

We have developed a new people and culture strategy to create an environment where our talent can grow and maintain a high-performance culture for longterm resilience.\n\nOur people want to be part of an organisation that is socially responsible and guided by a strong purpose. To ensure we can keep attracting and retaining talented individuals to serve our business today and in the future, we have strengthened our focus on rewarding high performance and creating an outstanding employee experience.\n\nOur leaders are driven by our values and nurture a culture that fully understands who we intend to be and how putting our people and customers at the heart of everything we do will help us win. We will invest further in developing the capabilities of our workforce, through strategic talent acquisition and internal talent development.\n\n## > Find out more in the Empowering our people section of our Sustainability Report.\n\n## Culture\n\nAn important step towards embedding our new business strategy was the launch of the PruWay - the fundamental values, shaped by our employees, which define who we are and what we represent. The PruWay defines new ways of working with one another and delivering value for all our stakeholders - our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities.\n\nAt Prudential, we are looking to transform our employee experience and ensure our people can visualise their career progression at Prudential,\n\nwhile developing the strategic skills we need to build the business. This goes beyond performance and considers their future potential.\n\nAs stated in the Sustainability governance section earlier, the Boardlevel Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG) oversees sustainability topics including culture and people. In 2023, we switched to conducting shorter employee engagement surveys to enable us to gain regular feedback and respond quickly to emerging issues across markets. This approach allows our people to provide timely feedback and for us to detect early warning signs, track actions and measure impact against key people metrics. A full people survey is scheduled for the second half of 2024.\n\n## Capability\n\nA priority of our people strategy is to build a pipeline of adaptive leaders with both depth and breadth of capabilities. This will prime our 200 leaders to confidently respond to future challenges, while continuing to navigate existing challenges. To equip our employees with necessary skills for the future, we offer them a learning experience that includes e-learning, in-person and virtual classroom training and mentoring.\n\n## Talent vitality\n\nWe are focused on building a robust succession pipeline for our CEOs and GLT members to ensure organisation resilience and leadership sustainability. Succession plans for CEOs and GLT members are reviewed regularly and discussed at the Group Talent Council.\n\nFor our people, we want them to be able to build long and rewarding careers at Prudential. Promoting internal mobility is one way that we demonstrate our commitment to creating an environment where talented individuals can thrive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Ambition        | Create an environment where talent thrives and powers growth          | Create an environment where talent thrives and powers growth                 |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strategic goals | Culture A winning spirit that is customer- led and performance-driven | Talent vitality A robust succession pipeline and  dynamic talent marketplace |\n| Priorities      |                                                                       |                                                                              |\n|                 | Values-driven leadership                                              | Succession                                                                   |\n|                 | Belonging                                                             | Mobility                                                                     |\n|                 | Employee experience                                                   | Diversity                                                                    |",

        "page_content": "The privacy controls put in place continue to be effective, but further enhancement in managing employees and vendors is a key initiative for 2024. Regular internal and external privacy and security audits are carried out as and when needed, and we work closely with regulators to ensure this works effectively. We conduct monthly scanning of our external environment for vulnerabilities, and all public-facing applications undergo penetration testing, including vulnerability assessments as part of the application launch. They are also regularly reviewed as part of our governance process.\n\n## Privacy\n\nAs a business with a large global footprint, Prudential must navigate a number of privacy laws. Our Group Privacy Policy sets out the standard of privacy expected across our businesses and ensures that we handle personal data in compliance with regulatory requirements and in line with customer and employee expectations, while also meeting the demands of a competitive commercial organisation. For more information on our data and privacy policy, please visit our Company website: Policies and statements - Prudential plc.\n\n## Responsible procurement practices\n\nWe endeavour to make sure our suppliers apply the same high standards that we aspire to achieve, which is driven by our Group Third-Party Supply and Outsourcing (GTPSO) Policy. This forms part of our Group Governance Manual (GGM) and is a core part of our system of governance. The policy sets out our position on supply chain management, outlining our approach to due diligence, selection criteria, contractual requirements and ongoing monitoring of our supplier relationships.\n\n## Responsible environmental practices\n\nTo help improve the lives of our customers and communities, we actively seek to reduce our environmental impact. We measure our environmental performance so that we can understand our impact and take appropriate actions.\n\nThe way we manage our property footprint aligns with our Group Environment Policy, which covers environmental laws and regulations for emissions, energy consumption, water use, waste disposal, environmental supply chain management and the application of risk management principles. During 2023, all our local business units were issued with updated environmental roadmaps, detailing their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, their 2030 target, and the actions that businesses have committed to over the next three years to reduce their emissions.\n\nOur global absolute Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions were 14,426 tCO2e, down 22 per cent from 2022, primarily driven through the benefit of green power and renewable energy procurement. Electricity use in our buildings is the largest contributor to our operational footprint at 12,318 tCO2e (market-based), making up 85 per cent of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nWe continue to focus on driving down our operational energy consumption to reduce emissions through a range of initiatives and policies. When creating new working environments, we take the opportunity to implement best practice environmental performance features from the outset. These include LED lighting, automated lighting controls, lighting zones and climate controls.\n\n- > Read more in the Responsible environmental practices section of our Sustainability Report.\n\n## Responsible working practices and health and safety procedures\n\nOur Group Resilience Policy and Health and Safety Standards is integral to the way we manage operations in all business units. We operate a risk-driven health and safety management process that seeks to ensure the best working environment. We prioritise the prevention of injury and ill health and the reduction of health and safety risks to employees, contractors, visitors and any others who may be affected by our business operations.\n\nWe aim to ensure that our health and safety management processes meet and exceed regulatory and statutory requirements, and we follow best practice where possible.\n\n- > Read more in the Establishing sustainable operations and value chain section of our Sustainability Report.\n\n## Harnessing thought leadership to shape the agenda\n\nWe are actively involved in advocating for emerging market sustainability and climate-related concerns on a global level, beyond exploring the role that investors can play in enabling a just and inclusive transition. We also engage with policy and regulatory stakeholders to promote awareness of sustainability issues, focusing on regulatory reform, blended finance, alignment of standards and taxonomies and nature preservation.\n\nOne focus of our research and advocacy efforts is the intersection of climate and health. Climate change has the potential to significantly impact human health, particularly from air pollutants and increasing temperatures. Through research partnerships, we strive to help people around the world prepare for such changes and better protect their health and livelihoods.\n\n- > Find out more in the Harnessing thought leadership to shape the agenda section of our Sustainability Report.",

In addition to responsible investment approaches designed to address climate-related challenges, our Climate Transition Plan sets out how we will fulfil our climate-related commitments and we have included updates against the plan throughout this report. We have also included an index to show how this report aligns with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Oversight of climate change\n\nAt a management level, sustainability, including climate-related responsibilities and progress towards fulfilling the TCFD recommendations, is overseen by the Group Sustainability Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The Sustainability Committee reports to the Board-level Risk Committee, which has ultimate oversight of environmental and climate-related issues.\n\nThe Risk Committee has a standing agenda item relating to the oversight of climate change, including the progress against the Group's climate targets, updates on principal risks including climaterelated risk and consideration of climate-related issues when reviewing and guiding overall strategy, major plans of action, risk management policies, annual budgets and business plans. The Risk Committee is also responsible for external reporting, via the Sustainability Report, where it relates to those areas within its remit, including the TCFD disclosures. In setting future climate targets or commitments, the Risk Committee considers and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board. The Committee receives updates on climate-related issues at least twice each year, and in 2023 it was updated four times.\n\nIn 2024, the Board plans to establish a Sustainability Committee to replace the RSWG and to take over responsibility for the oversight of climate change from the Risk Committee.\n\n- > For more information on the governance of climate-related risk, please refer to the Sustainability governance section of the Sustainability Report,  which details our sustainability and climaterelated governance.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe regularly analyse and assess the potential impact of the risks associated with climate change to ensure we can continue to serve our customers and strengthen our business resilience. Our Group Risk Framework (GRF) considers both emerging and significant risks, including those related to sustainability themes. Sustainability risks, including climate-related risks, are considered principal risks at the Group level and consequently receive enhanced management focus and reporting.\n\n## Identifying climate-related risks\n\nClimate-related risks are considered within our risk management processes to assess their importance relative to other risks. We continue to treat climate risk as a thematic cross-cutting risk type, with the potential to impact or amplify multiple existing risks that we manage. By treating climate-related risks as a cross-cutting risk type, we recognise that there could be significant interdependencies with, and impacts on, other established stand-alone risks, including credit, market, insurance and operational risks. We also recognise that the risks associated with sustainability topics, including climate change, may exhibit a number of additional risk characteristics which are not explicitly recognised in more traditional risk management practices and frameworks. Consequently, the following risk characteristics associated with climate and other sustainability themes are considered in our risk management framework:\n\n| Sustainability risk  characteristics   | Considerations                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Longer time horizons                   | Some aspects of ESG/sustainability risks  may emerge in the near term, while  others may develop over a much longer  time period than traditional risks. |\n| Double materiality                     | The Company can be both 'impacted  by' ESG/sustainability issues, and have  an 'impact on' those issues.                                                 |\n| Dynamic materiality                    | A topic can rapidly change from being  immaterial to material.                                                                                           |\n| Multiple stakeholders                  | The Company's actions can impact a  wide range of stakeholders including  employees, customers, communities and  the environment.                        |",

Our emerging risk process helps us identify and adapt to evolving climate change and sustainability topics across our business.\n\nUnderstanding our exposure to climate-related risks in key markets in Asia is an ongoing priority for us and we engage with the risk teams within key local businesses on the climate-related topics most relevant to those markets, including TCFD-aligned pillars such as internal governance, local strategy, risk management integration, and metrics/ targets. This enables the local businesses to share knowledge and experience and leverage the Group experience, and enables a consistent approach to addressing climate-related risks to be adopted across our markets.\n\nClimate change's impact is evolving quickly, with new risks and developments emerging constantly. We help our local businesses understand the potential implications of climate-related risks and work with them to navigate and comply with the changing regulatory landscape, for instance in Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia.\n\n## Identifying and responding to climate-related opportunities\n\nWe are strengthening the climate resilience of our portfolios and adopting a considered approach to assessing carbon intensity within our investments. We are also continuing to incorporate climate change considerations into our products and services.\n\nAs a substantial investor and asset owner with long-term investment horizons and obligations, we actively pursue opportunities to invest in financing mechanisms associated with climate mitigation and resilience. As an insurer focused on life, health and wealth products, we also consider the opportunities presented to better serve our customers who may experience climate-related impacts.\n\nSome categories that we are currently looking to explore or expand include:\n\n- - Financing mechanisms, such as green bonds, transition financing and adaptation financing;\n- - Savings and insurance products, like ESG- or impact-focused investments and climate-related health and protection offerings, such as those that consider changes in the frequency, severity and emergence of diseases exacerbated by climate change, like dengue fever; and\n- - Engaging, educating and supporting our customers and employees to build an understanding of sustainability and climate change.\n\nAcross our markets, we look for ways to strengthen the climate resilience of our investment portfolios. In Singapore, we partnered with BlackRock and SGX Group to anchor the largest equity exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Singapore (at time of launch), the iShares MSCI Asia ex-Japan Climate Action ETF.\n\nIn select markets, Prudential also offers ways for local clients to invest more sustainably, while growing capital in the long term.

        "page_content": "Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe recognise the importance of not only identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, but also considering the potential impacts on our business, and the resilience of our strategy to climate-related changes, developments and uncertainties across a range of climate scenarios.\n\n## Climate-related scenario analysis\n\nScenario testing is a valuable tool for enhancing understanding of climate-related risks and improving decision-making. It is particularly beneficial in raising awareness of climate change risks, due to the broad range and uncertain timing of potential mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\nWe closely monitor and evaluate advances in climate scenario testing, including reviewing publications from regulators, global organisations like the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), as well as reports from the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n## Overview of our climate scenarios\n\nTo support engagement with Group and local business regulators, we carefully considered the scenario methodologies appropriate to the size, nature and complexity of our organisation. Since we first began using scenario testing, we have become more sophisticated in applying different scenarios based on specific business needs:\n\n- - NGFS scenarios (orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hothouse world) are used for stress testing the resiliency of our balance sheet;\n- - PRI scenarios, including the forecast policy scenario, assess the economic impact of likely policy developments and inform central market assumptions; and\n- - IPCC, IEA, and TPI provide science-based decarbonisation pathways aligned with Paris Agreement goals, that can support investee engagement to drive real-world change.\n\n## NGFS-aligned scenarios\n\nStress testing on our balance sheet is conducted under NGFS-aligned scenarios, with risks assessed over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. These scenarios offer insight into the potential financial implications of the different pathways and can simulate complex interactions between energy, economy and climate systems, considering both policy and technology developments. We use data from external providers who have adjusted the calibration of the scenarios to employ non-equilibrium economic models to reflect realworld inefficiencies.\n\n## Carbon prices used in scenario analysis\n\nCarbon prices are used as a proxy for the impact of potential government climate policies within our climate scenario analysis. These prices are set to reflect differences across the regions where we operate and consider local market dynamics.\n\nIn the long term, we expect the introduction of carbon prices and carbon taxes to increase, as governments look for tools to combat emissions. Imposing an internal carbon price (ICP) has been considered as a means of establishing consistency in how carbonrelated factors are considered across our organisation.\n\nThe three NGFS-aligned scenarios used in our stress testing are as follows:\n\n- - Orderly transition: This <2\u00b0C scenario aligns with the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6. Under this scenario, ambitious climate policies are introduced, reducing fossil fuel demand, implementing higher carbon taxes, and investing in low-carbon electricity generation and manufacturing. Despite emissions reductions, extreme weather events increase, leading to physical loss and damages.\n- - Disorderly transition: This <2\u00b0C scenario assumes similar transition policies and physical impacts as the orderly transition scenario, but with delayed and disorderly policy implementation. Market volatility rises, especially in fossilfuel-intensive sectors and regions, as well as across all sectors due to the disorderly nature of policy introduction.\n- - Hothouse world: This scenario forecasts a >4\u00b0C temperature increase by 2100. It anticipates irreversible climate damage, extreme weather events and water shortages in line with RCP 8.5. Some areas experience warming above 4\u00b0C, rendering them unsuitable for agriculture and habitation. Few additional climate policies are implemented, resulting in limited transition impacts.\n\nWhile we see benefits in the use of forward-looking data, particularly in supporting the assessment of how well companies are prepared for the climate transition, it is important to acknowledge the limitations. These limitations include but are not limited to data quality, data availability, data consistency, underestimation of physical climate risk, model limitations, greater uncertainties over longer time horizons, and the need for extensive judgements and assumptions.  In addition, current climate models do not capture tail events such as climate tipping points (eg ice sheet melt, Amazon dieback) or knock-on effects (eg migration, war, political and social instability) that could have significant impacts on global economies. As a result, we treat forward-looking climate data with more caution than other decision-useful metrics like historical financial statements.",

The results of our climate scenario stress testing have allowed us to arrive at two conclusions with respect to our balance sheet:\n\n- - Though the Group faces potential financial risks from plausible global responses to climate change, the results of our scenario testing are not outside observed market volatility, suggesting no immediate need for explicit climate change considerations within current valuations of our investment portfolio;\n- - Furthermore, explicitly including additional stresses for climate change in our internal economic capital adequacy model is not needed currently.\n\nThe results are documented in the Group's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) report, which is regularly shared with the Board.\n\nThe results are simplified in ways which enable understanding and comparison: for example a static balance sheet is used, and the potential sectoral and regional impacts are summarised at a high level. We understand that these simplifications could result in understating exposures and vulnerabilities, as acknowledged by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and NGFS. We remain mindful of these limitations when referring to the results of the scenario testing.\n\nAdditionally, our climate scenario analysis currently does not consider potential management actions we could take to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. However, we recognise the need to explore these opportunities in the future. At this stage, given these models have evolved considerably and continue to change, we do not consider the climate scenario tests suitable for setting capital requirements.\n\n## Impacts on assets\n\nAs a significant asset owner and manager, we rely on investment returns to meet long-term liabilities. This leaves us vulnerable to any risks that could disrupt or diminish investment returns, and we explore these risks under each climate scenario.\n\nThe 'disorderly transition' scenario showed the most significant impact in the short to medium term as markets adjusted to disorderly policy changes. As expected, the 'orderly transition' scenario had the least overall impact on the Group's balance sheet. This reinforces our strategic objective of decarbonising our investment portfolio. The 'hothouse world' scenario considers long-term physical climate change impacts that could lead to financial market repercussions in the medium to long term.  While the impact of the 'hothouse world' scenario are muted in the short to medium term, it had the largest overall impact on the Group's balance sheet over the long term, reinforcing the message that investors should not be misled into a false sense of security of maintaining current government policies, as the true cost of climate change compounds over much longer time horizons.\n\nThe scenario analysis reveals important insight into how the different scenarios might impact different sectors, as shown in the heatmap diagram below.\n\nIn the 'orderly transition' scenario, the impact is confined to three sectors: fossil-based utilities, coal and manufactured fuels, and oil and gas. In contrast, under the 'disorderly transition' scenario, the impact extends beyond the three sectors highlighted.\n\nThese sectoral impacts are significant to Prudential, given our operational footprint across Asia and Africa, with many countries engaged in manufacturing rather than service industries. Both scenarios also present investment opportunities in clean energy and water supply.\n\n|                                           | Orderly transition   | Orderly transition   | Orderly transition   | Disorderly transition   | Disorderly transition   | Disorderly transition   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Sectors                                   | 2025                 | 2035                 | 2050                 | 2025                    | 2035                    | 2050                    |\n| Financials                                |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Information technology                    |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Consumer staples                          |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Consumer discretionary                    |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Industrials                               |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Communication services                    |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Materials                                 |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Real estate                               |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Healthcare                                |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Oil and gas                               |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Fossil-based utilities                    |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Coal and manufactured fuels               |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Public administrative and defence         |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Education                                 |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Other low-carbon and biobased electricity |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Water supply                              |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Wind and solar                            |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Nuclear                                   |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n| Forestry                                  |                      |                      |                      |                         |                         |                         |\n\nSource: Prudential internal scenario analysis work",

        "page_content": "Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\n\n## Impact on strategic asset allocation\n\nIn addition to climate scenario analysis, we integrate climate change into our strategic asset allocation (SAA) process. The SAA process heavily relies on capital market assumptions (CMAs), which are economic projections used across our financial metrics and asset classes. We use CMAs that are particularly focused on the countries where we operate and invest.\n\nThese CMAs are developed through a rigorous process that incorporates comprehensive research, economic models and projections of key drivers of economic variables. To ensure climate risk is captured within our CMAs, we include climate data, such as climaterelated transition and physical risks.\n\nWe have partnered with an external provider to assess a climate scenario and associated potential impacts on our CMAs. This evaluation will be conducted twice a year to ensure the CMAs remain relevant. We will also continually review our data and findings, considering the higher levels of uncertainty typically experienced by emerging markets.\n\n## Regional impact on our operations\n\nAs extreme weather increases in frequency, our people and our operations are potentially exposed to physical risks associated with climate change. Strengthening our organisational resilience to these risks is a key priority for us.\n\nWe use a third-party platform to assess the risks associated with natural disasters and inform our business continuity management approach. The most recent assessment revealed potential significant physical climate impacts to our operations under the 'hothouse scenario' (RCP 8.5) as shown on the map.\n\nWe also use scenario analysis to identify additional vulnerabilities in our operations, supply chains and customer base. Using our thirdparty provider's platform, we also investigate the potential operational risks from severe typhoons or floods, including property damage, business interruption and market volatility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact on financial and strategic planning\n\nWe review our strategy and financial planning process annually and stress-test the proposed strategy to assess its resilience. These stress tests, which are conducted as part of our usual business activities and consider stresses independent of climate change, are more stringent than the scenarios outlined in the Climate-related scenario analysis section. The results of these business stress tests, combined with the insights gained from the climate-scenario testing, provide us with additional confidence in the strategy's viability for the year ahead.\n\nWe also ask our local businesses to consider our sustainability strategy and Responsible Investment Policy in their product development processes and ongoing product evaluations.",

        "page_content": "## Impact on access to capital\n\nOccasionally, we seek to raise capital from bond or equity markets to fund strategic opportunities like mergers, acquisitions or new market entry. Institutional investors are our primary source of capital, and we expect them to continue to provide access to sufficient capital despite potential impacts of climate change.\n\nOur credit ratings remain high, based on credit rating agencies' assessment of our business profile and financial flexibility, including capital market access. ESG factors are regularly discussed in our annual meetings with ratings agencies. To date, they have not impacted our creditworthiness.\n\n## Impacts on insurance liabilities\n\nPotential climate change impacts may also affect morbidity, mortality and persistency differently across global regions. These differences are captured in the annual review process that monitors these factors and considers their impact on our products. As a life and health insurer, while we recognise the potential for climate change and government policies to impact the assumptions underlying our underwriting liabilities, we believe there is currently insufficiency of and uncertainty in data that would allow us to reliably use the assumptions for the valuation of our underwriting liabilities.\n\nTherefore, at this stage, the Group's assumptions for our life and health insurance business do not include additional assumptions related to the impacts of climate change. We will continue to engage with our regular experience analysis, to engage with reinsurers and monitor relevant academic studies. If significant changes occur, the financial impacts of climate-related risks on insurance liabilities will be considered. Additionally, we have analysed the distribution of our customers across locations to assess their vulnerability to extreme climate events. These assessments aim to improve our understanding of our customers', and our, exposure to climate risks.\n\n## Advocating for emerging market sustainability and climate-related issues\n\nWe are actively involved in advocating for emerging market sustainability and climate-related concerns on a global level. Our advocacy efforts extend beyond exploring the role of investors in a just and inclusive transition in Asia and Africa. We also engage with policy and regulatory stakeholders to promote awareness of sustainability issues. Our outreach focuses on key themes, including regulatory reform, blended finance, harmonisation of standards and taxonomies, and the preservation of nature. We also continue to explore the impacts of climate change on health through research partnerships. It is critical that policymakers and communities have the knowledge and tools to support them with climate change adaptation efforts.\n\n## Evolving our climate actions\n\nClimate change is a fast-moving issue, with new challenges and solutions emerging all the time. We are continually looking to improve our understanding of the challenges we face and the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate them.\n\nAs outlined in the Rising to the climate challenge section above, we plan to continue devising and executing renewed climate action at Prudential. We are already mapping a clearer trajectory on our journey to net zero and identifying opportunities to drive positive change across our business and customer interfaces, as well as our operations and our supply chains.\n\nTo safeguard our customers from the impacts of climate change and build resilience for the future, we will continue to update our climate transition actions and progress, aiming to make more proactive contributions to a just and inclusive net zero transition across our broad footprint in Asia and Africa. Broadly, we will seek to:\n\n- - Work with data providers and our asset managers to improve the availability and quality of our Scope 3 investment book data, including potential monitoring of other asset classes as methodologies continue to develop;\n- - Develop the coverage of our Scope 3 value chain emissions beyond financed emissions, for example our supply chain emissions and initiatives to reduce them;\n- - Investigate the feasibility of setting net zero operational targets, in light of the constraints of renewable energy availability within our markets;\n- - Examine how emerging topics, such as nature and biodiversity, may impact our decarbonisation strategy and our overall approach to climate change;\n- - Continue to explore climate-related opportunities, such as those relating to climate financing within emerging markets, our customers and digital services, climate-related health products and services, and employee initiatives;\n- - Further develop our approach to corporate engagement and asset manager engagement, focusing on appropriate sector-specific and emerging market engagement approaches to maximise our impact;\n- - Continue to develop localised, market-specific responsible investment approaches;\n- - Explore additional opportunities to collaborate and partner with relevant private and public entities on climate change and transition financing; and\n- - Continue to engage with other financial market participants, local regulators and stakeholders to advance the development of frameworks that support our climate work in emerging markets.\n\n## Climate-related targets and metrics\n\nOur long-term pledge is to become net zero by 2050, and we have established interim targets to measure our progress on the path to net zero. These targets are designed to support the achievement of the Paris Agreement goals to limit the increase in global average temperatures to 1.5\u02daC above pre-industrial levels.\n\nSince our carbon journey began in 2018, we have continually reviewed our approach and our commitments to assess our progress towards our net zero pledge. We have met or exceeded our interim targets at every stage, allowing us to increase our ambitions and update our targets to accelerate our progress.",

Absolute emissions allow us to quantify the overall carbon footprint of investments within our portfolio, while WACI data allows us to compare carbon footprints relative to the revenue generated by investments.\n\nMeasuring WACI enables us to compare the intensity of emissions for different portfolios and assess improvements over time. WACI is also useful as a proxy for transition risk within our investment portfolio, with a higher WACI usually indicating a gap in alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs mentioned in the Challenges and future goals section of the report, the calculation of WACI is aligned to the protocol of the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance as follows:\n\n- - Assets from wholly-owned business only;\n- - Shareholder and policyholder assets (excluding assets in unit-linked funds);\n- - Assets in the following asset classes only: listed equities and classified corporate bonds, using industry practice;\n- - Assets in the following investment vehicles: segregated mandates, collective investment schemes and exchange traded funds.\n\nThese assets mentioned above, as reported by our main portfolio management system, constitutes over 92.9 per cent of our investment portfolio as at 30 September 2022.\n\nTo assess our operational emissions, we measure the reduction in emissions intensity per full-time employee.\n\n## Carbon emissions profile as of 31 December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) (tCO2e)                                                                                                                                   | 14,425*    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Scope 3 - including emissions associated  with fuel- and energy-related activities,  waste generated in operations and business  travel, excluding category 15 (tCO2e) | 14,462*    |\n| Scope 3 category 15 - including emissions  associated with investments (tCO2e)                                                                                         | 3,600,000* |\n\n- * Within the scope of EY assurance - for further information, see the the Basis of Reporting which notes those Scope 3 categories that were within the scope of EY assurance.",

To enhance data availability, we are working with both data providers and our asset managers to improve disclosures. In time, we expect the situation to improve as companies across regions are increasingly required to make climate-related disclosures and face increased scrutiny from stakeholders.\n\nWe are aware that expanding data coverage could impact the WACI of our portfolio, either positively or negatively, as newly disclosed data is included in our calculations.\n\nFor more detail on our direct environmental footprint, please refer to the Sustainable business section of the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Forward-looking metrics\n\nWe are actively working with our asset management and asset owner businesses to develop forward-looking metrics that are more suitable for our operations. These metrics would enable us to effectively manage and report on climate-related risks, while integrating seamlessly with our investment processes to help us uphold our responsible investment framework.\n\nIn assessing new metrics, we have conducted a thorough review of peer practices and industry recommendations regarding forwardlooking metrics, including Climate Value at Risk (Climate-VAR) and implied temperature rise (ITR). We have reviewed these metrics and believe they are only suitable for internal use at this stage, due to limitations in the data availability and the underlying assumptions in their methodologies.\n\nWe have enhanced our internal reporting by incorporating ITR as an indicator of the temperature alignment of our investment portfolio, and Climate-VAR as an indicator of the portfolio's exposure to physical and transition climate change risks. We will continue to build our understanding of these metrics and consider their use for external disclosure once their limitations have been appropriately addressed or mitigated.\n\n## Monitoring and shaping industry developments\n\nWe continue to monitor developments related to the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and guidance from the regulatory authorities in markets where we operate and will continue to review the completeness and robustness of our sustainabilityrelated data and methodologies in general.\n\nWe have also reviewed the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as part of our ongoing evaluation of our climate targets. As part of this process, in 2023 we met with the SBTi specifically around the applicability of its methodology to emerging markets. The SBTi uses global decarbonisation targets and pathways for verification that do not differentiate between the requirements of emerging markets and developed markets. In line with our commitment to a just and inclusive net zero transition, we believe it is crucial to recognise the differing transition challenges faced by different countries and companies. This also aligns with the Paris Agreement, which includes the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Our responsible investment approach seeks to incorporate this principle. We will continue to engage with the SBTi and monitor its publications to understand whether its methodology can be applied appropriately in our markets.\n\nFor more information on our participation in regional and global advocacy, please refer to Harnessing thought leadership to shape the agenda section of the Sustainability Report.",

        "page_content": "## How we operate\n\n## Board, Director and Committee responsibilities\n\nLed by the Chair, the Board is responsible for the overall leadership of the Group, which includes:\n\n- - Delivering long-term sustainable success for shareholders and contributing to wider society;\n- - Approving the Group's long-term strategic objectives, business plan and budgets;\n- - Monitoring performance and implementation of strategy and strategic objectives, capital allocation, and business plans;\n- - Establishing the Group's purpose and values and ensuring that the values and culture are aligned with the Group's strategy;\n- - Fostering and overseeing the embedding of culture;\n- - Ensuring that an effective system of internal control and risk management is in place and approving the Group's overall risk appetite and tolerance;\n- - Approving Prudential's periodic financial reporting disclosures;\n- - Approving the appointment of Directors, including the Chief Executive Officer, and the appointment of the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, and ensuring an effective system of talent development and succession planning for senior leadership roles; and\n- - Ensuring effective engagement with stakeholders.\n\nTo help the Board carry out its functions, some of its responsibilities are delegated to the Board's principal Committees, which consist of Non-executive Directors only. The Board's principal Committees are the Audit Committee, the Nomination & Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Risk Committee. The Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG) assists the Board with the Group's Sustainability framework and is responsible for engagement with the workforce. In 2024, the Board plans to establish a Sustainability Committee to replace the RSWG.\n\nThe Board receives regular updates on the activities of its Committees and the RSWG.\n\nThe Board's responsibilities are outlined in the schedule of matters reserved to the Board, which is available on our website at www.prudentialplc.com/en/investors/governance-and-policies/boardand-committees-governance.\n\nThe Board's responsibilities are also subject to relevant laws and regulations, and to Prudential's Articles of Association, which can be found at www.prudentialplc.com/en/investors/governance-andpolicies/memorandum-and-articles-of-association.\n\nThe roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are separate, with a clear division of responsibilities between the Chair's leadership of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer's responsibilities for the day-today management of the Group. All other Board members are independent Non-executive Directors who offer strategic guidance and constructive challenge to management. At the date of this report, the Board consists of 10 Non-executive Directors and one Executive Director, who is the CEO. From 1 April 2024, the Board will consist of 11 Non-executive Directors and the CEO, following the appointment of Mark Saunders. David Law will not stand for re-election at the AGM in line with governance guidelines, given his nine-year tenure.\n\nThe Board's size allows for effective decision-making and reflects a broad range of views and perspectives. More information on the skills and experience of individual Directors can be found in their biographies on pages 155 to 160.  More information on their independence can be found on page 181.\n\nThe Chair, CEO and SID all have written terms of reference which are approved by the Board and kept under regular review.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nThe Board is typically scheduled to meet at least six times a year and at the end of each of those meetings the Non-executive Directors meet without the Executive Director present. In 2023, the Board held seven scheduled meetings and an additional four ad-hoc meetings. In addition, the Board held a full-day strategy workshop in April and went on a site visit to the Hong Kong business.\n\nAll scheduled meetings typically take place at our Head Office in Hong Kong or at one of our businesses, providing opportunities for Board members to engage directly with management and the wider workforce. Additional meetings are scheduled as required and are often held virtually, particularly if called at short notice.\n\nBoard and Committee papers are typically provided one week ahead of a meeting and where a Director is unable to attend a meeting, their views are canvassed in advance by the Chair if possible.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, and the Company Secretary have a standing invitation to all Board meetings (except for private meetings of the Non-executive Directors).",

        "page_content": "## Standing Committee\n\nIn addition to the principal Committees and the RSWG, the Board operates a Standing Committee that meets to discuss any ad-hoc urgent issues which cannot be delayed until the next scheduled Board meeting. All Directors are members of the Standing Committee and can attend meetings and receive all related documents. Before making decisions, the Standing Committee must agree that the topics for discussion do not require consideration by the whole Board. The Standing Committee allows for agile decision-making when needed, while ensuring that the Board receives all feedback and that all Directors can contribute. In 2023, the Standing Committee met three times.\n\n## Delegation to management\n\nWhile responsibility for the day-to-day management of the business and implementation of strategy has been delegated to the CEO, the CEO delegates certain responsibilities to senior executives through management reporting lines (principally to other members of the GEC).\n\nThe members of the GEC, and short biographies of each individual, can be found on pages 161 to 162.\n\nThe CFO and CRCO are part of the GEC, with the Board approving their appointment and removal. Their performance reviews include feedback from the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees respectively, and their remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe GEC meets every week and supports the CEO in the day-to-day management of the business and the implementation of strategy.\n\nStrategic Business Groups bring together our mature and growth businesses within different markets to drive performance, operational excellence and the sharing of best practice. The Managing Directors of these groups are responsible for the operational results of the businesses within their group and for the Group-wide delivery of enabling functions. The Eastspring CEO is responsible for the growth of Eastspring's business and the delivery of its investment performance.\n\nBusiness review meetings take place every quarter to review business performance over the previous quarter and discuss the outlook and plans for the upcoming quarter, led by the CEO. Each quarterly meeting has different focus areas, for example results preparation in the first quarter and the business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. Participants include members of local executive committees, members of the GEC and other key members from head office and the Strategic Business Groups.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nPrudential is committed to high standards of governance across the whole Group. The Group Governance Manual (GGM) outlines the Group-wide approach to governance, risk management and internal control, and helps embed it into the day-to-day operations of the business. The principles that guide our business activities are set out in the Group Code of Conduct (Code), which sits at the heart of the GGM.\n\nThe Code is reviewed yearly by the RSWG and is approved by the Board. The 2023 review brought the Code in line with Prudential's refreshed values, making the standards of business and personal conduct more engaging and clearer for everyone. All employees confirm every year that they have adhered to these standards. The Code can be found on our website www.prudentialplc.com/investors/ governance-and-policies/code-of-business-conduct.\n\nThe GGM also outlines the Group's governance framework, Groupwide policies and standards, including the Group Risk Framework, delegated authorities and lines of responsibility, and is supported by a programme of regular training across the Group.\n\nThe Nomination & Governance Committee carries out regular reviews of the Group's governance framework, monitors significant governance policies, including those of the Group's Material Subsidiaries (as described below), and makes recommendations to the Board when needed. The Risk Committee approves the GGM's Group Risk Framework, an integral part of the GGM, while the Audit Committee monitors Groupwide compliance with the GGM throughout the year. Businesses manage and report compliance with the Group-wide mandatory requirements set out in the GGM through an ongoing GGM policy exemption and breach reporting process. This includes compliance with our risk management framework, which is summarised on pages 176 to 177 of this report.\n\nReflecting the developing nature of the Group and the markets we operate in, the GGM is reviewed regularly with any significant changes to key policies reported to the relevant Board Committee or the RSWG. The GGM helps the Board embed the Group's system of risk management and internal control into the day-to-day operations of the business.\n\n## Material subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's Material Subsidiaries are made up of our insurance subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore and the Eastspring holding company.\n\n| Subsidiary                                               | GEC member responsible                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prudential Hong  Kong Limited                            | Lilian Ng, Managing Director of the  Strategic Business Group including Hong  Kong                                                   |\n| PT Prudential Life  Assurance  (Indonesia)               | Solmaz Altin, Managing Director of the  Strategic Business Group including  Indonesia and Malaysia                                   |\n| Prudential  Assurance Malaysia  Berhad                   | Solmaz Altin, Managing Director of the  Strategic Business Group including  Indonesia and Malaysia                                   |\n| Prudential  Assurance  Company  Singapore (Pte)  Limited | Dennis Tan, Managing Director of the  Strategic Business Group including  Singapore and CEO, Prudential Assurance  Company Singapore |\n| Eastspring  Investments Group  Pte.

All audit and risk committees of the Material Subsidiaries, as well as a number of those of other subsidiaries, are chaired by an independent board member. To ensure consistent communications, the Chairs of the Group Audit and Risk Committees maintain regular dialogue with their counterparts in each of the Material Subsidiaries. Material Subsidiaries and other life insurance businesses that operate local audit and risk committees provide written updates to Group-level Committees and can refer issues to the Group Committee Chairs or management if needed.\n\nIn 2023, the Chairs of the Group Audit and Risk Committees hosted an online subsidiary governance forum, where they met with Nonexecutive Directors from each of the Material Subsidiaries to discuss areas of mutual importance, including the Group's strategy, performance, sustainability and key areas of focus in audit and risk.",

The GWS Framework includes requirements for Hong Kong insurance groups to have appropriate corporate governance arrangements in place, and to maintain appropriate internal controls for the oversight of their business.\n\nIndividual regulated entities within the Group are also subject to entitylevel regulations in the jurisdictions in which they carry out business.\n\nWe are committed to holding constructive discussions with regulators and our Chair, CEO and CRCO represent the Group in these interactions.\n\n## Directors' inductions, training and development\n\nThe induction programme for new Non-executive Directors covers a series of core topics, including an overview of the Group, its key businesses and the control environment, as well as content tailored to reflect the new Board member's role and any particular needs identified during the recruitment process. The induction includes written materials, presentations and meetings with the Chair, the CEO, the CFO, the CRCO and the Chairs of the Board's Committees and the RSWG (as appropriate). Additional meetings with members of senior management at Group and local level can also be held to develop the Director's knowledge of the business. Each new Board member is also assigned a longer-tenured Non-executive Director to support them in their new role and provide advice and feedback. New Directors usually join the Audit or Risk Committee to develop their knowledge of the business.\n\nIn addition to the induction of Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff in 2023 (see page 169), the CEO received an in-depth induction programme, led by the Company Secretary and overseen by the Chair, in relation to his role and duties as Chief Executive Officer and Director.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board and its Committees received regular business updates and participated in deep-dive sessions that helped to develop their knowledge of individual businesses, current and emerging issues relevant to the Group and particular products and business opportunities. This included in-depth sessions about the Group's operations in different markets. In 2023, these sessions were focused on deep dives to support the Board's consideration of the Group's refreshed strategy, including the drivers of value underpinning the Group's strategy, market analysis and trends, macroeconomic trends, and each of the key pillars and enablers of the strategy.\n\nThe Board also received updates on a number of topics, including macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, the continued transformation of the Group into an Asia- and Africa-focused business and the development of the Group's purpose and values. The Board and the Audit Committee received updates on the implementation of the new financial reporting standard, IFRS 17, which became effective from 1 January 2023, including the impact on the Group's financial reporting.\n\nAll Directors have the opportunity to discuss their individual development needs as part of their Director evaluations and are encouraged to ask for specific updates during the year. At the end of the year, suggested topics are shared with the Board for feedback. Directors are asked to provide information on any external training or development on a yearly basis. All Directors have the right to obtain professional advice at Prudential's expense.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nInformation on the Board's engagement with, and discussion of, stakeholder views as part of the Board decision-making process can be found on pages 88 to 96.\n\nDirectors' remuneration report\n\nFinancial statements\n\n## Employee voice\n\nPrudential's programme for workforce engagement is led by the RSWG and all Board members take part in engagement activities. An overview of the workforce engagement activities during 2023 can be found in the Section 172 statement on page 92.\n\n## Shareholder Communication Policy and engagement\n\nWe have dual primary listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, as well as a secondary listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange and a listing of American Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. These listings are each subject to rules that inform our Shareholder Communications Policy.\n\nThis policy provides that shareholders and the larger investment community are provided with timely access to balanced and understandable information about the Company, and its financial performance, strategic goals, plans and material developments. This helps all shareholders and prospective shareholders exercise their rights in an informed manner.\n\nInformation released by the Company to these stock exchanges is also posted on the Company's website (www.prudentialplc.com). Prudential's corporate communications are available in English and Chinese.\n\nTo better understand shareholder views, the Chair holds an annual engagement programme with major shareholders focusing on governance and strategy. The Remuneration Committee Chair also engages with major shareholders annually to hear their feedback on remuneration decisions and policy proposals. Other Non-executive Directors, in particular the SID and Committee Chairs, are available to meet with major shareholders on request. Shareholders can share their views on issues affecting the Company through various channels throughout the year, including investor events. Retail shareholders can access dedicated services through the Company's Registrars, EQ in the UK and Computershare in Hong Kong. More information can be found in the 'Shareholder information' section on page 401 and on the Company's website, including contact details for the Group's Secretariat.\n\nThe Board conducts an annual review of its Shareholder Communications Policy. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Board concluded that the Shareholder Communications Policy continues to be effective.\n\nDuring 2023, almost 600 meetings were held with over 480 institutional investors in Asia, the US, Europe and the UK. The CEO or another member of the GEC attended 192 of these meetings, which took place as one-to-one sessions, group meetings, panels or in some cases walking tours organised by brokers. You can find a summary of the Board's stakeholder engagement activities in the Section 172 statement on pages 88 to 96. These views and opinions are taken into account by the Board when making strategic decisions.\n\nThe Group provided a strategy update alongside its 2023 Half Year Report which was followed by an extensive programme of investor interactions. The Group continues to host presentations in Hong Kong, with open communications with shareholders and the research community supported by live and online material. The Managing Directors of the Group's Strategic Business Groups also provide regular updates. The Group remains focused on supporting an increase in share trading liquidity on the Hong Kong line and has maintained an enhanced programme of related marketing in the Asia region, particularly on the Chinese Mainland and in Hong Kong, targeting both retail and institutional investors.\n\nThe Group's AGM in 2023 was a hybrid meeting with shareholders attending in-person and online. The Group plans to continue to offer both in-person and online communications to investors in the year ahead.",

        "page_content": "## Induction of Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff\n\nIn January 2023, Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff joined the Board as an Independent Non-executive Director and member of the Risk Committee and the RSWG.\n\nAs part of her induction, Claudia visited the head offices in London and Hong Kong, where she met with members of the Board and Group Executive Committee as well as functional leads. Additionally, Claudia visited the Singapore and Indonesia businesses for meetings with local management teams, receiving detailed briefings on each business and experiencing directly how businesses support their customers and distributors. Given her background in healthcare, she met with the chief health officers in these markets to better understand their health businesses.\n\nThrough her induction, Claudia gained insight into the Group's business, strategy, operations, risk profile and culture. She also received briefings on her duties as a Director under relevant UK and Hong Kong corporate governance frameworks and the Group's regulatory environment. In addition, she participated in Board deepdive sessions and one-to-one meetings with senior management which helped her gain an understanding of the various Strategic Business Groups and the Eastspring asset management business.\n\nSpecifically for her role, Claudia met with the Chairs of the Risk Committee and RSWG. As a member of the Risk Committee, Claudia met with the CRCO who provided an overview of the Group's risk profile, risk framework and key risks, and had more detailed sessions with senior members of the Risk team covering areas such as risk appetite limits and triggers, capital regimes, conduct, and financial crime. She also met with the Chief of Internal Audit who provided an overview of Group-wide Internal Audit and its recent activities, with the external auditor who shared their views on Prudential's financial reporting, and with the Chief of Financial & Capital Reporting who provided a briefing on the Group's key performance indicators and balance sheet and also provided training on IFRS 17.\n\nTo learn more about the RSWG and its activities, Claudia met with the Director of ESG and received a briefing on the Group's ESG strategic framework. The Group HR Director briefed Claudia on the Group's culture framework and workforce strategies and initiatives, including D&I and employee wellbeing priorities.\n\nThese meetings were tailored to Claudia's role at Prudential and provided her with a detailed view of current issues and emerging themes, as well as an understanding of the interests of the Group's key stakeholders.\n\nJeremy Anderson was chosen as the long-standing Nonexecutive Director to support Claudia during her first year on the Board. Following the conclusion of her formal induction programme, Claudia provided the Company Secretary with feedback on the programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMy induction gave me an excellent introduction to the business, my role and our key stakeholder groups. It was particularly valuable to meet with many of our teams and hear first hand from local teams what their significant issues and areas of focus are. This has given me a thorough understanding of our Strategic Business Groups and helped me contribute effectively to Board and Committee discussions immediately.",

The external nature of the review met the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, which provides that external evaluations should happen at least every three years.\n\nThe Nomination & Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the process by which the Board, its Committees and individual Directors' effectiveness is assessed. The Committee decided to appoint IBE, who had undertaken the last externallyfacilitated review in late 2020. The 2020 review had focussed on forward-looking observations to support the Chair as she took over the role in January 2021. The Committee considered IBE to be best placed to reflect on the progress made by the Board since that time, understanding the nature of the transformation that the Group and the Board had been through since then.\n\nIBE does not have any other connections with the Company or any of the Directors and there were no concerns about their ability to exercise independent and objective judgement.\n\nThe evaluation included seeking feedback, via face to face interviews, from each Director, the Company Secretary, senior management and other non-Board contributors. Ffion Hague attended and observed meetings of the Board, its Committees and the RSWG. The Company Secretary was responsible for providing IBE with access to relevant meeting materials and any other support requested. The Senior Independent Director was identified as the escalation point for the review, if needed.\n\nAll Board members were interviewed according to a set agenda, tailored for the Board, which covered all main functions of the Board and aspects of its effectiveness including Board performance and focus, Board composition, Board culture, the Board's relationship with management, succession planning, induction and training, and the support provided to Board members.\n\n## Theme\n\n## Summary of actions\n\nDraft conclusions were discussed with the Chair and the Chairs of the Committees and RSWG before being presented to the Board in early March 2024. The Board discussed the review's observations and recommendations and exchanged thoughts on actions to respond to them.\n\nIBE's report highlighted the positive and collaborative atmosphere around the Board table, the open culture of transparency between the Board and the management team, the Board's strong relationship with the Chief Executive Officer and senior management team, the strength of its risk oversight and that there was a diverse and relevant mix of skills around the table. The Report noted the relative newness of many Board members and the management team, which meant that the Board was still in its forming stage. Whilst the early signs were very positive, the Report made a number of suggestions to help the Board accelerate the learning curve in order to get it operating at its full potential as soon as possible.\n\n- - Induction and education - effective induction programmes for new Directors and increased travel by the Board/Committees in order to spend more time getting to know the business and each other, and setting expectations for the amount of time needed to do this.\n- - Relationship with senior management - structured approaches to increasing informal interaction between Non-executive Directors and senior management, and for formalising employee engagement activity.\n- - Defining the model: both in terms of Board/Committee responsibilities and central/local functions, to help new Board members and to create more space at Board meetings for more strategic thinking.\n\nThrough the evaluation and subsequent discussion, the Board identified areas of particular focus and related actions:\n\n| Induction and education             | - Enhance Non-executive Director induction processes - Board scheduling to maximise opportunities for Board travel to markets together post Covid                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Relationship with senior management | - Develop a more structured approach to the development of relationships between the Board  and the GEC talent pipeline                                                                                |\n| Operation of the Board              | -  Continue focus on streamlining Board papers and honing key messages                                                                                                                                 |\n| Group governance                    | -  Review articulation of Group model and interaction between Group and subsidiary boards  and committees -  Formalise the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group as a Sustainability Committee |",

The framework is underpinned by the Group Code of Conduct, which sets out the ethical standards of the Board, employees, agents, suppliers and others working on behalf of the Group. It is supported by a set of Group-wide principles and values that outline the way the Group expects business to be carried out while striving to achieve its strategic objectives. This framework is designed to monitor and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of not meeting these objectives, while taking into account the interests of our different stakeholders.\n\nAs a provider of financial services, the Group recognises the interests of a broad spectrum of stakeholders and that managed acceptance of risk lies at the heart of the business. As a result, effective risk management represents a key source of competitive advantage for the Group. Through selective exposure to risk, we seek to generate customer and shareholder value, where these are an outcome of chosen business activities and strategy. These risks will be reduced when it is cost-effective to do so. The Group's systems, procedures and controls are designed to manage risk appropriately, and our resilience and recovery plans aim to maintain our ability and flexibility to respond in times of stress. There are some financial and nonfinancial risks for which the Group has no tolerance, and these are actively avoided.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Group Governance Manual (GGM) sets out the general principles by which we conduct our business and defines our Group-wide approach to governance, risk management and internal control. More information on the GGM can be found on page 167.\n\nGroup-wide policies, internal controls and processes, based on the GGM, are in place across the Group and include controls around the preparation of financial reporting. The operation of these controls and processes supports the preparation of reliable financial reporting and of local and consolidated financial statements that adhere to applicable accounting standards, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These controls include certifications by the CEO and CFO of each business on the accuracy of information provided for use in the Group's consolidated financial reporting, and the assurance work carried out as required by US reporting requirements.\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee to review the framework and effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. The Audit Committee is supported by the assurance work carried out by Group-wide Internal Audit (GwIA) and the Group's Material Subsidiary audit committees, which oversee the effectiveness of controls in each respective business. Details of how the Audit Committee oversees the framework of controls and their effectiveness on an ongoing basis can be found on pages 183 to 189.\n\n## Risk management\n\nA key part of the GGM is the Group Risk Framework, which requires all businesses to have established processes for i) identifying; ii) measuring and assessing; iii) managing and controlling; and iv) monitoring and reporting the risks facing the business.\n\nThe Board determines the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives while taking into account the interests of our stakeholders. The Board has delegated authority to the Risk Committee to assist it in providing leadership, direction and oversight of the Group's overall risk appetite, risk tolerance and strategy. The Risk Committee also oversees and advises on the current and potential future risk exposures of the Group; reviews and approves the Group's risk management framework, including changes to risk limits within the Board-approved risk appetite; and monitors the effectiveness of the framework and adherence to the various risk policies. Its regular activities can be found on pages 190 to 194.\n\nThe Group's risk governance arrangements, which support the Board, the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, are based on the principles of the 'three lines model': risk-taking and management, risk control and oversight, and independent assurance.\n\n## Formal review of controls\n\nA formal evaluation of the risk management and internal control system is carried out at least once a year. Before the Board reaches a conclusion on the effectiveness of the system in place, the report is considered by the Disclosure Committee and the Audit Committee, with risk-specific disclosures in the report also reviewed by the Risk Committee. This evaluation takes place before the publication of the Annual Report.\n\nAs part of the assessment, businesses carrying out the annual risk and control evaluation must produce a business controls report that includes the outcome of their risk and control assessment, including any relevant issues identified and reported by other Group oversight functions, findings from reviews undertaken by GwIA, which carries out risk-based audits across the Group, and any material issues arising from any external regulatory engagements. Any breaches or exemptions raised under Group policies and their implications for the functioning of internal controls are also considered. The Group Governance function, under the direction of the CRCO, supports the carrying out of this evaluation process.\n\nThe Group's effectiveness assessment follows the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting. In line with this guidance, the evaluation does not apply to material joint ventures and associates where the Group does not exercise full management control. In these cases, the Group ensures that suitable governance and risk management arrangements are in place to protect the Group's interests. Moreover, the relevant Group company which is part of the joint venture or associate must also comply with the requirements of the Group's internal governance framework.",

This review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, risk management systems, budgets and the adequacy of the resources, qualifications, experience of staff of the Group's Accounting, Internal Audit, Financial Reporting and Sustainability functions. The review identified areas for improvement, particularly in respect of the general IT control environment, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken. The audit committees at Group and Material Subsidiary levels collectively monitor outstanding actions regularly and make sure enough resources and focus are in place to resolve them within a reasonable time frame.\n\nThe Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, measuring and assessing, managing and controlling, and monitoring and reporting the significant risks faced by the Group and confirms that the system remains effective.",

It also supports and advises the Board on governance arrangements.\n\nMore information on the role and responsibilities of the Nomination & Governance Committee can be found in its Terms of Reference, which are available at https:// www.prudentialplc.com/investors/governance-and-policies/ board-and-committees-governance\n\n## Membership and 2023 meeting attendance\n\n| Committee members   | Member since                          | 2023 meetings 1   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Shriti Vadera       | May 2020  (Chair since January  2021) | 4/4               |\n| Jeremy Anderson     | November 2022                         | 4/4               |\n| Chua Sock Koong     | May 2022                              | 4/4               |\n| Ming Lu 2           | May 2021                              | 3/4               |\n| Philip Remnant 3    | January 2013                          | 1/2               |\n| George Sartorel     | May 2022                              | 4/4               |\n\n## Regular attendees\n\n- - CEO\n- - CHRO\n- - Company Secretary\n- (1) The Committee held one scheduled joint meeting with the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group.\n- (2) Ming Lu was unable to attend one scheduled meeting which was rescheduled at relatively short notice.\n- (3) Philip Remnant retired from the Board on 25 May 2023.\n\n## Nomination & Governance Committee report\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nFollowing the intense activity in 2022, with the process that led to the appointment of Anil as our new CEO, the Committee's key areas of focus in 2023 were succession planning for the Audit Committee and overseeing the development of updated succession plans for senior leadership roles.\n\nAs I set out in my Chair's statement, we put in place a succession plan for David Law's upcoming retirement from the Board. Jeanette Wong, a well-established member of the Audit Committee, will transition to chair it and we recruited Mark Saunders to reinforce our insurancespecific financial assurance skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee remains focused on ensuring the Board has the right skills and experience to oversee the Group and provide support and challenge to management as they execute the refreshed strategy.\n\nThe Committee remains focused on ensuring the Board has the right skills  and  experience  to  oversee  the  Group  and  provide  support  and challenge to management as they execute the refreshed strategy. To do so, we continue to prioritise candidates with deep Asian operating experience  and  strong  digital  understanding,  alongside  ensuring  a balance of specific market and sectoral experience.",

        "page_content": "## Committee highlights 2023\n\n- - Ensuring that the Board and its committees continue to have the right skills and experience, particularly in light of the impending retirement of the Chair of the Audit Committee, David Law;\n- - Overseeing succession planning for GEC roles and, with the RSWG, overseeing the Group's methodology for succession planning below GEC level and talent development to support operationalisation of the Board's strategy; and\n- - Reviewing and confirming the appropriateness of Material Subsidiary and other subsidiary governance arrangements.\n\nThe Committee recognises that with David's departure after the AGM, the average Director tenure will be lower than for most boards. There are two main reasons for this.  Firstly, the Group has undergone significant transformation over the last four years with two demergers. During this time the Board did not significantly change, and now the Board and Committee can look for individuals who have relevant operating experience in our key markets. Secondly, we had a high number of Directors whose tenure expired over a short period between the 2020 and 2022 AGMs.\n\nThis also puts an onus on effective induction for new Board members, which the Committee oversees. Most recently, the Committee oversaw Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff's induction in 2023 (further detail is provided on page 169) and it will oversee Mark Saunders' induction this year.\n\nThe changes to the Group Executive Committee (GEC) over the last two years, and the additional leadership capabilities needed to execute our strategy make effective succession planning for leadership roles  vital. The Committee held a joint meeting with the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group to discuss the development of our refreshed framework for talent development and succession planning. We were pleased to see the progress made by the CEO and CHRO in developing a more systematic, Group-wide approach for all our markets. Given the importance of the topic, we discussed succession plans for the CEO and GEC members with the whole Board, and we have scheduled further discussions in 2024 as the new framework embeds.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee also reviewed the governance arrangements for the Group's Material Subsidiaries.\n\nThe external Board effectiveness evaluation gave us a valuable opportunity to reflect upon the changes the Board has been through since I took over as Chair in 2021, and how the Board is working, together, and how it is working with the management team.  I was delighted to get Ffion Hague's positive feedback on this and the validation of our efforts to date.  I welcome the constructive recommendations on how we can be even more effective in the future.\n\nThis report sets out in detail our activities in 2023.  I would like to thank the Committee members for their diligence and contribution throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shriti Vadera\n\nChair of the Nomination & Governance Committee",

Board succession plans are supported and informed by the results of the annual Board evaluation, individual Director evaluations and any skills gaps identified. Ongoing succession planning helps the Board maintain a balance in the mix of skills and experiences of its members.\n\nThe Committee reviews the size, structure and composition of the Board, its principal Committees and the RSWG.  As part of the review process, the Committee looks at the balance of Non-executive to Executive Directors on the Board, the overall number of Directors and their respective skills and experience. The Chair also considers the needs of the Board and its Committees as part of the annual Board evaluation and the Committee continuously discusses desired skills as part of succession planning.\n\nTo support its assessment of skills and succession planning, the Committee maintains a skills matrix for Non-executive Directors which helps map the Board's existing skills and identify any shortages.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\nNon-executive Directors bring a range of industry experience, sector expertise and personal strengths to the Board. In 2022, the Committee identified the need for a Board member with insurancespecific financial assurance expertise in anticipation of David Law reaching the end of his tenure in 2024, after nine years on the Board. The recruitment process led to the appointment of Mark Saunders, who brings extensive knowledge of the insurance industry and Asia markets having been employed in the industry for 35 years. For the last 30 of those years, he was based in Hong Kong. A qualified actuary, most recently he served on the executive committee of AIA Group Limited as Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Prior to that, he spent over 16 years at Tillinghast (now Willis Towers Watson) where he led many actuarial appraisal value assessments of insurers across 20 markets in Asia Pacific, ultimately becoming leader of the Hong Kong business and transforming the Asia Pacific insurance consulting practice.  Since retiring from AIA in March 2022, Mark has remained active in several advisory roles in the insurance industry. Mark will join both the Audit and Risk Committees.\n\n## Committee membership and financial skills\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee also reviewed the membership of the Board's principal Committees and the RSWG. In anticipation of David Law's retirement at this year's AGM, the Committee identified Jeanette Wong as a natural successor to the role of Audit Committee Chair. During her extensive executive career in financial services, Jeanette was Chief Financial Officer at DBS Group for five years.  As a Non-executive Director, she has been a member of the Audit Committee at UBS Group since 2019 and has performed strongly as a Prudential Audit Committee member since joining the Board in 2021.\n\nFrom 20 March 2024, Jeanette will succeed David as Audit Committee Chair. David Law remains the financial expert as defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until his retirement at the conclusion of the AGM on 23 May 2024, when Jeanette will become the designated financial expert.\n\nFor the purposes of the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes, each member of the Audit Committee has recent and relevant financial experience. Detailed information on the experience, qualifications and skill sets of all Committee members can be found on pages 155 to 160.\n\nThe Committee also considered the membership of the Remuneration Committee. Following the retirement of Philip Remnant and Tom Watjen in May 2023, and in anticipation of the retirement of David Law in May 2024, the Committee recommended the appointment of George Sartorel, who was appointed from 25 May 2023, and Shriti Vadera, who will join the Committee on 23 May 2024, from the conclusion of the 2024 AGM.\n\nWhen making recommendations, the Committee takes account of the current composition of each of the principal Committees and the RSWG, the skills and experience of the members and the strategic objectives of the Group.\n\nThese appointments are part of an ongoing process to refresh the Board to ensure it has the right skills and experience to support the Group's strategic objectives in Asia and Africa, both now and in the future. Whilst the Committee does not consider there to be any immediate skills gaps on the Board to address, in future searches it intends to prioritise further digital/technology expertise and individuals with deep working knowledge of Greater China.\n\nThe regular and ongoing review of candidates by the Committee allows for a controlled approach to the onboarding of new Nonexecutive Directors, and for a transition period in respect of Directors reaching the end of their tenure.\n\n## Executive roles\n\nGiven the importance of executive succession planning to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy, the Board discussed succession planning for the CEO and the other GEC roles. CEO and GEC succession planning had been identified as an area of focus in the 2022 Board evaluation following senior leadership changes that year and the Board was pleased to see the refreshed approach developed by the new CEO and CHRO.\n\nTo help with succession planning, the Committee oversees a diverse pipeline of leadership talent below the level of the GEC. The RSWG also shares some responsibilities when it comes to succession planning and talent development across the Group, including diversity, inclusion and employee wellbeing. The Committee and RSWG hold joint meetings where appropriate. In 2023, a joint meeting took place in October which looked in closer detail at the development of a more systematic approach to talent development and succession planning for senior leadership roles.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee worked with talent agencies Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds, both of which support the searches for Non-executive Directors. Both firms are also engaged by the Group for senior management recruitment. There are no other connections to Prudential or to any of the Directors.\n\n## Process for appointing new Directors\n\nThe Committee helps the Board put in place a formal, rigorous and transparent approach to the appointment of new Directors, and is involved from the beginning when a vacancy or a gap in the Board's skills is identified. A role description which reflects the desired skills, experience and Committee feedback, as well as the Board's diversity objectives, is prepared, after which specialist talent agencies are briefed. A short-list is drafted from the long-list provided by agencies, with Committee members and selected Board members interviewing the chosen candidates. The SID leads the Committee in the process of appointing a new Chair and the Chair leads the process for the appointment of a new CEO, involving all Non-executive Directors in the process.\n\nDue diligence checks run alongside, and Prudential liaises with the relevant regulatory authorities. The Committee is kept up to date as",

        "page_content": "needed. Following appointment, the Committee then oversees the induction of the new Non-executive Directors.\n\n## Director induction\n\nThe Committee helps the Chair to provide a tailored induction programme for each new non-executive appointee. During 2023, the Committee oversaw the induction for Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff and more information on this can be found on page 169.\n\n## Board, Committee and Director evaluation\n\nThe Committee oversees the performance review of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors and approved the appointment of Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation to conduct the 2023 external review. No material issues were identified in respect of the operation of the Committees, which were included in the Board evaluation. The findings were presented to the Board in March 2024 and are described on pages 173 to 175.\n\nFollowing evaluation, the Committee decided that each of the Directors continued to perform effectively and was able to devote appropriate time to their responsibilities, and that the Board and its Committees had an appropriate combination of skills, experience and knowledge.\n\nIn support of this decision, the Committee found that the Nonexecutive Directors continued to demonstrate the desired attributes and contribute effectively to decision-making, and that they exercised sound judgement in holding management to account. As a result, the Committee recommended these Directors for election (or re-election) at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nTo help bring a range of skills and expertise to the Board, the Committee seeks candidates with backgrounds, experience and skills that boost the Board's capabilities, especially in the markets where we operate. When searching for new candidates, the Committee briefs talent search agencies on the Board's requirements with candidates selected against a range of criteria and considerations that include sector-specific knowledge, operational experience and commercial acumen, insights into the markets in which the Group operates, and diversity (including thought and perspective, gender, ethnicity, age, nationality and geographical provenance), and social, educational and professional backgrounds.\n\nThe UK Listing Rules require boards to meet and report on diversity and gender targets. The Board's target for female representation on the Board is 40 per cent by the end of 2025. As of 31 December 2023, the role of Chair was held by a woman and the overall representation of women on our Board was 45 per cent. On 1 April 2024 female representation will decrease to 41 per cent.  As previously announced, David Law will not stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.\n\nThe Parker Review recommends that we appoint at least one Director from what is regarded in the UK as an ethnic minority background. We do not consider this to be the most pertinent measure for an Asiabased group and we have comfortably exceeded this recommendation, with 7 of our 11 Directors meeting the criteria as at 31 December 2023 (63 per cent). We are one of only six FTSE 100 companies with a non-white Chair.\n\nThe Group's Diversity and Inclusion Policy applies at all levels of the business and the Committee is responsible for overseeing a diverse pipeline of talent for the Board and other senior executive roles, driving a Group-wide culture where our people feel valued, are treated fairly and are respected.\n\nThe Committee considers that the pipeline for diverse talent to serve on the GEC is reasonable, but with continued effort needed. We met our target of employing 35 per cent women in senior management by the end of 2023. The RSWG has overseen the development of a people dashboard, which includes measures for tracking local representation, gender, age, tenure and experience. Inclusive leadership practices apply to the Board, the Committees and the wider organisation. A full description of the Group's activities on D&I throughout the workforce, including at senior management level, can be found in the Sustainability section on pages 114 to 116.\n\n## Terms of appointment\n\nNon-executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years and, subject to review by the Committee and re-election by shareholders, it is expected that Non-executive Directors serve a second term of three years. After six years, Non-executive Directors may be appointed for a further year, up to a maximum of three additional years, or more in certain limited circumstances. Reappointment is subject to rigorous review as well as re-election by shareholders.\n\nIn line with the UK Code, the notice of the AGM includes details on the skills and experience of each Director seeking re-election and specific reasons why their contribution is, and continues to be, important to the Company's long-term sustainable success.\n\nThe Directors' remuneration report sets out the terms of Nonexecutive Directors' letters of appointment and the terms applicable to the Executive Director's contract.\n\n## Independence\n\nAll Directors have a statutory duty to exercise independent judgement. For Non-executive Directors, the application of independent judgement is critical to their role in providing constructive challenge and holding management to account, while providing strategic guidance and offering specialist advice. The independence of Non-executive Directors is assessed as part of the appointment process and is reviewed yearly. To support the assessment, each Non-executive Director (except the Chair) provides an annual independence confirmation. Members of the Audit Committee are also assessed against the independence criteria outlined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nFollowing review by the Committee, all Non-executive Directors were considered to be independent. The Chair, who was independent on appointment, is no longer assessed as independent in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nWhen considering the independence of the Non-executive Directors, the Committee and the Board took into account that both Jeremy Anderson and Jeanette Wong serve as non-executive directors of UBS Group AG and that Chua Sock Koong and Jeanette Wong serve as members of the Singapore Securities Industry Council.  The Committee and the Board have determined that these relationships do not affect the independence of those Non-executive Directors. Based on their contributions to Board discussions to date, the Board is confident that they can be expected to continue to demonstrate objectivity and independence of judgement.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to devote sufficient time as is needed to carry out their duties. The expected time commitment for Non-executive Directors is agreed and set out in writing in their Letter of Appointment. The appointment process also evaluates the individual's external time commitments and their impact on the person's suitability for the role. The assessment takes into account the time required to prepare for and attend Board and Committee",

Any other external appointments which could impact a Director's ability to meet their expected time commitments must first be discussed with the Chair, or, in the case of the Chair, with the SID.  In some cases, external appointments must also be approved by the Committee or the Board.\n\nShould the Executive Director wish to take on any external appointments, this would also be subject to Board consent. In line with UK Code recommendations, the Executive Director is not permitted to hold more than one non-executive directorship with a FTSE 100 company or other significant appointment.\n\nThe time commitment required of the Non-executive Directors was last considered in detail by the Committee in 2022 and has been kept under review, but no changes were considered necessary in 2023.\n\nThe Committee considered Directors' attendance during the year.\n\nThe Committee noted that attendance at scheduled meetings had been very good overall. Several additional, ad-hoc meetings had been held at short notice during the year and attendance had been more difficult, with some Directors unable to attend all of the additional meetings. In particular, whilst Ming Lu attended all scheduled Board meetings, he was unable to attend one scheduled Remuneration Committee, one scheduled Nomination & Governance Committee, and a number of short, ad-hoc Board and Remuneration Committee meetings that had been scheduled at short notice, due to clashes with his external executive responsibilities and travel commitments. Whilst his attendance at scheduled Board meetings was 100 per cent, his overall attendance record at Board and Committee meetings over the year was marginally below 75 per cent.\n\nThe Committee noted that Ming had devoted additional time during the year outside meetings, including to interview prospective Nonexecutive Directors and to meet with management to contribute to the development of the Group's strategy refresh. It also noted that his attendance record at meetings in previous years had been good, at over 90 per cent.\n\nThe Committee recognised that because of his executive commitments and travel requirements, Ming may not be able to attend all meetings, particularly when arranged at short notice, but it was not expected that his attendance in future years would be lower than 75 per cent.\n\nTaking these factors into consideration, the Committee was satisfied that Ming devoted sufficient time to perform his duties. Moreover, the Committee noted the value of having a serving executive on the Board and the insight that he brings in respect of Greater China and the ASEAN markets.\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that all Non-executive Directors had committed sufficient time to meet their responsibilities and contribute effectively. The Committee was supported in its conclusion by the feedback from the external Board evaluator, Independent Board Evaluation, who also reviewed individual Director performance in 2023.\n\nThe current time expectations for Board and Committee members are given below. The time expectations of Directors performing Chair roles are considerably more.\n\n## Number of regular scheduled meetings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board                                         |                                               | Approximate time  commitment   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 6 meetings                                    |                                               | 33 days                        |\n| Audit Committee                               |                                               | 15 days                        |\n| 5 meetings                                    |                                               |                                |\n| Risk Committee                                |                                               |                                |\n| 5 meetings                                    |                                               | 8.5 days                       |\n| Remuneration Committee                        |                                               |                                |\n| 4 meetings                                    | 6 days                                        |                                |\n| Nomination & Governance Committee             | Nomination & Governance Committee             |                                |\n| 3 meetings                                    | 5 days                                        |                                |\n| Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group | Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group |                                |\n| 4 meetings 5.5 days                           | 4 meetings 5.5 days                           |                                |\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDirectors have a statutory duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and Prudential also has procedures in place to identify and mitigate potential conflicts of interest. These processes help to ensure decisions are made in the best interests of the Company. The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to identify and authorise any actual or potential conflicts of interest, referring any specially material conflicts to the Board.\n\nWhen recommending a candidate for appointment or re-election, the Committee considers the external appointments of the individual and, where appropriate, recommends authorisation of any conflicts to the Board, attaching conditions to the authorisation where necessary. Should a Director wish to take on a new external position during the year, the Chair (or the SID in the case of the Chair) will evaluate the proposed appointment and will refer it to the Committee (or the Board) for authorisation if a conflict or potential conflict is identified.\n\nThe Board considers that the procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest operate effectively.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Committee reviews the Group's governance framework regularly, monitors the Group's significant governance policies (including governance arrangements of the Group's Material Subsidiaries) and, where appropriate, recommends changes to the Board. In 2023, a review was carried out to make sure the governance framework supports the Group's strategic objectives, with particular attention given to Material Subsidiaries. The review considered the skills and composition of the boards and committees, in particular the audit and risk committees, of the Material Subsidiaries - with no significant changes recommended following the review.",

It has been my privilege and pleasure to serve on this Board and in particular to have led the Audit Committee since May 2017. We have covered a lot of ground over the past nine years. I am pleased to be passing the chair to Jeanette Wong, who has been a member of the Committee since May 2021, and I am confident that the Committee will benefit from her skill, experience and knowledge.\n\nEarly in the year, the Committee agreed that its areas of focus for 2023 should include:\n\n- 1. Oversight and understanding of IFRS 17;\n- 2. Continuing to increase understanding of key assumptions and challenges at the Group's Material Subsidiaries;\n- 3. Facilitating the embedding of EY as the Group's auditor; and\n- 4. Monitoring financial reporting controls (with the Risk Committee), particularly in relation to IFRS 17, and other transformation activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has spent significant time in developing its understanding of the new IFRS17 accounting standard, overseeing its implementation, and discussed key accounting issues and judgments.\n\nThe  IFRS 17 standard came into effect on 1 January 2023, alongside the adoption of IFRS 9. The requirements of IFRS 17 are complex and although they do not alter the economics of the business, they require a fundamental change to the accounting presentation and disclosures of insurance contracts. The Group published its first set of interim results under the new standard in August, having held a briefing for investors in July to highlight the expected impact on the presentation of results. The Committee has spent significant time in developing its understanding of the new standard, has overseen its implementation and discussed key accounting issues and judgements.",

The Committee received regular updates on progress and held joint meetings with the Risk Committee in May and October to discuss delivery risks and to satisfy itself that the assurance and controls around the production of results were robust. This has been a multi-year project, involving considerable resource and effort, and I would like to thank the teams involved across the business for their hard work and diligence.\n\nIn order to have oversight of the important issues considered by subsidiaries, the Committee continued to receive written updates on the activities of the local audit committees. I also met regularly with the chairs of our Material Subsidiary audit committees and relayed those discussions to the Committee at its regular meetings. Over the year finance teams from the Material Subsidiaries and other local business units were invited to present to the Committee, the last such presentation was from Vietnam in March 2024. In October, in order to foster a close working relationship and deepen our understanding of audit and risk-related topics across the Group, Jeremy Anderson and I chaired a virtual conference attended by the Non-executive Directors of the Group's Material Subsidiaries.\n\nWe have paid close attention to our whistleblowing procedures. We received regular updates on cases and their resolution alongside indicators of issues. The matters are also discussed in private with me, the Board, the Committee or the relevant local audit committee as necessary.\n\nThe Committee held joint meetings with the Risk Committee to discuss the Group's approach to technology, data governance and AI.\n\nThe Group announced in May 2023 the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer, James Turner, following an investigation into a Code of Conduct issue relating to a recruitment situation. This led to the appointment of a new CFO, Ben Bulmer, and the Committee has worked closely with him as he transitioned into his new role. During the year the Committee also received a presentation on the planned work to modernise the Group's finance function, which Ben will lead.\n\n## External auditor\n\nAn important part of the Committee's work consists of overseeing the relationship with the Group's external auditor, including safeguarding independence and approving non-audit fees.\n\nIn accordance with mandatory rules governing external auditor rotation, KPMG LLP resigned as the Group's auditor at the Company's AGM in May 2023 and Ernst & Young LLP (EY) were appointed. The original tender process was completed in 2020 and the Committee has monitored the transition throughout the year and in the period leading up to it. The long run in has been helpful with our IFRS17 conversion and I am very grateful to both firms for the professional manner in which they have handled the change.\n\nThe Committee and I received regular updates from EY during the year and have met with the audit partners privately.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Committee received regular updates from the Chief Internal Auditor and key members of his team to discuss their work and matters arising. We also followed up specific points to ensure appropriate action was taken. During the year, we appointed an external third-party to provide the quality assurance of work performed by the internal audit team and we received positive feedback from them. As highlighted in the Risk management and controls section of this report, IT access controls have been one area of particular attention. Having a strong internal audit function with the appropriate resource focused on our key risks remains a priority for the Committee.\n\n## Committee operation, governance and compliance with regulatory requirements\n\nIn addition to Jeanette succeeding me as Chair of the Committee from 20 March 2024, I am pleased that Mark Saunders will be appointed as a Non-executive Director of the Company and will join the Audit Committee from 1 April 2024. Mark has extensive actuarial experience and knowledge of the insurance industry, as well as markets across the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe operation of the Committee was reviewed as part of the annual Board evaluation. No material issues were identified. Jeanette will rightly bring a fresh approach to the role the Committee plays going forward in helping the Company deliver its new strategic direction.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank management colleagues and fellow Committee members for their hard work, support and commitment, not just in 2023 but over the course of my time at Prudential. They have been and continue to be a great group of dedicated people and I wish them all the best for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDavid Law\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

        "page_content": "## Principal activities and significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during 2023\n\nAccounting judgements and estimates supporting the Group's results\n\nOne of the Committee's key responsibilities is to monitor the integrity of financial statements and any other periodic financial reports. This includes the half year financial statements, the Annual Report (including compliance with the GWS public reporting requirements), associated results announcements and Form 20-F disclosures, as well as the annual update of the Group's published Tax Strategy. The Committee also reviewed the quarterly business performance updates provided for the first and third quarter of 2023 and these will be issued on a regular basis going forward.\n\nIn reviewing these and other items, the Committee received reports from management and, as appropriate, reports from internal and external assurance providers.\n\nWhen considering financial reporting matters, the Committee assesses compliance with relevant accounting standards, regulations and governance codes focusing on key areas of judgement and complexity. A significant part of the Committee's activity in 2023 was to review the Group's implementation of IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'  which resulted in a substantial change to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' on 1 January 2023. The approach to and the impact of their adoption is discussed in note A2.1 of the IFRS financial statements. Key accounting policies discussed with the Committee over the course of the project include the determination of fulfilment cash flows used in the measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts, discount rates applied and the determination of coverage units used to determine revenue in respect of the release of the contractual service margin (CSM), which are set out in note A3.1, with further details on products and the measurement of CSM provided in note C3.4. The Committee received regular updates from both management and EY on the Group's development of its IFRS 17 accounting policies, its approach to transition and the production of its 2022 comparative results. It reviewed the proposed disclosure of 2022 comparatives alongside EY's report on its associated assurance activities in July prior to a briefing to the market, held on 20 July 2023, on the impact of IFRS 17.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the key assumptions and judgements supporting the Group's IFRS results, including those made in valuing the Group's investments, insurance contract balances and intangible assets. The Committee also reviewed the assumptions underpinning the Group's European Embedded Value (EEV) metrics.\n\n## Assumptions setting\n\nThe measurement of insurance contract balances is based on the best estimate of future cash flows, including those to and from policyholders, over a long period of time. These estimates can, depending on the type of business, be highly judgemental. The sensitivity of the Group's metrics to key economic and non-economic assumption changes is set out in note C6 for IFRS insurance contracts and note 3 for EEV. The Committee considered proposed changes to assumptions and other estimates in advance of the 2023 reporting. The key assumptions reviewed were:\n\n- - The persistency, mortality, morbidity (including expectations of future medical costs inflation and related premium rises) and expense assumptions (including consideration of future expense levels anticipated in the business plan) within insurance businesses. When assessing these assumptions, the Committee considered recent experience and whether adverse variances were expected to be short-term in nature; and\n- - Economic assumptions, including investment returns, associated risk discount rates for EEV and related illiquidity premiums for IFRS 17. Note A3.1 sets out the Group's approach to setting risk discount rates, incorporating illiquidity premiums, for IFRS 17.\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that the assumptions adopted by management were appropriate.\n\n## Valuation of investments\n\nThe Committee received information on the carrying value of investments in the Group's balance sheet which acknowledged that most of the Group's investments are based on quoted prices in an active market (81 per cent being included in level 1 as at 31 December 2023). Further information on the valuation of assets is contained in note C2 of the IFRS financial statements. Climate change does not directly impact fair values, particularly where these are built on observable inputs (ie are level 1 and 2), however the impact of environmental risks on the Group's assets and liabilities is discussed in more detail in note C6 of the IFRS financial statements, the Risk review report and the Sustainability report. The Committee agreed that overall investments were valued appropriately.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe Committee received information to enable it to review certain intangible asset balances, for example, whether there had been any indication of impairment of the Group's distribution rights asset or goodwill given the current macroeconomic environment. The Committee was satisfied that there was no impairment of those intangible assets at 31 December 2023. More information is contained in note C4 of the IFRS financial statements.",

Matters considered by the Committee in the year included:\n\n- - The detailed audit strategy for the year, approach to risk assessment and coverage of the audit response to highlighted significant risks;\n- - EY's approach to Group materiality setting and their proposal on how that is applied to individual business units;\n- - EY's knowledge around the key assumptions, and their insight and constructive challenge to management by highlighting where those assumptions sat on a range;\n- - Insight around the key accounting judgements and estimates and demonstration of professional scepticism in dealing with management; and\n\n## Going concern and viability statements\n\nThe Committee considered various analyses from management on the capital and liquidity positions at Group and parent company level, taking into account the Group's principal risks. This included an assessment of the impact that different stress scenarios may have on the Group's plan and its resilience to those threats. Following this review, the Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements should continue to be prepared on a going concern basis and that the disclosures in the 2023 Annual Report on the Group's longer-term viability were both reasonable and appropriate.\n\n## Alternative performance measure (APM)\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 17, the Group reaffirmed its belief that trends in underlying performance are better understood if the effects of short-term fluctuations in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates or equity markets, are excluded. This concept was previously applied under IFRS 4, but the changing measurement model under IFRS 17 has impacted how such short-term fluctuations are determined. The Committee reviewed and commented on the revised definition of adjusted operating profit as set out in note B1.2. The Committee also considered the prominence of disclosure and was satisfied that the disclosure of adjusted operating profit was not unduly prominent when compared with IFRS measures of performance, and that the adjusted operating profit was appropriately reconciled to IFRS measures in note B1.1.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable requirement\n\nThe Committee carried out a formal review of whether the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts were 'fair, balanced and understandable' as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. In particular, it considered whether the report gave a full picture of the Group's business model, strategy, financial position and performance in the year, with important messages appropriately highlighted. It also considered the level of consistency between financial statements and narrative sections, whether performance measures were clearly explained and the prominence of alternative performance measures. After completion of its detailed review, the Committee agreed that, taken as a whole, the Group's Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Committee regularly received updates on the Group's tax matters and provisions for certain open tax items, including tax matters in litigation. The Committee agreed that the level of provisioning adopted by management was appropriate. In 2023, the Committee was also updated on the OECD proposals to reform international tax including the introduction of a global minimum tax rate of 15 per cent, which will be partly effective for the Group in 2024 and fully effective for the Group from 2025. Further information is included in notes B3 and C7 of the IFRS financial statements.\n\n## Parent company financial statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed the parent company profit and loss account and balance sheet, which included the recoverability of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries by assessing and confirming that the net assets of the relevant subsidiaries (approximating their minimum recoverable amount) were in excess of their carrying value at the balance sheet date.\n\n## FRC's thematic review of the Group's interim IFRS 17 disclosures\n\nThe FRC's Corporate Reporting Review team carried out a limited scope review of the Group's half-year 2023 IFRS 17 disclosures in the first year of application. The review was based solely on the interim report and did not benefit from detailed knowledge of Prudential's business or an understanding of underlying transactions entered into, nor did it provide any assurance that the annual report and accounts are correct in all material respects. Following completion of the review, the Committee was provided with a letter from the FRC's Corporate Reporting Review team and was pleased to note that no questions or queries were raised. The Group has considered the matters raised in the thematic review when preparing the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.",

        "page_content": "## Principal activities and significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during 2023 continued\n\n## External audit continued\n\n- - The outcome of management's internal evaluation of the auditor and audit quality, which was based on a short questionnaire survey circulated to the Chief Financial Officer and a number of senior finance leaders. The short survey in 2023 covered audit quality and execution, team performance, process and communication in the halfyear 2023 assurance work as well as the audit of 2022 comparative results under IFRS 17. While areas of improvement were identified, no material concerns were raised.\n\nThe Committee maintains an open dialogue on emerging risks and issues with the Group Lead Partners via a regular schedule of meetings aligned to key reporting milestones. In 2023 the Committee formally met with the Group Lead Partners without management present on two separate occasions.\n\n## FRC and PCAOB audit quality inspection of EY\n\nWhen assessing the audit quality of EY, the Committee reviewed the inspection results published by regulators in the UK and the US. In July 2023, the FRC published its findings from the 2022-23 inspection of EY carried out by its Audit Quality Review (AQR) team, which showed an improvement in overall grade from prior years for both categories of 'all audits' and 'FTSE 350 audits' sampled. In November 2023, EY released findings from the PCAOB (Public Accounting Oversight Board) inspection related to the 2021 US audits, which showed a deterioration in findings rate from the previous year. The Committee discussed the findings with the EY team who noted enhancements had been made by the firm to address the issues raised by the PCAOB which would be applied to the Prudential plc 2023 audit with relevant members of the audit team being trained on the changes. Overall, the Committee was satisfied that the audit of Prudential plc remained effective.\n\n## Auditor independence and objectivity\n\nThe Committee monitors auditor independence and objectivity and is supported by the Group's Auditor Independence Policy (the Policy). The Committee reviews and approves any changes to the Policy annually. The Policy sets out the circumstances in which the external auditor may undertake non-audit services and is based on four key principles which specify that the auditor should not:\n\n- - Have a mutual or conflicting interest with the Group;\n- - Audit its own firm's work;\n- - Act as management or employees for the Group; or\n- - Be put in a position of being an advocate for the Group.\n\nThe Policy has two permissible service types: those that require specific approval by the Committee on an engagement basis and those that are pre-approved by the Committee with an annual monetary limit capped at no more than five per cent of the Group audit fee in the proposed year, and capped at $65,000 individually. Non-audit services undertaken by EY were agreed prior to the commencement of work and were confirmed as permissible for the external auditor to undertake in accordance with the Policy, which complies with the rules and regulations of the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the standards of the PCAOB.\n\nThe Committee monitored the nature and extent of non-audit services on a regular basis to ensure the provision of non-audit services complied with the Policy and did not impair the auditor's objectivity or independence. The Committee noted that EY typically only performed non-audit services where they complemented its role as external auditor, for example the review of half year and EEV financial statements or additional assurance to support capital market announcements.\n\nIn keeping with professional ethical standards, EY confirmed its independence to the Committee and set out the supporting evidence, such as details of non-audit services and the potential threats and related safeguards in providing those services, in a report that was considered by the Committee prior to publication of the financial results.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor developments to ensure the Group's policies and processes around audit effectiveness and independence evolve in line with market practice.\n\n## Fees paid to the external auditor\n\nThe fees paid to EY for the year ended 31 December 2023 since their appointment as the Group's statutory auditor amounted to $18.8 million, of which $3.8 million was total amounts payable in respect of non-audit services, except those required by law and regulation as defined by the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019). A breakdown of the fees payable to EY can be found in note B2.4 of the IFRS financial statements. The FRC cap on the ratio of non-audit fees over average audit fees for the past three years is not applicable for 2023 given this is the first year of EY being the Group's auditor.",

In all cases, EY was considered the most appropriate to carry out  the work, given its knowledge of the Group and the accumulated expertise that arose from running these  engagements alongside its main audit. All non-audit services were pre-approved by the Committee and were in line  with the Policy discussed above.

The Committee therefore recommended that EY be reappointed as the auditor, with John Headley remaining as the  Group Lead Partner. A resolution to this effect will be proposed to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.                                                                                |\n| Whistleblowing              | Speak Out The Group continues to operate a Group-wide whistleblowing programme ('Speak Out'), hosted by an independent  third party (Navex).

The  Committee also considered the consistency of approach adopted across subsidiary audit committees, where locally  recorded Speak Out events, themes and trends are also briefed and considered.

The Committee approved the plan for the second half of 2023. It also considered and approved the internal audit plan, resource and budget for the first half (H1) of 2024.\n\nThe H1 2024 Internal Audit Plan was based on a bottom-up risk assessment of audit needs. These were mapped against various metrics and are based on a top-down approach to compliance. The plan was then assessed against a series of risk and control parameters, including the top risks identified by the Risk Committee, to verify that it was appropriately balanced between financial, business change, regulatory and operational risk drivers and provides appropriate coverage of key risk areas and audit themes. Key areas of focus for this plan include: strategic change initiatives, customer outcomes, cyber security, financial risk and financial controls, culture, outsourcing and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Effectiveness of internal audit\n\nThe Committee is responsible for the approval of the GwIA charter, audit plan and resources, and monitors the effectiveness of the function.\n\nThe Committee also assesses the effectiveness of GwIA through a combination of External Quality Assessment (EQA) reviews, required every five years, and an annual quality assurance (QA) internal effectiveness review.\n\nThe last EQA review was conducted in Q4 2021, with GwIA being assessed as a mature function and receiving the highest rating (Generally Conforms) under the Institute of Internal Audit's framework. Having considered the findings of the 2023 internal effectiveness review, performed as an assessment by the internal audit function (supported by the engaged third party quality assurance team), the Committee concluded that GwIA had continued to operate independently of management and in compliance with the requirements of GwIA delegated authorities, procedures and practice standards in all material respects and had remained aligned to mandated objectives during 2023.\n\n## Internal control and risk management systems\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reporting and making recommendations to the Board on the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control.\n\nThe Committee considered the outcome of the annual review of the system of risk management and internal control. The review identified specific areas for improvement, particularly in respect of the general IT control environment, and the necessary actions that have been, or are being, taken.\n\n## Group Governance Manual\n\nThe Group Governance Manual (GGM), which includes the Group Code of Conduct, sets out the general principles by which Prudential conducts its business, the standards expected, and defines the Group-wide approach to governance, risk management and internal control.\n\nExemptions and breaches of mandatory requirements set out in the Group-wide policies and delegated authorities are monitored, and remedial actions are taken as necessary. The Committee received regular reports throughout the year. All staff and contingent workers are expected to provide a declaration confirming compliance with the Group Code of Conduct annually.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the results of the annual content review of the GGM and the report on exemption and breaches reported against Group policies for the year ended 31 December 2023.",

In particular, the Committee continued to monitor the confluence of macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe key risks and matters considered by the Committee are summarised in this letter, with more information included in the table below. In areas where risks are strategic or have broader impact, the Committee escalates to the Board for a wider discussion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough the Committee the Board has continued to provide strategic leadership, direction and oversight of the multi-faceted and often interconnected risks for the Group in a highly complex operating environment.\n\n## Committee operation and governance\n\nAs part of its duties detailed above, the Committee reviewed and approved the Group Risk Framework (GRF) to ensure that it remained effective in identifying and managing the risks faced by the Group in 2023. We considered and approved the Risk, Compliance and Security (RCS) function's planned activities for 2023 and received regular reports from the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer (CRCO). We also received regular reports from the Group-wide Internal Audit (GwIA) function and updates from other areas of the business as needed.\n\nThe Committee works closely with the Audit Committee to ensure both are updated and aligned in areas of common interest, and I report to the Board on the main matters discussed. The CRCOs of our Material Subsidiaries are also invited to present to the Committee on a rotational basis to help deepen the Committee's understanding of risks relevant to the local businesses. Regular direct communication and close cooperation with each of the Material Subsidiary risk committee chairs remain a key component of our governance framework, and at each meeting I update the Committee on important points raised at local level. In order to continue to foster a close working relationship with local audit and risk committees and deepen understanding of Group-wide risks, in October David Law and I chaired the annual conference attended by the non-executive directors of the Group's Material Subsidiaries.",

Risk governance, capital and liquidity\n\nThe Committee carried out its regular review of the Group's risk policies and proposed updates to the Group risk appetite statements and associated limits. We regularly monitored the strength of our capital and liquidity positions, including the results of stress and scenario analyses.\n\n## b. The Group's principal risks\n\nThe Committee considered the principal risks to the Group's financial viability, operational resilience and sustainability. These included geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic developments, including inflationary pressure, high interest rates, slowing economic growth, and an elevated cyber security threat globally. The Committee also considered the risks associated with the Group's transformation programmes and material joint ventures impacting the Group's risk profile. In addition, the Committee reviewed the Group's annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) report in May 2023 and indepth assessments were performed on existing and emerging highrisk areas. A detailed explanation of the principal risks facing the Group and the way in which these are managed is set out in the Risk review on pages 56 to 71.\n\n## Sustainability (including environmental, social and governance (ESG) and climate-related) risks\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on climate-related initiatives that support the Group's Sustainability Strategy. Reflecting our support for a just and inclusive transition to net zero, the Committee reviewed and recommended for approval, the Group's Climate Transition Plan, an updated carbon reduction target and a new target reflecting the Group's commitment to transition financing.\n\n## Change management risk\n\nFollowing the Group's adoption of IFRS 17, which came into effect on 1 January 2023, the Committee considered the risks associated with IFRS 17 implementation and the longer-term plans of embedding it into the business. The Committee also assessed the risks associated with the Group's other transformation programmes, including those driven by the Group's new strategy.\n\n## Information security, IT infrastructure and data privacy risks\n\nIn addition to receiving updates on the key risks associated with technology across the Group, including notable incidents, regulatory developments, governance and strategy, the Committee was regularly updated on Artificial Intelligence (AI), IT infrastructure, operations enhancement and the global cyber security threat landscape.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and approved a number of policies to strengthen technology risk management processes and governance, bolster the approach to managing technology risks relating to information security, data privacy and IT infrastructure, and define clearer roles and responsibilities within the organisation.\n\n## Third-party and outsourcing management risk\n\nWith an increasing reliance on third parties, strategic partnerships and bancassurance arrangements to deliver the Group's strategic outcomes, third-party risk management remains one of the key areas of focus for the Committee. It received regular updates on the Group's supplier and third-party risk oversight and progress on strengthening the Group's Third-Party Risk Oversight Framework. It also assessed the effectiveness of the Group's third-party risk governance.\n\n## Oversight of the Group's joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Committee also maintained oversight of key risks of the Group's joint ventures and associates. In 2023, the Group completed a series of deep-dive reviews on the Group's oversight of material insurance and asset management joint ventures and their contributions to the Group's risk profile, with the Committee evaluating the effectiveness of current oversight mechanisms and areas for potential improvement.\n\n## Group Internal Economic Capital Assessment\n\nThe 2023 Group Internal Economic Capital Assessment (GIECA) model results were presented to the Committee before being submitted to the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (Hong Kong IA). The updates considered key assumptions, recalibration of the Group risk appetite capital target, the governance framework and validation activity for the GIECA model. The Committee's main area of focus was on the use of the GIECA model. This model provides a consistent risk and return lens for capital allocation and decision-making across various business processes including business planning, product pricing, strategic business decisions and remuneration management.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe operation of the Committee was reviewed as part of the annual Board evaluation.  No material issues were identified.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members and Prudential's RCS function, both at Group and business unit level, in supporting the crucial work of the Committee in a complex macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory environment. I would like to give special thanks to David Law, who will resign from the Board in May 2024, having served diligently as a member of the Committee for seven years, and to welcome Mark Saunders who joins the Committee in April 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeremy Anderson Chair of the Risk Committee",

The Committee also received regular reports on the Group's exposure and management of its principal risks, emerging risk themes, material joint ventures impacting the Group's risk profile, and external developments within the CRCO's regular report to the Committee. Further information on how the Group identifies principal and emerging risks can be found in the Risk review.\n\nThe CRCO's reports provided the Committee with regulatory updates, including the implications of developing global capital standards, systemic risk regulation, engagement with regulators (including the Supervisory College) and the Group's ongoing compliance with the Hong Kong IA's Group-wide Supervision Framework as well as applicable local regulatory requirements.\n\n## Deep dives\n\nAs part of its risk oversight responsibilities, the Committee considered the results of deep-dive risk reviews performed over the year. In 2023, these reviews focused on: the risks relating to the Group's material joint ventures with particular emphasis on oversight management and key risks impacting the Group's risk profile, people risk, lessons learned following a series of stress events within the banking sectors in Q1 2023, the Group's exposure to sovereign default risk and other macroeconomic risks in Africa and an information security controls review in Africa. The Committee further considered ongoing effectiveness reviews of regulatory compliance, customer conduct and anti-money laundering, as well as updates on the Group's asset liability management processes and interest rates exposures.\n\n## Change management risk\n\nThe Committee monitored the progress of the Group's key strategic projects, which included the Group's new strategy and IFRS 17 implementation. The Group is undergoing significant strategic transformation, and the Committee noted the importance of management balancing the need to look after people whilst maintaining focus on the strategic outcomes.\n\nJoint meetings of the Risk Committee and Audit Committee in May and October led to both Committees being updated on the risks related to IFRS 17 implementation and on preparation activities for FY 2023 IFRS 17 reporting. The longer-term plans for embedding IFRS 17 into the business were also discussed.\n\n## Third-party and outsourcing management risk\n\nThe Committee considered an assessment of the effectiveness of the Group's third-party risk governance framework, and approved the list of the Group's material outsourcing arrangements prior to submission to the Hong Kong IA in May. The Committee received regular progress updates on the strengthening of the Group's Third-Party Risk Oversight Framework.\n\n## Information security, IT infrastructure and data privacy risks\n\nUpdates were provided to the Committee on key external developments relevant to cyber security and data privacy, including changes in regulations and the threat landscape. The Committee received regular progress updates on the operationalisation of the Group-wide governance model and the strategy for the management of information security and data privacy risks, as well as the  strengthening of IT infrastructure and operations resilience. The Committee was also informed of material incidents and improvement plans.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee approved the revised Group Information Security Policy, the new Group Information Technology Infrastructure Policy and the new Group Technology Risk Management Policy.\n\nJoint meetings of the Risk Committee and Audit Committee in May and October ensured both Committees were updated on the Group Data Policy and AI governance process as well as the progress of addressing critical operational challenges including material outsourcing.\n\n## Sustainability (including ESG and climate-related) risks\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on climate-related regulatory and legislative developments, including: those concerning disclosure requirements; progress against the Group's responsible investment commitments; and its ESG ratings by external assessors and agencies. These updates also reported back on the Group's participation in industry fora such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance; and consultations, including that of the International Sustainability Standards Board on its proposed standards for general sustainability and climaterelated disclosure requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Principal activities and significant issues considered by the Risk Committee during 2023 continued\n\n## Risk management continued\n\nPrudential has a long-term target to become a net zero asset owner by 2050 and in 2021 established a target to achieve a 25 per cent reduction in its Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) metric by 2025. In July, the Committee considered and recommended to the Board a new 2030 WACI reduction target of 55 per cent (compared to the 2019 baseline), reflecting a balance between ambition and uncertainty around the practicalities of implementation, as well as the Group's intention to support transition finance in emerging markets as part of a just and inclusive transition. The Board approved the changes, which were disclosed in the HY 2023 announcement. In December, the Committee considered the use of a 'Financing-the-Transition' target in executives' long-term incentive plans to underpin to the WACI target and recommended this to the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Committee also received reports on the Group ESG Data Governance Framework and the enhanced reporting processes and controls for non-financial ESG information during a joint meeting of the Risk Committee and Audit Committee held in December.\n\n## Control environment and risk culture\n\nRegular reports of any breaches of the Group's Non-Financial Risk Appetite, and mitigating actions, were provided to the Committee throughout the year. The Committee also received regular updates on risk culture enhancements including the roll-out of the revised Group Code of Conduct that outlines the ethical standards and responsibilities of the organisation and our employees, and associated training programmes. A joint meeting of the Risk Committee and Audit Committee was held in December, when a Group-wide control enhancement programme, which will be one of the key enablers for achieving operational discipline in the successful execution of the new strategy, was discussed.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Committee plays a formal role in advising the Remuneration Committee on the risk management considerations in respect of executive remuneration.

The plan concluded that the Group is expected to remain in a resilient financial and operational condition when under severe stress, with extreme stresses required to breach the Group's recovery activation measures, and that established governance frameworks and procedures are in place for senior management to respond to actual and potential threats.\n\n## Risk assessment of the business plan\n\nAs part of its role in overseeing and advising the Board on future risk exposures and strategic risks, the Committee reviewed the risk assessment of the business plan including the implementation of the Group's new strategy, which highlighted key financial and non-financial risks. The analysis included sensitivity assessments of the impact of two plausible scenarios.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on the Group-wide model risk assessment and model-risk-related activities, such as targeted model validations and model oversight assurance reviews to embed the model risk framework, reviews of model inventories in business units to ensure completeness and quality, and ongoing initiatives to improve model risk management.",

They also prepare the supplementary information which is on pages 342 to 361.\n\nBased on the audit of the financial statements and EEV basis supplementary information, the auditor must form an independent opinion on the performance of the Group and report this opinion to the Company and its shareholders. You can find the auditor's opinion on pages 330 to 339 and pages 362 to 363.\n\nDirectors have a legal obligation to prepare financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial affairs of the Company and the Group. The criteria used for the preparation of the financial statements can be found in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities on page 329. Company law also requires the Board to approve the Strategic report on page 149. The Strategic Report provides a description of the Group's capital position, financing and liquidity. The risks facing the Group's business are discussed in the Risk review on pages 56 to 71. Directors must also confirm that the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, including a description of the principal risks and uncertainties. This confirmation is in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities on page 329.\n\nThe Directors' statement must also confirm that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors' report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware; and that each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn line with guidance issued by the FRC in September 2014 on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting, and after making sufficient enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue their operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date that the financial statements are approved. Further information is provided in the Viability Statement on page 72 and the basis of preparation disclosure in the financial statements.\n\n## Powers of the Board\n\nThe Board may exercise all powers conferred on it by the Company's Articles (the Articles) and the Companies Act 2006.

Suitable insurance cover is in place in case of legal action against Directors and senior managers of companies within the Group.\n\nQualifying third-party indemnity provisions are also available for the benefit of the Directors of the Company and other relevant individuals within the Group.

The Committee operated within that policy in 2023 and intends to continue to do so during 2024.\n\nIn arriving at the remuneration outcomes for 2023, the Committee has assessed Company performance in the context of the wider stakeholder experience.\n\n## 2023 in summary\n\n## Company performance\n\nAs described in the Strategic Report  earlier in this Annual Report:\n\n- - We have seen strong financial performance in 2023;\n- - We have demonstrated substantial progress towards our 2027 objectives that were communicated alongside our updated strategy in August 2023; and\n- - Our performance reflects the breadth and broad-based nature of our markets and the strong capital position of the Group.\n\nThe charts opposite illustrate achievement against our key financial annual objectives.

For asset management businesses, it equates to post-tax operating profit for the year.\n- (3) In this report 'adjusted operating profit' refers to adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.\n- (4) Group cash flow includes business unit remittances net of dividends and corporate costs.\n\n## Stakeholders' experience\n\nIn reaching its decisions for 2023, the Committee considered the experience of the Group's stakeholders during the year, as set out below. More details about how we have listened to our stakeholders and what the Group delivered in 2023 can be found in the Sustainability Report section of the Strategic Report.\n\n## Investors\n\n- - 2023 was a year of  significant engagement with investors, with a new CEO, IFRS 17, the launch of an updated strategy and introduction of quarterly trading updates.\n- - The Group provided its strategy update alongside its half year 2023 results which was followed by an intensive programme of investor interaction.\n- -Engagement with investors: During 2023, over 589 meetings were held with around 475 individual institutional investors in Asia, the US, continental Europe and the UK. Of these meetings, 192 were attended by one or more of the Executive Directors.\n- -TSR performance was below the median of the peer group;  over the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 TSR was -21.0% while the median performance was -15.3%. This reflects the exposure to Asia-based headwinds inherent in Prudential's operating environment over the period and the fact that only one constituent of the 2021 PLTIP peer group operates substantially in the same markets as Prudential.\n\n## Our people\n\n- - Alongside our new purpose statement, our revised set of values, The PruWay, co-created by employees, was launched.\n- -As well as holding our third Group Wellness Day (now Prudential Recharge Day) in September 2023:\n- - We launched a digital coaching tool globally to provide holistic health and wellbeing personal ongoing support.\n- - We announced our sponsorship for This Is Me on World Mental Health Day.\n- - Engagement with our people included:\n- - Use of snap surveys for more timely feedback. Employee engagement scores remain at similar levels to January 2023.\n- -Over 7,400 colleagues participated in the Company's fourth Collaboration Jam, which focused on fostering engagement and awareness of The PruWay.\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group cash flow (AER) 4 (10%)\n\nCash flows across the Group reflect our aim of achieving a balance between ensuring sufficient net remittances from business units to cover the dividend and responsibly managing corporate costs to allow for reinvestment in profitable opportunities.\n\n2,149\n\n## Group operating free surplus generated 2 (15%)\n\nA measure of the internal cash generation of our businesses.",

Details of his remuneration are disclosed in the 'Annual report on remuneration' section of this report.  The remuneration for Mark FitzPatrick, the Interim CEO,  can also be found in this section.\n\nAs disclosed in last year's report, the Company agreed to replace remuneration forfeited by Mr Wadhwani as a consequence of his leaving his former employer.  The replacement awards are disclosed in the 'Recruitment arrangements' section.\n\n## 2023 Annual incentive Plan (AIP)\n\nStrong performance against the adjusted stretch targets of the financial metrics  led to a formulaic outcome of 100% of maximum on the financial scorecard. The Committee noted inputs from the Risk Committee and Audit Committee, and that the capital underpin had been met and approved the formulaic outcome of 100%.\n\nTaking into account the personal performance of the Executive Directors, this led to bonus outcomes of 99.0% and 97.4% of maximum for Anil and Mark respectively.\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Annual bonus outcomes for 2023' section.\n\n## Suppliers\n\n- - Prudential is committed to ensuring that slavery, human trafficking, child labour or any other abuse of human rights have no place in our organisation or supply chain. In 2023, we further enhanced our existing Group Third Party Supplier and Outsourcing Policy (GTPSO) to drive compliance to use our procurement and thirdparty risk management system, and to ensure that the Group's Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) framework is consistently applied.\n\n## Society\n\n- -Diversity and inclusion : New members of the Diversity and Inclusion Council were onboarded to focus on inclusion.  In 2023, we were listed on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth successive year.\n- -Prudence Foundation continued to invest in our communities. Highlights included:\n- - The Cha-Ching programme, which aims to raise financial literacy in children aged seven to 12 years old, had taught over two million children and had trained over 66,000 teachers.\n- - Our global SAFE STEPS programme, which aims to provide education, awareness and life-saving tips on climate and disaster risk preparedness, and road safety, reached over 100 million people in Asia and Africa in 2023.\n- - We engaged with the IAIS on climate-related risks, including taking part in discussions on this topic. During 2023, Prudential was the co-chair of the Institute of International Finance AsiaPacific Subgroup, with an agenda focusing on digital developments and climate-related risks in Asia markets.\n\n## 2021-2023 PLTIP\n\nAs a result of our performance over 2021-2023, the 2021 PLTIP vested at 27.58%. This reflected below threshold performance against the relative TSR targets, and above threshold performance on the Return on Embedded Value (RoEV) targets and strong performance against the sustainability scorecard. These awards are subject to a two-year holding period. Awards were adjusted to  take account of the Jackson demerger as set out in the 2021 Directors' remuneration report.\n\nThe Committee considered the Company's share price at the time the 2021 PLTIP awards were made (\u00a315.05/HKD164.07) compared to the share price at the end of the performance period (\u00a38.87/ HKD87.40). The share price in early 2024 did not increase and the Committee is satisfied that no windfall gains have arisen on vesting.\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Long-term incentives vesting in respect of performance to 31 December 2023' section.\n\nThe Committee carefully considered the formulaic outcomes for both the AIP and PLTIP in the context of the Group's financial performance and the stakeholder experience, as set out earlier in this statement, and determined that these were appropriate. As such, no discretion was applied in determining the AIP and PLTIP outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration for 2024\n\n## Strategic ambition\n\nA new purpose and strategy were announced alongside the 2023 interim results in August, which included an emphasis on operational and financial discipline to accelerate value creation.  The new strategy provides a  focus on investing in new business at attractive returns, core capabilities and strategic opportunities as well as returning capital to shareholders via dividends.\n\nA key focus of the Committee's work in 2023 has been to ensure the new strategy is embedded in the remuneration arrangements for 2024. The Committee therefore consulted with major shareholders, and shareholder representative bodies, on proposed changes to the weightings and metrics for the 2024 AIP and 2024 PLTIP, as well as on proposed changes to the remuneration arrangements for the CEO.\n\nResponses were received from shareholders, representing around 45% of the Group's share capital, with investors generally being supportive of the proposals. After careful consideration, and in order to ensure alignment with the new strategy, the Committee intends to implement the following changes to the 2024 AIP and 2024 PLTIP measures, and an increase in PLTIP award level for the CEO.\n\n## 2024 AIP and 2024 PLTIP measures\n\nWhile the Committee believes that the existing AIP measures remain appropriate, it decided to change the balance between the measures for 2024 to better reflect the refreshed strategy. Specifically, it approved an increased weighting for Operating Free Surplus Generation (OFSG) and Cash flow. Consequently, New Business Profit (NBP) will reduce, although it retains the highest weighting (at 45%), reflecting the Group's focus on future profitability.\n\nThe Committee believes that the PLTIP measures should closely align the economic interests of shareholders with those of executives and support the longer-term strategic ambitions of the Group. Consequently, it intends to:\n\n- - Retain Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as a measure, with an increased weight of 45%, which will ensure that maximum vesting only occurs where achievement of the Group's longer-term strategy generates shareholder value.\n- - Include Life and Asset Management Gross OFSG and NBP as measures (each with a weight of 15%), reflecting the two key financial objectives announced with the new strategy. The measures will replace RoEV. The Committee's view is that the ability to repeatedly demonstrate growth in NBP over a sustained period (through successive PLTIP cycles) is a key driver for value creation.  Similarly, continued growth in Life and Asset Management OFSG ensures a focus on profitable new business and managing experience variances over the longer term. Full vesting of the NBP and OFSG elements of the 2024 PLTIP will only be achieved if CAGR over the three-year performance period is aligned with our stated ambitions over the 2022 to 2027 period.\n- - Retain the Business Integrity Scorecard (with an unchanged weight of 25%), using the existing measures. As part of our support for a just and inclusive transition to net zero, the Board approved a target reduction in our portfolio's weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of 55% by 2030 (compared to the 2019 baseline). To support this ambition, the Committee has retained a WACI metric in the 2024 PLTIP and introduced a transition finance underpin for this element of the PLTIP.\n\nThe Committee is mindful that NBP and OFSG feature in both the 2024 AIP and 2024 PLTIP. However, on balance it believes this is appropriate given that these measures are central to the Group's strategic ambitions in both the short and longer term, and that performance will be measured over different periods.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements for the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Committee undertook a review of the remuneration package of the CEO and other senior executives to ensure they are adequate to attract, motivate and retain the high-calibre personnel required to deliver on our new purpose and strategy.  As part of the review, consideration was given to increasing the CEO's salary for 2024, reflecting his performance in the role to date, the passage of time since his original salary was set in May 2022 and the fact that it was unchanged for 2023.\n\nHowever, after careful deliberation, the Committee decided that it would be more appropriate to increase the CEO's 2024 PLTIP award level from 400% to 425% of salary, in lieu of a salary increase.\n\nThe increased PLTIP opportunity, which is well within the maximum allowable under the Policy, is wholly based on performance over the long term, thereby providing a greater focus than a salary increase would give on the achievement of the Group's strategic goals. The Committee therefore believes that this approach will, particularly in combination with the increased weight of TSR, serve to strengthen the alignment of the CEO's interests with those of other shareholders.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the impact that a low share price has on the number of shares under an award, which might give rise to a windfall gain in the future. After careful consideration the Committee decided to review the 2024 PLTIP award at vesting, when all factors can be assessed, to ensure that there has been no windfall gain. As part of this review, the Committee will consider Prudential's stretching performance targets, the share price performance of Prudential and its peers, the share price performance of indices on which Prudential is listed and any other factors deemed relevant to determining a final vesting outcome.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe operation of the Committee was reviewed in 2023 as part of the annual Board evaluation.  No material issues were identified.\n\n## Committee changes in 2023\n\nPhilip Remnant and Tom Watjen retired from the Board and the Committee at the 2023 AGM.  I would like to thank them both for their input and support on the Committee.  I would also like to welcome George Sartorel, who joined the Committee in May 2023. George has considerable operational expertise in insurance, mainly across the Asia Pacific region.\n\nI would like to thank the Committee members for their work over the past year in ensuring that our remuneration approach supports the Group's strategy and continues to  align with shareholder interests, especially when they have been asked to consider time-critical matters.\n\nI trust that you will find this report a clear account of the way in which the Committee has implemented the Directors' remuneration policy during 2023 and of the proposed Directors' remuneration arrangements for 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chua Sock Koong\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n19 March 2024",

The chart on the right shows the breakdown of the Chief Executive's remuneration based on a scenario of maximum AIP payout of 200% of salary and full vesting of an LTIP award of 425% of salary.\n\nPerformance-related remuneration is subject to malus (forfeiture or reduction before delivery) and clawback (recovery provisions for a period after delivery). The malus and clawback provisions are detailed in the Directors' remuneration policy.\n\n## Principles underlying the policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- - There are no incentive outcomes for below-threshold performance. Financial targets are set against the Board-approved plan.\n- - Under the PLTIP, 20 per cent of each portion of the award will vest for achieving threshold performance.\n- - The Committee approves termination arrangements of Executive Directors to ensure that there is no reward for failure.\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- - The structure comprises fixed remuneration, annual and long-term incentives only.\n- - The structure is largely unchanged from previous policies.\n- - There is a demonstrable link between performance and reward outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- - Executive Directors' pension benefit of 13 per cent of salary is aligned with that of the wider workforce.\n- - The conduct measure in the PLTIP ensures that there are no significant conduct/culture/governance issues that result in significant capital add-ons or material fines.\n- - The vesting period attached to the PLTIP reflects the time horizon of the business plan.\n- - The additional post-vesting holding period and share ownership guidelines align Executive Director interests with other stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Predictability\n\n- - The levels of awards under incentive arrangements to Executive Directors at threshold, on-target and maximum performance points are clearly defined and presented in relevant sections of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clarity\n\n- - The Committee consults regularly with the Company's largest shareholders on executive pay decisions before they are implemented.\n- - Details on Executive Director pay are clearly set out in the Annual report on remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk\n\n- - The  Risk Committee advises the Committee on risk management considerations to inform remuneration decisions.\n- - The Committee has flexibility to adjust incentive outcomes, and to apply malus and clawback to awards and incentive payments.\n- - The holding period on PLTIP awards extends the award time horizon to five years.\n- - In-employment share ownership guidelines provide a strong connection to the sustained success of the Company. Postemployment requirements continue the alignment with Company success and stakeholder interests.",

The Committee's role is to assist the Board in meeting its responsibilities regarding the determination, implementation and operation of the overall remuneration policy for the Group, including the remuneration of the Chair of the Board, Executive Directors, Group Executive Committee members and the Company Secretary, as well as overseeing the remuneration arrangements of other staff within its purview. In 2023, the Committee met 10 times and also dealt with a number of matters by email circulation.\n\nThe principal responsibilities of the Committee set out in its terms of reference and discharged during 2023 were:\n\n- - Approving the operation of performance-related pay schemes operated for the Executive Directors, other members of the Group Executive Committee and the Company Secretary, and determining the targets and individual payouts under such schemes;\n- - Reviewing and recommending the Directors' Remuneration Policy, applicable to all Directors of the Board, for approval by shareholders;\n- - Consulting with shareholders and the principal advisory bodies in respect of the Directors' remuneration policy ahead of its approval at the 2023 AGM, and discussing decisions taken in respect of the Executive Director's remuneration arrangements for 2024 (as discussed in the Annual statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee);\n- - Reviewing the operation and awards made under all share plans requiring approval by the Board and/or the Company's shareholders;\n- - Monitoring compliance of the Chair and Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee with share ownership guidelines;\n- - Reviewing and approving individual packages for the Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee including for any new hires and departures, and the fees of the Chair. Similarly, reviewing and approving fees for the Non-executive Directors of the Group's material subsidiaries;\n- - Reviewing workforce remuneration practices and related policies across the Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, as well as the alignment of incentives and awards with culture;\n- - Monitoring the remuneration and risk management implications of remuneration of senior executives across the Group and other selected roles; and\n- - Overseeing the implementation of the Group remuneration policy for those roles within scope of the specific arrangements referred to in the Hong Kong IA GWS Framework.\n\nThe Chair and the Chief Executive Officer attend meetings by invitation. The Committee also had the benefit of advice from the:\n\n- - Chief Risk and Compliance Officer;\n- - Chief Financial Officer;\n- - Chief Human Resources Officer; and\n- - Director, Group Reward and Employee Relations, and CHRO, UK.\n\nIndividuals are not present when their own remuneration is discussed and the Committee is always careful to manage potential conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management about executive remuneration proposals.\n\nDuring 2023, Deloitte LLP was the independent remuneration adviser to the Committee, having been appointed by the Committee following a competitive tender process during 2021. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants' Group and voluntarily operates under its code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK. Deloitte regularly meets with the Chair of the Committee without management present. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity. The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2023 were \u00a3136,100 charged on a fixed fee as well as a time and materials basis. During 2023, Deloitte provided Prudential management advice on remuneration, digital and technology, taxation, internal audit, global mobility, risk and regulatory matters. Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte. Management also received external advice and data from a number of other providers. This included market data and legal counsel. This advice, and these services, are not considered to be material.  During the latter part of 2023, a competitive tender process began for the provision of independent advice to the Committee.  The tender will conclude during 2024 and details will be provided in the Directors' remuneration report for 2024.\n\nIn 2023, the Board conducted an evaluation of its effectiveness, which included an assessment of the Remuneration Committee. No material issues were identified.",

Total variable remuneration includes total bonus, PLTIP awards vesting and variable remuneration elements of Mr Wadhwani's buyout.\n- ^ Each remuneration element is rounded to the nearest $1,000 and totals are the sum of these rounded figures. Total 2023 remuneration has been converted to US dollars using the exchange rate of 0.8041 for GBP and 7.8289 for HKD. Exchange rate fluctuations will therefore impact the reported value.\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Mr Wadhwani joined Prudential on 25 February 2023 and is paid in Hong Kong dollars. 'Other remuneration' consists of the value of replacement awards and payments made in relation to remuneration forfeited by Mr Wadhwani as a consequence of leaving his former employer, Manulife, and joining Prudential.  This includes compensation for salary, pension and housing benefit ($780k), as well as bonus ($1,637k), forfeited during the period between the end of his employment with Manulife and the commencement of his employment with Prudential, and the cost to him of buying out his notice period ($347k). The figure also includes an estimated value of those elements of Mr Wadhwani's replacement award (an option granted on 21 March 2023) that have no performance conditions or where the performance period ended in 2023 ($4,905k). The estimated value of the award has been calculated using the share price at the time of award (HKD124.30) for elements with no performance conditions, and the average share price over the last three months of 2023 (HKD84.82) for those elements with performance conditions. Target vesting has been used to value this latter element given that performance against the original Manulife targets is not yet known. The actual value, based on the actual share price at vesting and actual performance outcomes, will be shown in the 2024 report. Further details of Mr Wadhwani's buy-out can be found in the 'Recruitment arrangements' section later in this report.\n\n| $000s              | 2022 salary   | 2022 taxable benefits*   | 2022 total bonus\u2020   | 2022 PLTIP releases\u2021   |   2022 pension benefits\u00a7 | Total 2022 fixed remuneration~   | Total 2022 variable remuneration~   | Total 2022 remuneration the 'single figure'^   |\n|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick 1 | 1,352         | 314                      | 2,591               | 1,255                  |                      176 | 1,842                            | 3,846                               | 5,688                                          |\n| James Turner 2     | 1,051         | 914                      | 1,767               | 1,245                  |                      139 | 2,104                            | 3,012                               | 5,116                                          |\n| Mike Wells 3       | 366           | 249                      | 693                 | 2,108                  |                       48 | 663                              | 2,801                               | 3,464                                          |\n| Total              | 2,769         | 1,477                    | 5,051               | 4,608                  |                      363 | 4,609                            | 9,659                               | 14,268                                         |\n\n## Notes",

The 2023 average salary increases for other employees across the Group's businesses was 6 per cent.  In his role as Interim Group Chief Executive, Mark FitzPatrick received a monthly pensionable cash supplement of \u00a330,167 in addition to his base salary. This amount is included in the figure below.\n\nAs a result, Executive Directors received the following base salaries in 2023:\n\n| Executive Director                              | 2023 salary (local currency) from 1 January 2023  1   | 2023 salary (USD) 2 from 1 January 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Anil Wadhwani, Chief Executive Officer          | HK$12,281,000                                         | $1,569,000                                |\n| Mark FitzPatrick, Interim Group Chief Executive | \u00a31,209,000                                            | $1,504,000                                |\n\n## Notes\n\n## Pension benefit entitlements\n\nPension benefit arrangements for 2023 are set out in the table below.

The financial element of Executive Directors' 2023 bonuses was determined by the achievement of four Group measures, namely adjusted operating profit, operating free surplus generation, EEV new business profit and cash flow, which are aligned to the Group's growth and cash generation focus. The performance ranges were based on the annual business plans approved by the Board and reflected the ambitions of the Group, in the context of anticipated market conditions.\n\nPersonal objectives comprised 20 per cent of the bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors. These objectives were established at the start of the year for Mark FitzPatrick and on appointment for Anil Wadhwani. They reflect the Group's strategic priorities as set by the Board for 2023.\n\nAIP payments are subject to meeting minimum capital thresholds which are aligned to the Group risk framework and appetites (as adjusted for any Risk Committee approved counter-cyclical buffers), as described in the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report.\n\nThe Committee seeks advice from the Risk Committee on risk management considerations to inform decisions about remuneration architecture and performance measures to ensure that risk management, culture and conduct are appropriately reflected in the design and operation of Executive Directors' remuneration.",

This report confirmed that the 2023 results were achieved within the Group's and businesses' risk framework and appetite. The Chief Risk and Compliance Officer also considered the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, and specific actions taken to mitigate risks, particularly where these may be at the expense of profits or sales. The report also confirmed that the Group met minimum capital thresholds which were aligned to the Group risk framework and appetites. The Committee took into account this advice when determining AIP outcomes for Executive Directors.\n\nThe table below illustrates the weighting of performance measures for 2023 and the level of achievement under the AIP:\n\n|                    |                                                         |                     | Performance against  measures (% of max for each  component)   | Performance against  measures (% of max for each  component)   |                                          |                                  |                                 |               |                   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Executive Director | (% of total bonus opportunity) Group financial measures | Personal objectives | Group financial measures                                       | Personal objectives                                            | 2023 AIP  outcome (% of max opportunity) | Maximum 2023  AIP  (% of salary) | Actual 2023  AIP  (% of salary) | 2023 salary 2 | 2023 AIP  award 3 |\n| Anil Wadhwani 1    | 80%                                                     | 20%                 | 100 %                                                          | 95 %                                                           | 99.0 %                                   | 200%                             | 198.0 %                         | 1,332,299     | 2,637,953         |\n| Mark FitzPatrick 1 | 80%                                                     | 20%                 | 100 %                                                          | 87 %                                                           | 97.4 %                                   | 200%                             | 194.8 %                         | 226,562       | 441,343           |\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Committee determined the 2023 AIP awards on the basis of the performance of the Group and of the individual executives.

For all the financial metrics, the adjusted stretch targets established by the Board were exceeded.\n\nThe level of performance required for threshold, target and maximum payment against the Group's 2023 AIP financial measures and the results achieved are set out below:\n\n| 2023 AIP measure                       | Weighting   | Threshold ($m)   | Target ($m)   | Stretch target ($m)   | Achievement ($m)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Group adjusted operating profit        | 20%         | 2,513            | 2,645         | 2,777                 | 2,893              |\n| Group operating free surplus generated | 15 %        | 1,261            | 1,328         | 1,394                 | 1,395              |\n| Group cash flow                        | 10%         | 296              | 439           | 582                   | 756                |\n| Group EEV new business profit          | 55%         | 2,155            | 2,394         | 2,514                 | 3,125              |\n\nIn line with our long-established practice, the targets have been adjusted to reflect prevailing interest rate and foreign exchange rate assumptions applicable for the full year reporting of new business profit and other metrics. Adjustments to targets in any given year may be upwards or downwards and are designed to ensure that outcomes reflect management's performance in the year by neutralising the effect of interest rates and foreign exchange movements during that year.",

At its meeting in March 2024, it concluded that 2023 had seen the execution of significant strategic objectives, as described in the 'Strategic and Operating Review' section of the Annual Report.

In determining the financial targets, the Committee had regard to the stretching nature of the three-year business plan for return on embedded value and capital positions as set by the Board. Further, in setting the conduct and diversity targets under the sustainability scorecard, the Committee considered input presented by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer on behalf of the Risk Committee on conduct risk for the conduct measure and had regard to the Company's commitment under the Women in Finance Charter for the diversity measure.\n\nAs described in the 2021 Directors' remuneration report, the 2021 PLTIP award targets excluded Jackson performance, with the exception of the 'conduct' measure in the sustainability scorecard which includes Jackson performance until the point of demerger.  The TSR peer group was revised ahead of the 2021 awards being made in order to reflect the post-demerger footprint of the Group.\n\n## Performance assessment\n\nIn deciding the proportion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual results against performance targets. The Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate, including an assessment of whether results were achieved within the Group's risk framework and appetite. Finally, overall vesting levels were reviewed to ensure that levels of reward provided remain reflective of the Company's performance.\n\n|                                       | Weighting   | Threshold (20 per cent of award vests)   | Stretch (100 per cent of award  vests)   | Performance achieved                                                                                      | Vesting outcome   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| TSR 1                                 | 50%         | Median                                   | Upper quartile                           | Below median                                                                                              | 0 per cent        |\n| Return on  Embedded Value  (RoEV) 2   | 30%         | 8.9%                                     | 10.9%                                    | 9.0%                                                                                                      | 28.1 per cent     |\n| GWS operating  capital                | 5%          | $2,051 million                           | $2,507 million                           | Above stretch target                                                                                      | 100 per cent      |\n| ECap operating  capital  generation 4 | 5%          | $2,096 million                           | $2,562 million                           | Above stretch target                                                                                      | 100 per cent      |\n| Conduct 5                             | 5%          | Partial achievement                      | Stretch achievement                      | No conduct, culture or governance  issues that resulted in significant  capital add-ons or material fines | 100 per cent      |\n| Diversity 6                           | 5%          | 33.0%                                    | 37.0%                                    | 35.3%                                                                                                     | 83 per cent       |\n| Total                                 | 100%        | -                                        | -                                        | -                                                                                                         | 27.58 per cent    |\n\n## Notes\n\nDetails of cumulative achievement under the capital measures have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and disclosure would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors. The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Company's competitive position.\n\n## PLTIP vesting\n\nThe Committee considered a report from the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer which was approved by the Risk Committee. This report confirmed that the financial results were achieved within the Group's risk framework and appetite. On the basis of this report and the performance of the Group described above, the Committee decided that it was not appropriate to apply any adjustment to the formulaic vesting outcome of the 2021 PLTIP awards. The Committee determined the vesting of Mark FitzPatrick's PLTIP award as set out below:\n\n| Executive Director   | Percentage of the PLTIP award vesting   | Number of shares vesting 1   | Value of shares vesting 2   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick     | 27.58 %                                 | 28,930                       | $313,434                    |\n\n## Notes",

The peer group for 2023 PLTIP awards was revised from 2022 to further reflect the Group's strategic focus. Allianz, Axa, Sun Life Financial and Zurich Insurance were removed. The peer group is set out below (additions are denoted by an *):\n\n| AIA Group   | China Life Insurance           | China Pacific Insurance (CPIC)   | China Taiping Insurance   |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| DBS Group*  | Great Eastern                  | Hang Seng Bank                   | Manulife Financial        |\n| MetLife*    | New China Life Insurance (NCl) | Ping An Insurance                | Standard Chartered*       |\n\n## Return on Embedded Value Equity (RoEV)\n\nPerformance will be assessed on the average three-year Group RoEV relative to the 2023 to 2025 Board-approved plan. 20 per cent of the award will vest for achieving the threshold level of 9.2 per cent, increasing to full vesting for reaching the stretch level of at least 12.5 per cent.\n\n## Business integrity scorecard\n\nUnder the 2023 business integrity scorecard, performance will be assessed for each of the five measures at the end of the three-year performance period. Performance will be assessed on a sliding scale. Each of the measures has equal weighting and the 2023 measures are set out below:\n\n| Measure                                                 | Threshold performance 1 (20% vesting)      | Stretch performance 1 (100% vesting)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Reduction in weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) 2 | 25%                                        | 35%                                    |\n| GWS capital measure 3                                   | Threshold                                  | Stretch                                |\n| GIECA measure 3                                         | Threshold                                  | Stretch                                |\n| Diversity 4                                             | 35% female                                 | 40% female                             |\n| Conduct 5                                               | Partial achievement of Group  expectations | Achieving Group  expectations          |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (3) The targets for the GWS capital measure and the GIECA measure are deemed to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed in the 2025 Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Recruitment arrangements audited information\n\nAs detailed in the 2022 Directors' remuneration report, in order to facilitate Mr Wadhwani's appointment, the Company agreed to replace remuneration forfeited by him and reimburse costs he incurred as a consequence of his leaving his former employer, Manulife, and joining Prudential. Details of the recruitment arrangements are set out below.\n\n## Cash compensation\n\nThe Committee determined that it was appropriate and consistent with the Directors' remuneration policy to provide the following cash compensation payments to Mr Wadhwani which, while uncommon from a UK market perspective, given the nature of Mr Wadhwani's employment with Manulife, were necessary to facilitate his move to Prudential and ensure his timely appointment as Chief Executive Officer. Specifically, the Committee decided that it would be appropriate to reimburse Mr Wadhwani for the following amounts he forfeited on joining Prudential:\n\n- - The cost of Mr Wadhwani buying out his notice period with Manulife ($347,000);\n- - Salary, pension and housing benefit foregone during Mr Wadhwani's non-compete period ($780,000); and\n- - Bonus ($1.6 million) forfeited for the period from the start of the 2022 performance year to the commencement of Mr Wadhwani's employment with Prudential. This bonus is subject to a 40% deferral into Prudential shares for three years.\n\n## Replacement award\n\nA replacement award was made in relation to share-based awards made by Manulife that were forfeited. In line with the Directors' remuneration policy, the Committee is satisfied that the replacement award was made on a like-for-like basis with elements of the award subject to release in accordance with the original vesting time frames, and where applicable, satisfaction of the Manulife performance conditions attached to the original awards.\n\nThree types of forfeited awards were replaced:\n\n- - Performance shares were replaced at their maximum value (180% of target) but remain subject to satisfaction of the original Manulife performance conditions over the original performance period (to be determined by the Committee based on performance outcomes published in the relevant Manulife Management Information Circular expected to be published in March 2024 and March 2025 for the 2021 and 2022 awards respectively);\n- - Restricted shares were replaced at face value; and\n- - Market-value stock options were only replaced to the extent that they were 'in the money'.\n\nThe replacement award could not be made under any of the Company's existing incentive plans given the varying structures and terms of the forfeited awards. Therefore, the replacement award was made under a one-off award agreement entered into on 8 March 2023 in accordance with Rule 9.4.2 of the UK Listing Rules. The award comprised (i) a cash-settled nominal-cost option over Prudential shares, and (ii) replacement cash payments.\n\n- - Elements of the replacement award that would otherwise have vested before Mr Wadhwani joined the Company were settled in cash ($1.6 million), with a portion used to acquire shares, in Prudential, on behalf of Mr Wadhwani, in line with the requirements of the original Manulife awards.\n- - The nominal-cost option was granted to Mr Wadhwani on 21 March 2023 to replace the other forfeited Manulife awards in the following tranches:\n\n| Type of original award  and year of grant 1   | Replacement  award   | Date of grant   | No. of  notional  shares under  option   | Exercise  price (HKD)   | Face value 1 (USD)   | End of performance  period (if applicable)   | Vesting date Exercise period      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Performance shares                            |                      |                 |                                          |                         |                      |                                              |                                   |\n| 2021 2                                        | Nominal-cost         | 21 March        | 168,284                                  | 0.48                    | 2,671,857            | 31 Dec 2023 March 2024                       | 30 days from approval of  4       |\n| 2022 3                                        | option               | 2023            | 163,004                                  | 0.48                    | 2,588,026            | 31 Dec 2024 March 2025                       | vesting                           |\n| Restricted shares                             |                      |                 |                                          |                         |                      |                                              |                                   |\n| 2021 2                                        | Nominal-cost         | 21 March        | 62,706                                   | 0.48                    | 995,588              | n/a                                          | 2 Mar 2024 2 - 31 March 2024      |\n| 2022 2                                        | option               | 2023            | 60,738                                   | 0.48                    | 964,342              | n/a                                          | 1 Mar 2025 1 - 30 March 2025      |\n| Stock options                                 |                      |                 |                                          |                         |                      |                                              |                                   |\n| 2021 2                                        | Nominal-cost         | 21 March        | 7,820                                    | 0.48                    | 124,159              | n/a                                          | 5 Mar 2024 5 March - 3 April 2024 |\n| 2022 2                                        | option               | 2023            | 11,552                                   | 0.48                    | 183,412              | n/a                                          | 5 Mar 2025 5 March - 3 April 2025 |\n\n## Notes",

Clawback may be applied up to two years from vesting.\n- - If Mr Wadhwani leaves the Group, any unvested element of the nominal-cost option will normally lapse unless he leaves as a good leaver (as defined in the Directors' remuneration policy). If there is a takeover of Prudential the nominal-cost option may either vest early or be exchanged for an equivalent option over shares in the acquiring company.  If Mr Wadhwani is a good leaver or there is a takeover the extent to which the unvested element of the nominal-cost option will vest will be subject to the achievement of relevant performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, time pro-rating.\n- - The nominal-cost option may be adjusted if there is a variation in the share capital of Prudential or other corporate event. Changes to the advantage of Mr Wadhwani will not be made to the replacement award agreement unless shareholders give their consent to the change where the proposed change, if made in relation to a PLTIP award, would require shareholder approval. Benefits under these arrangements will not be pensionable or transferable.\n\n## Pay comparisons\n\n## Performance graph and table\n\nThe chart below illustrates the TSR performance of Prudential, the FTSE 100 (as the Company has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 index), and the peer group of international insurers which comprise the Company's TSR peer group for the 2023 PLTIP awards. The chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical investment of $100 in ordinary shares of Prudential plc over the 10-year period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2023 compared to a similar investment in the FTSE 100 or an index of the Company's peers. Total shareholder return is based on Returns Index data calculated on a daily share price growth plus reinvested dividends (as measured at the ex-dividend dates).\n\nPrudential TSR vs FTSE 100 and peer group average - total return over 10-year period to December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe information in the table below shows the total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer over the same period:\n\n| $000 1                                                            | 2014   | 2015    | 2015            | 2016    | 2017    | 2018                      | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    | 2022    | 2023     | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------------|---------|---------|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Chief Executive Officer 2,3                                       | TT     | TT      | MW              | MW      | MW      | MW                        | MW      | MW      | MW      | MW      | MFP     | MFP      | AW     |\n| Salary, pension and benefits                                      | 2,406  | 938     | 3,048           | 3,029   | 2,415   | 2,423                     | 2,122   | 2,126   | 2,249   | 663     | 1,476   | 447      | 1,986  |\n| Annual bonus payment                                              | 3,501  | 1,077   | 1,903           | 2,904   | 2,673   | 2,848                     | 2,804   | 1,355   | 3,057   | 693     | 2,161   | 441      | 2,638  |\n| (As % of maximum)                                                 | (100%) | (77.3%) | (99.7%)         | (99.5%) | (94%)   | (95%)                     | (96%)   | (46.0%) | (96.7%) | (96%)   | (98%)   | (97.4) % | (99) % |\n| LTIP vesting                                                      | 16,233 | 5,174   | 6,564           | 4,016   | 5,955   | 4,837                     | 2,746   | 4,286   | 1,052   | 2,108   | 1,255   | 313      | -      |\n| (As % of maximum)                                                 | (100%) | (100%)  | (100%)          | (70.8%) | (95.8%) | (62.5%)                   | (62.5%) | (68.8%) | (17.8%) | (45.5%) | (45.5%) | (27.6) % | -      |\n| Other payment 4                                                   | -      | -       | -               | -       | -       | -                         | -       | -       | -       | -       | -       | -        | 7,669  |\n| Chief Executive Officer  'single figure' of total  remuneration 5 | 22,140 |         | 7,189    11,515 |         |         | 9,950    11,042    10,109 | 7,671   | 7,768   | 6,358   | 3,464   | 4,892   | 1,201    | 12,293 |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) All remuneration has been converted to USD using the average exchange rate for each respective financial year.\n- (2) In years where there has been a change in Chief Executive Officer, the figures shown for each individual's remuneration in that year relate only to their service as Chief Executive Officer.\n- (3) The Chief Executive Officers are: TT : Tidjane Thiam MW : Mike Wells MFP : Mark FitzPatrick AW : Anil Wadhwani\n- (4) Other payment refers to the value of remuneration forfeited by Mr Wadhwani as a consequence of his leaving his former employer, that was provided by the Company.\n- (5) Further detail on the 'single figure' is provided in the 'single figure' table for the relevant year.

The changes in pay in 2022-23 reflect their pro-rated pay for 2022.\n\nThe regulations prescribe that this comparison should include all employees of the parent company. The number of individuals employed by the parent company is insufficient to be the basis of a representative comparison. Therefore the Committee has decided to use all UK-based employees as the basis for this calculation. The average pay for all employees has been calculated on a full-time equivalent basis by reference to the total pay awarded to UK employees in each year from 2023 back to 2019. The salary increase includes uplifts made through the annual salary review, as well as any additional changes in the year; for example to reflect promotions or role changes. The increase in the level of taxable benefit from 2022 to 2023 for employees reflects the extension of private medical cover offered to employees and the introduction of critical illness cover.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer pay compared with employee pay and gender pay gap\n\nAs reported in prior years, the UK headcount of Prudential Services Limited is below the 250-person threshold which triggers mandatory publication of the gender pay gap and the CEO pay ratio. Both the 2021 gender pay gap and the CEO pay ratio data were disclosed on a voluntary basis. After due consideration, we have decided that the UK gender pay gap and CEO pay ratio are not meaningful, given our relatively small employee headcount in the UK.",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration continued\n\n## Consideration of workforce pay and approach to engagement\n\nThe Committee believes that the approach to executive remuneration is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for other employees within the Group. The base salary and total remuneration levels for the Executive Directors and other employees are competitively positioned within the relevant markets and reflect the operation of our remuneration structures, which are effective in appropriately incentivising staff, having regard to our risk framework, risk appetites and to rewarding the 'how' as well as the 'what' of performance. During 2023, the Committee considered workforce remuneration and related policies in the businesses across the Group. Information presented to the Committee, by way of a dashboard, included how the Company's incentive arrangements are aligned with the culture and informed the Committee's decision-making on executive pay and policy. By way of example, employee salary increase budgets are considered as part of the year-end review of Executive Director compensation and salary increases.\n\nAs part of the Board's wider approach to employee engagement, which also included a Group-wide engagement survey, the Committee continues to take additional measures to explain how the remuneration of Executive Directors aligns with the wider Company pay policy. Directors' remuneration is considered appropriate compared to the wider workforce. In 2023, salary increases for other employees across the Group's businesses were 6 per cent while Executive Directors received 3 per cent salary increases in January 2023. Employee engagement is led by the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group. The Strategic Report describes how it discharged this responsibility during 2023.\n\nThe Group operates PRUSharePlus, an all-employee share purchase plan available to employees in 25 countries - 15 in Asia, eight in Africa and two in Europe - allowing our people to invest in the Company's shares. Similar Syariah-compliant plans are available in our Syariah business. Not only do these plans connect all employees to the success of the Company and interests of other shareholders, but they also mean that  many of our employees are shareholders and can therefore vote on remuneration-related resolutions at AGMs.\n\nAs part of our continuing efforts to safeguard our employees' wellbeing, we held our third Prudential Recharge Day on 15 September 2023. All employees Group-wide were encouraged to take the day as an extra day off to rest and recharge, and to spend time with family and friends, as referred to in the 'Stakeholders' experience' section.\n\n## Chair and Non-executive Director remuneration in 2023 audited information\n\nGiven the change to the geographic focus of the Group, it was felt to be more appropriate for the Non-executive Chair's and Non-executive Directors' fees to be denominated in our reporting currency (US dollars) rather than in sterling.  Major shareholders were consulted on this in July and were supportive of the change. The Directors' remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, anticipated this change.\n\nThe Chair and Non-executive Director fees were last increased in July 2022, in line with the increase awarded to Executive Directors in January 2022. No increases were made in 2023.\n\n## Chair fees\n\nShriti Vadera's fee was revised on 1 July 2022 by 3 per cent, to \u00a3788,000.  The fee was then re-denominated to US dollars with effect from 1 August 2023 to $966,000, using the average exchange rate for the six-month period 1 December 2022 to 31 May 2023 of 0.815806 and rounded to the nearest $1,000.\n\n## Non-executive Directors' fees\n\nThe Non-executive Directors' fees were re-denominated to US dollars with effect from 1 August 2023 on the same basis as the Chair's fee. Changes in US dollar amounts reflect changes in the exchange rate.\n\n| Annual fees                                          | From 1 July 2022 (\u00a3) 2   | From 1 July 2022 ($) 2   | From 1 August 2023 ($)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Basic fee                                            | 102,000                  | 126,000                  | 125,000                  |\n| Additional fees:                                     |                          |                          |                          |\n| Audit Committee Chair                                | 75,000                   | 93,000                   | 92,000                   |\n| Audit Committee member                               | 30,000                   | 37,000                   | 37,000                   |\n| Remuneration Committee Chair                         | 65,000                   | 80,000                   | 80,000                   |\n| Remuneration Committee member                        | 30,000                   | 37,000                   | 37,000                   |\n| Risk Committee Chair                                 | 75,000                   | 93,000                   | 92,000                   |\n| Risk Committee member                                | 30,000                   | 37,000                   | 37,000                   |\n| Nomination & Governance Committee Chair 1            | -                        | -                        | -                        |\n| Nomination & Governance Committee member             | 15,000                   | 19,000                   | 18,000                   |\n| Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group Chair  | 45,000                   | 56,000                   | 55,000                   |\n| Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group member | 22,000                   | 27,000                   | 27,000                   |\n| Senior Independent Director                          | 50,000                   | 62,000                   | 61,000                   |\n\n## Notes\n\nIf, in a particular year, the number of meetings is materially greater than usual, the Company may determine that the provision of additional fees is fair and reasonable.",

There were no additional payments to Directors for loss of office in 2023.\n\n## Arrangements for James Turner\n\nAs reported in 2022, James Turner stepped down from  the Board on 31 December 2022, but remained Group Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Group Executive Committee. Salary, pension and benefits continued to be paid to Mr Turner whilst he was a member of the Group Executive Committee. During this period, Mr Turner received benefits in respect of a tax liability, housing benefit and the cost of tax return preparation support (totalling $173,000), which related to periods he served while a Director of the Company. Details of remuneration arrangements associated with his stepping down from the Board were disclosed in full in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\nSubsequently, and as announced on 31 May 2023, James resigned as Chief Financial Officer in light of an investigation into a Code of Conduct issue relating to a recruitment situation. He remained available to the Group for a period of four months, to 30 September 2023, to support a smooth transition to his successor.\n\nThe Committee determined that any outstanding unvested long-term incentive awards would lapse at the end of Mr Turner's employment and that an adjustment may be made in the future to other awards, if appropriate in line with the provisions of the policy and in line with the rules of the relevant plans. Deferred bonus awards remain subject to the plan rules including malus and clawback provisions. The 'Post Directorship guidelines' under the Policy will continue to apply.\n\n## Arrangements for Mark FitzPatrick\n\nThe arrangements for Mark FitzPatrick during 2023 were implemented in line with the 2022 Directors' remuneration report and are detailed in the relevant sections of this report. Full details of remuneration arrangements associated with his stepping down from the Board were disclosed in full in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## Other Directors\n\nA de minimis threshold of \u00a310,000 has been set by the Committee; any payments or benefits provided to a past Director above this amount will be reported.\n\nAs disclosed in last year's Directors' remuneration report, Mike Wells stepped down as Chief Executive on 1 April 2022 and subsequently retired in July 2022. The treatment of his outstanding awards and other remuneration elements was disclosed in 2022. Mike holds a PLTIP award granted in 2021 and as set out in the 'Remuneration in respect of performance in 2023' the performance condition attached to this award was partially met and 27.58 per cent will be released in 2024.\n\n| Award   | Number of shares  vesting 1   | Value of shares  vesting 2   |\n|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| PLTIP   | 32,491                        | $352,015                     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) The number of shares vesting has been pro-rated to reflect time employed and includes accrued dividends.\n- (2) The share price used to calculate the value was the average share price for the three months up to 31 December 2023, being HKD84.82, converted into US dollars using an exchange rate of 7.8289.",

The votes received were:\n\n| Resolution                                               | Votes for     |   % of  votes cast | Votes against   |   % of  votes cast | Total votes cast   | Votes withheld   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| To approve the Directors' remuneration policy (2023 AGM) | 2,176,820,906 |              95.71 | 97,529,901      |               4.29 | 2,274,350,807      | 12,342,304       |\n| To approve the Directors' remuneration report (2023 AGM) | 2,096,173,741 |              94.69 | 117,660,098     |               5.31 | 2,213,833,839      | 72,859,272       |\n\n## Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2024\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's remuneration package was reviewed in 2023, with any changes effective from 1 January 2024. When the Committee made these decisions, it considered the expected salary increases budgeted for other employees in 2024, as well as external market reference points, to provide context to the Committee based on data for the 2024 TSR peer group, Asia-focused insurers and Asia financial services firms.\n\nAfter due deliberation and following consultation with shareholders, the Committee considered that there should be no increase to Mr Wadhwani's salary for 2024.  This compares to an average 4 per cent salary increase received by the wider Prudential workforce. On this basis, 2024 will be the twelfth consecutive year in which the increases generally offered to executives have been below or close to the bottom of the range of salary increases budgeted for the broader workforce.\n\nMr Wadhwani's annual salary, effective 1 January 2024, will remain as HKD12,281,000.\n\n## 2024 pension entitlements\n\nMr Wadhwani's pension benefits will remain aligned to the workforce rate, currently considered to be 13 per cent of salary. In addition, statutory contributions will continue to be made into mandatory pension arrangements in Hong Kong, in line with the local requirements.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## Award levels\n\nAnil Wadhwani will remain eligible for a maximum bonus opportunity of 200 per cent of salary.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nFor 2024, the AIP for the Chief Executive Officer will continue to be based 80 per cent on financial measures and 20 per cent on personal and strategic objectives. The financial AIP measures and weightings will change to align with the new strategy announced in 2023, increasing the focus on new business profit and operating free surplus generated, as described in the Committee Chair's statement. The resulting 2024 financial AIP measures and weightings are as follows:\n\n- - Group EEV new business profit - 45 per cent;\n- - Group adjusted operating profit - 20 per cent;\n- - Group operating free surplus generation - 20 per cent; and\n- - Group holding Company cash flow - 15 per cent.",

Please see the Committee Chair's statement for further information.\n\nThe Committee will review awards on vesting to ensure that participants do not benefit from windfall gains. The Committee will consider Prudential's stretching performance targets, the share performance of Prudential and its peers, the prices of the indices on which Prudential is listed and any other factors deemed relevant when determining vesting.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nPerformance conditions for the 2024 PLTIP award have been revised to ensure that they (together with the 2024 AIP measures) are aligned with the Company's strategic ambitions going forward. Consequently:\n\n- - NBP and Life and Asset Management Gross OFSG will be introduced as LTIP measures.  The ability to repeatedly demonstrate growth in NBP over a sustained period (ie through successive LTIP cycles) is a key driver for value creation.  Full vesting of the NBP and OFSG elements of the 2024 PLTIP will only be achieved if CAGR over the three-year performance period is aligned with our stated ambitions.\n- - The TSR measure will be retained, with a greater weighting to further enhance alignment with shareholders' interests.\n- - The business integrity scorecard will be retained with an unchanged weighting. In order to support our just and inclusive transition to net zero, the existing WACI measure will have an underpin based on the value of transition finance, which must be met for any part of the WACI measure to vest. This underpin will consider the value of qualifying investments committed to support the transition of the world to a lower carbon future.  Any vesting of this element of the PLTIP will be subject to both the Risk and Remuneration Committees being satisfied that the value of funds committed is appropriate after considering the broader economic environment over the performance period.\n\nThe measures, weightings and targets for the 2024 PLTIP awards for Mr Wadhwani are summarised below:\n\n| Measure                      | Weighting   | Threshold 1 20% vesting   | Maximum 100% vesting   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| Relative TSR 2               | 45%         | Median                    | Upper quartile         |\n| NBP 3                        | 15%         | $10,305m                  | $13,942m               |\n| Gross OFSG 4                 | 15%         | $8,279m                   | $11,202m               |\n| Business integrity scorecard | 25%         |                           | see below              |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (2) Relative TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of comparison.

This element is subject to a transition finance underpin which must be met before any part of the WACI element vests.\n- (2) Cumulative three-year GWS operating capital generation relative to threshold.\n- (3) Group Internal Economic Capital Assessment (GIECA) surplus generation is a Pillar 2 economic capital metric.\n\n- (5) Through strong risk management action, ensure there are no significant conduct/culture/governance issues that result in significant capital add-ons or material fines.\n\n## Chair and Non-executive Directors\n\nFees for the Chair and Non-executive Directors were reviewed in 2023 with no changes made, other than the re-denomination into US dollars effective from 1 August 2023, as set out in the 'Chairman and Non-executive Director remuneration in 2023' section. The next regular fee level review will be conducted in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chua Sock Koong\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 19 March 2024",

Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.\n\n## Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes\n\nUK-based Executive Directors are normally eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)-approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme. This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.\n\nParticipants are able to elect to enter into savings contracts of up to \u00a3500 per month for a period of three or five years. At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares. If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules. Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised. No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Company's ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.\n\n## Share Incentive Plan (SIP)\n\nUK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's Share Incentive Plan (SIP). All UK-based employees are able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of \u00a3150 per month from their gross salary (partnership shares) through the SIP. For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential plc on the open market. Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan. If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.\n\nThe table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with matching shares and dividend shares.\n\n|                    |   Year of initial  participation |   Share Incentive  Plan awards held  in Trust at 1 Jan 2023 (Number of shares) |   Partnership shares  accumulated in 2023 (Number of shares) |   Matching shares  accumulated in 2023 (Number of shares) |   Dividend shares  accumulated in 2023 (Number of shares) | Share Incentive  Plan awards held  in Trust at date of leaving  the Company (Number of shares)   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick 1 |                             2017 |                                                                            962 |                                                          134 |                                                        36 |                                                        15 | 1,147                                                                                            |\n\n## Note\n\nThis information has been prepared in line with the reporting requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and sets out Executive Directors' outstanding share awards and all-employee share plan options.",

        "page_content": "## Dilution\n\nReleases from the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan and the Prudential Agency Long Term Incentive Plan are satisfied using new issue shares rather than by purchasing shares in the open market. Shares relating to options granted under all-employee share plans are also satisfied by new issue shares. The combined dilution from all outstanding shares and options at 31 December 2023 was 0.13 per cent of the total share capital at the time. Deferred bonus awards will continue to be satisfied by the purchase of shares in the open market.\n\n## Remuneration of the five highest-paid individuals and the remuneration of senior management\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, the following table sets out, on an aggregate basis, the annual remuneration of i) the five highest-paid employees, and ii) senior management for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nOf the five individuals with the highest emoluments in 2023, one was an Executive Director for the majority of the year whose emoluments are disclosed in this report.

It is not the result attributable to shareholders principally because total corporate tax of the Group includes those taxes on the income of consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders. These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge under IAS 12. Consequently, the IFRS profit before tax measure is not representative of pre-tax profit attributable to shareholders.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## A Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\n## A1 Basis of preparation and exchange rates\n\nPrudential plc (the 'Company') together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Prudential') provides life and health insurance and asset management products in Asia and Africa. The Group is headquartered in Hong Kong.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards as issued by the IASB and UK-adopted international accounting standards. At 31 December 2023, there were no unadopted standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2023 which had an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, and there were no differences between UK-adopted international accounting standards and IFRS Standards as issued by the IASB in terms of their application to the Group.\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' (including any consequential amendments to other standards) as issued by the IASB and as adopted for use in the UK from 1 January 2023, as discussed in note A2.1. The transition date of the Group for IFRS 17 was 1 January 2022. Except for the changes from the adoption of these two standards and the new and amended IFRS Standards as described in note A2.2, the accounting policies applied by the Group in determining the IFRS financial results in these consolidated financial statements are the same as those previously applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 as disclosed in the 2022 annual report.\n\nThe parent company statement of financial position prepared in accordance with the UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (including Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework') is presented on page 322.\n\n## Going concern basis of accounting\n\nThe Directors have made an assessment of going concern covering a period to 31 March 2025, being at least 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are approved. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered both the Group's current performance, solvency and liquidity and the Group's business plan taking into account the Group's principal risks, and the mitigations available to address them, as well as the results of the Group's stress and scenario testing, as described further in the Risk review section (including the Viability statement).\n\nBased on the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue their operations for a period to 31 March 2025, being at least 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are approved. No material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company and the Group to continue as a going concern have been identified. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe exchange rates applied for balances and transactions in currencies other than the presentation currency of the Group, US dollars (USD) were:\n\n| USD : local currency    | Closing rate at year end   | Closing rate at year end   | Closing rate at year end   | Average rate for the year to date   | Average rate for the year to date   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                         | 31 Dec 2023                | 31 Dec 2022                | 1 Jan 2022                 | 2023                                | 2022                                |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)      | 7.09                       | 6.95                       | 6.37                       | 7.09                                | 6.73                                |\n| Hong Kong dollar (HKD)  | 7.81                       | 7.81                       | 7.80                       | 7.83                                | 7.83                                |\n| Indian rupee (INR)      | 83.21                      | 82.73                      | 74.34                      | 82.60                               | 78.63                               |\n| Indonesian rupiah (IDR) | 15,397.00                  | 15,567.50                  | 14,252.50                  | 15,230.82                           | 14,852.24                           |\n| Malaysian ringgit (MYR) | 4.60                       | 4.41                       | 4.17                       | 4.56                                | 4.40                                |\n| Singapore dollar (SGD)  | 1.32                       | 1.34                       | 1.35                       | 1.34                                | 1.38                                |\n| Taiwan dollar (TWD)     | 30.69                      | 30.74                      | 27.67                      | 31.17                               | 29.81                               |\n| Thai baht (THB)         | 34.37                      | 34.56                      | 33.19                      | 34.80                               | 35.06                               |\n| UK pound sterling (GBP) | 0.78                       | 0.83                       | 0.74                       | 0.80                                | 0.81                                |\n| Vietnamese dong (VND)   | 24,262.00                  | 23,575.00                  | 22,790.00                  | 23,835.92                           | 23,409.87                           |",

        "page_content": "## Foreign exchange translation\n\nIn order to present the consolidated financial statements in USD, the results and financial position of entities not using USD as functional currency (ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) must be translated into USD.\n\nAll assets and liabilities of entities not operating in USD are converted at closing exchange rates while all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on transaction dates. The impact of these foreign exchange translations into the Group's USD presentation currency is recorded as a separate component in the Statement of comprehensive income. Upon the disposal of the entity, the related cumulative foreign exchange translation differences are recycled from other comprehensive income to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nThe general principle for converting foreign currency transactions to the functional currency of an entity is to translate at the functional currency spot rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the spot exchange rate for the functional currency at the reporting date. Changes resulting from the foreign exchange translations into the functional currency of the entity are recognised in the income statement.\n\nCertain notes to the consolidated financial statements present comparative information at constant exchange rates (CER), in addition to the reporting at actual exchange rates (AER) used throughout the consolidated financial statements. AER are actual historical exchange rates for the specific accounting year, being the average rates over the year for the income statement and the closing rates at the balance sheet date for the statement of financial position. CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rate, ie current year average rates for the income statement and current year closing rates for the statement of financial position.\n\n## A2 New accounting pronouncements in 2023\n\n## A2.1 Adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', including any consequential amendments to other standards, from 1 January 2023.\n\n## IFRS 17, 'Insurance contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 introduces significant changes to the way insurance and reinsurance contracts are accounted for, albeit the scope of IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 is very similar. Therefore, nearly all of the Group's insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF) accounted under IFRS 4 are now accounted under IFRS 17.\n\nIFRS 4 permitted insurers to continue to use the statutory basis of accounting for insurance assets and liabilities that existed in their jurisdictions prior to January 2005. IFRS 17 replaces this with a new measurement model that establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF.\n\nInsurance contracts are aggregated into groups for measurement purposes. Groups of insurance contracts are determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts, each comprising contracts subject to similar risks and managed together, and dividing each portfolio into annual cohorts (ie by year of issue) and each annual cohort into groups based on the profitability of contracts. Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held are assessed for aggregation separately from portfolios of insurance contracts issued.\n\nWhen determining 'similar risks' the Group does not divide risks within a contract, eg riders sold under a single contract would not be split by risk type. The Group have therefore identified three broad categories of risks referred to as 'dominant' risks, namely, protection, investment and to a less material extent longevity. The requirement 'managed together' is assessed within the geographical boundary of each local business unit. Each ring-fenced fund is considered to be managed separately.\n\nUnder IFRS 17 groups of contracts are measured on initial recognition as the total of:\n\n- - Fulfilment cash flows, comprising the best estimate of the present value of future cash flows within the contract boundary that are expected to arise and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and\n- - A contractual service margin (CSM) that represents the deferral of any day-one gains arising on initial recognition.\n\nDay-one losses, any subsequent losses on onerous contracts and reversal of those losses arising from groups of insurance contracts are recognised directly in the income statement. For groups of reinsurance contracts held, any net gains or losses at initial recognition are recognised as CSM unless the net cost of purchasing reinsurance relates to past events, in which case such net cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nUnder IFRS 17 insurance contracts are measured under the General Measurement Model (GMM), Variable Fee Approach (VFA) or Premium Allocation Approach (PAA). The Group predominantly uses the VFA and GMM, depending on the specific characteristics of the insurance contracts. The Group makes very limited use of the PAA for some small portfolios of short duration contracts. Reinsurance contracts held are measured under the GMM.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nApproximately 72 per cent of the CSM (including joint ventures and associates and net of reinsurance) at transition (as described below) was calculated under the VFA and relates to the Group's with-profits and shareholder-backed participating products and unit-linked products with a low proportion of protection riders. The remaining approximately 28 per cent of the CSM at transition was calculated under the GMM and includes the Group's non-profit protection products and unit-linked products with a high proportion of protection riders.\n\nThe fulfilment cash flows are updated each reporting date to reflect current conditions. For contracts with direct participating features which are accounted for under the VFA, on initial recognition the CSM represents the variable fee to shareholders and it is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in economics as well as experience variances and/or assumptions changes that relate to future services. For contracts accounted for under GMM, the CSM is accreted using the discount rates determined at the date of initial recognition (the 'locked-in discount rates') and only adjusted to reflect the effect of non-economic experience variances and/or assumptions changes that relate to future services. The adjustments to the CSM for GMM business are determined using the locked-in discount rates. Further information on the subsequent measurement of the CSM is contained within note C3.4.\n\nIFRS 17 is applied retrospectively unless impractical to do so. The effect of adopting IFRS 17 retrospectively adjusts shareholders' equity as at the date of transition of 1 January 2022. At the transition date, the opening balance sheet for IFRS 17 is established, as set out in the section 'Effect of adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9' below.\n\nWith the adoption of IFRS 17, certain line items in the Group's consolidated statement of financial position have been replaced with new line items. For example, the Group now presents separately the carrying amount of portfolios of:\n\n- - Insurance contracts issued that are assets;\n- - Insurance contracts issued that are liabilities;\n- - Reinsurance contracts held that are assets; and\n- - Reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities.\n\nFurther, the line items in the consolidated income statement have been changed significantly compared with reporting under IFRS 4. In accordance with the IFRS 17 requirements, the following line items are no-longer reported: Gross premiums earned, Outward reinsurance premiums, Benefits and claims, Reinsurers' share of benefits and claims, Movements in unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and Acquisition costs. Those are replaced with the following IFRS 17 line items:\n\n- - Insurance revenue;\n- - Insurance service expenses;\n- - Net income (expense) from reinsurance contracts held; and\n- - Net insurance finance income (expenses).\n\n## Approach to transition to IFRS 17\n\nTransition refers to the determination of the opening balance sheet for the first year of comparative information presented under IFRS 17 (ie at 1 January 2022). The future cash flows and risk adjustment are measured on a current basis in the same manner as they would be calculated for subsequent measurement. The key component of transition is therefore the determination of the CSM.\n\nThe standard requires IFRS 17 to be applied retrospectively (the 'Full Retrospective Approach') unless impracticable. If a fully retrospective approach is impracticable there is an option to choose either a Modified Retrospective Approach or a Fair Value Approach. Prudential has adopted the Modified Retrospective Approach for cohorts of business for which expected cash flows at the date of initial recognition are not available but where actual historic cash flows are available. If reasonable and supportable information necessary to apply the modified retrospective approach is not available, the fair value approach must be applied.\n\nThe CSM of the groups of insurance contracts transitioned under retrospective approaches (ie full retrospective approach and modified retrospective approach) has been calculated as if the Group had only prepared annual financial statements before the transition date (ie transition CSM has been measured using a year-to-date approach).\n\n## Full Retrospective Approach (FRA)\n\nUnder the FRA, each group of insurance contracts has been identified, recognised and measured as if IFRS 17 had always applied. The CSM was calculated at initial recognition of a group of contracts based on the facts and circumstances at that time (ie without use of hindsight). This CSM was then rolled forward to the transition date in line with the requirements of the standard.",

A number of specific modifications are permitted under the MRA. The Group has adopted the following modifications:\n\n- - To use information at the transition date to identify insurance contract groups;\n- - To use information at the transition date to assess eligibility for the variable fee approach; and\n- - To use information at the transition date to identify discretionary cash flows.\n\n## General Measurement Model (GMM)\n\nUnder the MRA for GMM business, the cash flows at the date of initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts have been estimated as the cash flows at the earliest available date (ie the first year when the FRA is practicable, referred to as the 'earlier date'), adjusted by the cash flows that are known to have occurred between these two dates. A number of further specific modifications are permitted. The Group has adopted the following modifications:\n\n- - To estimate the risk adjustment at the date of initial recognition as the risk adjustment at the earlier date adjusted by the expected release of risk before that date based on the risk adjustment release pattern for similar contracts;\n- - To estimate CSM amortisation in line with run-off of the coverage units; and\n- - If there is a loss component at initial recognition, to estimate the amount allocated to the loss component before the transition date using a systematic allocation consistent with the modifications adopted above.\n\nDiscount rates at the date of initial recognition were determined using observable market data at that date.\n\n## Variable Fee Approach (VFA)\n\nUnder the MRA for VFA business, the CSM at the transition date for a group of insurance contracts has been determined as:\n\n- - The total fair value of the underlying items at that date; minus\n- - The fulfilment cash flows at that date; plus or minus\n- - An adjustment for:\n- - Amounts charged to policyholders before that date;\n- - Amounts paid before that date not varying with underlying items;\n- - The change in the risk adjustment caused by the release from risk before that date; and minus\n- - An estimate of the amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss for services provided before the transition date by comparing the remaining coverage units at the transition date with the coverage units provided under the group of contracts before the transition date.\n\nIn implementing this approach, the amounts charged to policyholders, the amounts paid not varying with underlying items and coverage units have been adjusted for the time value of money.\n\n## Fair Value Approach (FVA)\n\nThe insurance contracts of the Group under the FVA generally represent groups of contracts that were written many years ago where suitable historical information required to apply the retrospective transition approaches is no longer practicably available.\n\nUnder the FVA, the CSM at the transition date is the difference between the fair value of the insurance contracts, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, and the fulfilment cash flows at that date.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of groups of insurance contracts has therefore been interpreted as the compensation that a market participant would require for taking on the relevant obligation under the contracts.\n\nThe fair value has been determined using a cost of capital approach by reference to a quantum of capital required to be held in order to fulfil the contracts and a required return on that capital. Expected cash flows and the required locked-in capital are projected forward over the duration of the groups of contracts and discounted at the required rate of return. These calculations are based on the following key assumptions:\n\n- - The expected cash flows reflect the future cost that a market participant would expect to incur in fulfilling the obligations under the contracts. The fair value has been based on the same scope of cash flows as are included in the calculation of the best estimate liability. In particular, the same contract boundaries are assumed in the calculation of the fair value and best estimate liability. However, the measurement of those cash flows need not be the same.\n- - The required locked-in capital is the level of capital realistically required for a business to operate in the relevant jurisdiction.\n- - The required rate of return is compensation the Group would expect a market participant to require to enter into a transaction to transfer the liability associated with the insurance contracts at the transition date. This return has been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, including allowance for both financial risk and uncertainty in non-financial risk.\n\nA number of specific modifications are permitted under the FVA. The Group has adopted the following modifications:\n\n- - To use information at the transition date to identify groups of insurance contracts;\n- - To use information at the transition date to assess eligibility for the VFA;\n- - To use information at the transition date to identify discretionary cash flows;\n- - To use information at the transition date to assess whether a contract meets the definition of an investment contract with DPF; and\n- - To group annual cohorts of business.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nThe allocation of opening CSM by transition approach is given in note C3.2(b), alongside a segmental split.\n\n## IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments'\n\nIFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group met the eligibility criteria, under the amendments to IFRS 4 to apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9, deferring the initial application date of IFRS 9 to align with the initial application of IFRS 17.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has affected the following three areas:\n\n## The classification and the measurement of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 redefines the classification of financial assets. Based on the way in which the assets are managed in order to generate cash flows and their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest'), financial assets are classified into one of the following categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). An option is also available at initial recognition to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatches. The Company has made the election under IFRS 9 to measure its retained interest in Jackson at FVOCI. Under this designation, only dividend income from this retained interest is recognised in the profit or loss of the Company. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and there is no recycling to the profit or loss on derecognition. This was the only investment classified at FVOCI at 1 January 2023.\n\nA table explaining the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities as at 1 January 2023 is set out in the section 'Effect of adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9' below.\n\n## The calculation of the impairment charge relevant for financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI\n\nA new impairment model based on an expected credit loss approach replaced the incurred loss impairment model under IAS 39, resulting in earlier recognition of credit losses compared with IAS 39. This aspect is the most complex area of IFRS 9 and involves significant judgements and estimation processes.\n\nAs discussed above, the vast majority of the financial investments of the Group are held at FVTPL to which these requirements do not apply. Accordingly, no significant amount of additional impairment was recognised by the Group under the expected credit loss approach as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9.\n\n## The hedge accounting requirements which are more closely aligned with the risk management activities\n\nThe Group has not applied hedge accounting treatment under IAS 39 and therefore, there is no impact in this area for the Group upon the adoption of IFRS 9.\n\n## Effect of adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 has significant changes to the accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts, as discussed above. The Group's approach to transition to IFRS 17 is set out in the preceding section. The Group has restated the 2022 comparative amounts and presented a restated consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 9 has an insignificant impact on the Group's financial statements. As permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has not restated the comparatives on initial application of the standard but the Group is taking advantage of the classification overlay as permitted by the Amendment to IFRS 17, 'Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information' issued in December 2021. In accordance with this amendment, the balance sheet at 1 January 2022 reflects the change in classification of certain debt securities to amortised cost from fair value through profit and loss, certain loans to fair value through profit and loss from amortised cost and the recognition of IFRS 9 expected credit losses for certain mortgage loans that continue to be classified as amortised cost. With the exception of these changes, for which the overall net asset impact is insignificant at less than $5 million, the consolidated statement of financial position as of 1 January 2022 as restated under IFRS 17 has been presented to reflect the classification and measurement under IAS 39.\n\n## Consolidated statement of financial position at transition date 1 January 2022\n\nThe following table shows the Group's consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022 restated under the IFRS 17 basis and the summarised effects of the adoption of the new standard.",

Inclusion of insurance and reinsurance related receivable and payable balances within IFRS 17 insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities\n\n## -Policy loans\n\n- Applying the same IFRS 17 measurement principles described above, policy loans related cash flows including any accrued interest income (previously included in 'Accrued investment income') are also included within the fulfilment cash flows of the associated group of insurance contracts.\n\n## -Deferred tax liabilities\n\n- In line with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been netted as appropriate. The deferred tax liabilities arising from expected future distributions of the Singapore with-profits funds have been reclassified to be part of the insurance contract liabilities under IFRS 17.\n- (ii) The measurement changes shown in the table above principally reflect the following measurement differences arising from the adoption of IFRS 17:\n\n## -Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)\n\nAcquisition cash flows are taken into account in determining the day-one CSM of a group insurance contracts. As such, explicit assets for DAC are not required and the IFRS 4 balances are removed. DAC relating to investment contracts without discretionary participation features remains as an asset and has been reclassified to 'Other debtors' under 'Other non-investment and non-cash items'.",

For insurance entities in the Group, the current tax is calculated based on either the financial statements prepared under local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or the regulatory return prepared under relevant regulatory rules, or on an alternative basis (for example, Hong Kong, where most life insurance business is taxed by reference to net premiums). Current tax assets and liabilities at transition date are not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17 at Group level as the adoption for the Group financial statements has no impact on local tax calculations. For jurisdictions where the basis of tax is the local financial statements, current tax assets and liabilities will be calculated applying IFRS 17 if and when the standard is adopted locally, and subject to local tax rules for transitional adjustments. The impact of any such local adoption on the Group financial statements will be considered when relevant.\n- - Deferred tax balances are adjusted to reflect the deferred tax effects of the measurement adjustments arising from transition to IFRS 17 described above. The methods of calculating deferred tax are unchanged. Where insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities give rise to a tax deduction or taxable income when they are recovered or settled, measurement changes to these balances, without equal changes in current taxable income, give rise to corresponding changes to the deferred tax balances at the tax rates expected to apply when the deferred tax assets or liabilities are realised or settled.\n- -Investments in joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method\n- The adjustments represent the Group's share of the impact of the transition of the balance sheets of the Group's life joint ventures and associate (being CPL, India and the Takaful business in Malaysia) from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17, arising principally from the measurement differences as described above.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities by IFRS 9 category\n\nThe following table and the accompanying notes explain the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2022/1 January, 2023.\n\nThe effects of the reclassification of financial assets as a result of transition to IFRS 9 is not material.\n\n|                                                                                          | Classification at initial application   | Classification

Further details are provided in notes B3.2 and C7.2.\n\n## A3 Accounting policies\n\n## A3.1 Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements\n\nThis  note  presents  the  critical  accounting  policies,  estimates  and  judgements  applied  in  preparing  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements. Other accounting policies, where significant, are presented in the relevant individual notes. All accounting policies are applied consistently  for  the  years  presented  and  normally  are  not  subject  to  changes  unless  new  accounting  standards,  interpretations  or amendments are introduced by the IASB as discussed in note A2 above.\n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires Prudential to make accounting estimates and judgements about the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, which are both recognised and unrecognised (eg contingent liabilities) in the consolidated financial statements. Prudential evaluates its critical accounting estimates, including those related to insurance business provisioning and the fair value of assets as required. The notes below set out those critical accounting policies, the application of which requires the Group to make critical estimates and judgements. Also set out are further critical accounting policies affecting the presentation of the Group's results and other items that require the application of critical estimates and judgements.\n\n## (a) Critical accounting policies with associated critical estimates and judgements - Measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts under IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. It introduces a model that measures groups of contracts based on the Group's estimates of the present value of future cash flows that are expected to arise as the Group fulfils the contracts, an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk and a CSM. The process of determining the present value of future cashflows involves a number of estimates and judgments, which are set out below.",

This information  includes both internal and external historical data about claims and other experience, updated to reflect current  expectations of future events. As this is a prediction of the future, significant judgement is applied in determining  the assumptions that underpin the estimation of future cash flows. These assumptions include, but are not  limited to, operating assumptions such as morbidity, mortality, persistency and expenses, and economic  assumptions such as risk-free rates and illiquidity premium. Granular assumptions are set at a business unit level.  The demographic assumptions are consistent with those used in other metrics such as EEV reporting.

The amortisation of the bancassurance intangibles is considered to constitute insurance  acquisition cash flows. They generally form part of fulfilment cash flows and are amortised implicitly in line with  the coverage unit pattern.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining the point of  recognition and the  boundary of an  insurance contract | The point of initial recognition of a group of contracts is the earliest of the premium due date, the date coverage  starts and, for an onerous contract, the date the contract is signed and accepted by both parties.

The Group elects to determine discount rates on a bottom-up basis, starting with a liquid risk-free yield curve and adding an illiquidity premium to reflect the characteristics of the insurance contracts.\n\nRisk-free rates are based on government bond yields for all currencies except HKD where risk-free rates are based on swap rates due to the higher liquidity of the HKD swap market. Government bond yields and swap rates are obtained from publicly available data sources. Yield curves are constructed by using a market-observed curve up to a last liquid point and then extrapolating to an ultimate forward rate.\n\nWhere cash flows vary based on the return on underlying items, the projected earned rate is set equal to the discount rate. Where stochastic modelling techniques are used, the projected average investment returns are calibrated to be equal to the deterministic discount rate (including the illiquidity premium).\n\nThe illiquidity premium is calculated as the yield-to-maturity on a reference portfolio of assets with similar liquidity characteristics to the insurance contracts, (in particular, corporate bonds) less the risk-free curve, and an allowance for credit risk.\n\nThe allowance for credit risk includes a credit risk premium which is derived through a lifetime projection of expected bond cash flows, allowing for the cost of downgrades and defaults, a rebalancing rate of projected downgrades and a recovery rate in the event of default. The allowance for credit risk varies by currency ranging between 20bps and 56bps at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: between 23bps and 56bps) .\n\nA proportion of the reference portfolio's illiquidity premium (either 0%, 50% or 100%) is applied to portfolios of insurance contracts reflecting the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. The liquidity characteristics are assessed from the policyholders' perspective. Consideration is given to the nature of premiums, the level of underwriting, and the surrender and other benefit features of the portfolios. A product's illiquidity premium is restricted to be no greater than reasonably expected to be earned on the assets backing the insurance contract liabilities, over the duration of the insurance contracts.\n\nThe following tables set out the range of yield curves used to discount cash flows of insurance contracts for major currencies. The range reflects the proportion of illiquidity premium applied by business unit and portfolio.\n\n|                            | 31 Dec 2023 %   | 31 Dec 2023 %   | 31 Dec 2023 %   | 31 Dec 2023 %   | 31 Dec 2023 %   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                            | 1 year          | 5 years         | 10 years        | 15 years        | 20 years        |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)         | 2.07 - 2.33     | 2.41 - 2.67     | 2.59 - 2.85     | 2.70 - 2.96     | 2.76 - 3.02     |\n| Hong Kong dollar (HKD)     | 4.76 - 5.23     | 3.75 - 4.22     | 3.76 - 4.23     | 3.89 - 4.36     | 3.95 - 4.42     |\n| Indonesian rupiah (IDR)    | 6.47 - 6.96     | 6.63 - 7.12     | 6.73 - 7.22     | 6.94 - 7.43     | 7.03 - 7.52     |\n| Malaysian ringgit (MYR)    | 3.31 - 3.56     | 3.67 - 3.92     | 3.78 - 4.03     | 4.09 - 4.34     | 4.33 - 4.58     |\n| Singapore dollar (SGD)     | 3.62 - 4.37     | 2.67 - 3.42     | 2.71 - 3.46     | 2.77 - 3.52     | 2.74 - 3.49     |\n| United States dollar (USD) | 4.81 - 5.64     | 3.86 - 4.69     | 3.90 - 4.73     | 4.01 - 4.84     | 4.36 - 5.19     |\n\n|                            | 31 Dec 2022 %   | 31 Dec 2022 %   | 31 Dec 2022 %   | 31 Dec 2022 %   | 31 Dec 2022 %   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                            | 1 year          | 5 years         | 10 years        | 15 years        | 20 years        |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)         | 2.09 - 2.84     | 2.65 - 3.29     | 2.88 - 3.52     | 3.05 - 3.69     | 3.14 - 3.79     |\n| Hong Kong dollar (HKD)     | 4.85 - 6.14     | 3.96 - 5.25     | 3.78 - 5.07     | 3.82 - 5.11     | 3.84 - 5.13     |\n| Indonesian rupiah (IDR)    | 5.65 - 6.13     | 6.72 - 7.20     | 7.29 - 7.77     | 7.51 - 7.99     | 7.77 - 8.25     |\n| Malaysian ringgit (MYR)    | 3.52 - 3.91     | 3.91 - 4.29     | 4.13 - 4.52     | 4.35 - 4.73     | 4.49 - 4.88     |\n| Singapore dollar (SGD)     | 3.83 - 4.94     | 2.86 - 3.98     | 3.11 - 4.22     | 2.91 - 4.02     | 2.49 - 3.61     |\n| United States dollar (USD) | 4.75 - 5.91     | 4.02 - 5.17     | 3.89 - 5.05     | 3.98 - 5.15     | 4.27 - 5.43     |\n\n|                            | 1 Jan 2022 %   | 1 Jan 2022 %   | 1 Jan 2022 %   | 1 Jan 2022 %   | 1 Jan 2022 %   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                            | 1 year         | 5 years        | 10 years       | 15 years       | 20 years       |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)         | 2.21 - 2.60    | 2.63 - 2.99    | 2.81 - 3.19    | 3.00 - 3.65    | 3.12 - 3.71    |\n| Hong Kong dollar (HKD)     | 0.43 - 1.44    | 1.24 - 2.26    | 1.47 - 2.48    | 1.62 - 2.64    | 1.91 - 2.92    |\n| Indonesian rupiah (IDR)    | 3.43 - 4.81    | 5.55 - 6.93    | 7.04 - 8.42    | 7.43 - 8.81    | 7.74 - 9.12    |\n| Malaysian ringgit (MYR)    | 2.25 - 2.58    | 3.19 - 3.52    | 3.72 - 4.05    | 4.13 - 4.46    | 4.34 - 4.67    |\n| Singapore dollar (SGD)     | 0.60 - 1.58    | 1.38 - 2.35    | 1.72 - 2.70    | 1.99 - 2.97    | 2.14 - 3.12    |\n| United States dollar (USD) | 0.38 - 1.30    | 1.27 - 2.20    | 1.53 - 2.46    | 1.69 - 2.61    | 2.01 - 2.93    |\n\nThe sensitivity of shareholder equity and CSM to changes in interest rates is set out in Note C6.1(a), covers a sensitivity to changes in the discount rates.",

This is implemented through the use of provisions for adverse deviations (PADs) calibrated using non-financial risk distributions and correlation assumptions. The PADs are applied to best estimate assumptions and hence the risk adjustment is calculated on a contract by contract basis.\n\nThe Group's risk adjustment allows for all insurance, persistency and expense risks and operational risks specific to uncertainty in the amount and timing of insurance contract cash flows. Reinsurance counterparty default risk is excluded from the calculation. Diversification is included on a net of reinsurance basis within each insurance entity of the Group. Diversification is not allowed for between entities.\n\nBy applying a confidence level technique, the Group estimates the probability distribution of the expected present value of the future cash flows from insurance contracts at each reporting date and calculates the risk adjustment for non-financial risk as the excess of the value at risk at the 75th percentile (the target confidence level) over the expected present value of the future cash flows. The confidence level is calibrated over a one-year period.\n\n## Determination of coverage units\n\n## Coverage units\n\nThe proportion of CSM recognised in profit or loss at the end of each period for a group of contracts is determined as the ratio of:\n\n- - the coverage units in the period; divided by\n- - the sum of the coverage units in the period and the present value of expected coverage units in future periods.\n\nThe total number of coverage units in a group reflects the quantity of service provided determined by considering the quantity of benefits for each contract and its expected coverage period. The Group defines the quantity of benefits for insurance services as the maximum amount which a policyholder receives when an insured event takes place, for example the sum assured, the annual limit for a medical plan or the present value of a stream of payments. The quantity of benefits is updated each period. Investment related and investmentreturn services are assumed to be constant over time.\n\nWhere there are multiple different services in a group of contracts (for example both insurance and investment services are provided), the quantities of benefits for the different types of service are combined using weighting factors. These weighting factors are defined as the present value of expected outflows for each type of service, determined at a contract level.\n\nThe expected coverage period is the expected duration up to the contract boundary. The expected coverage period of the contracts in a group and the calculation of future coverage units allows for expected decrements (eg deaths and lapses) in each future period using current best estimate assumptions consistent with the best estimate liabilities (BEL) calculation.\n\nThe Group elects to allow for the time value of money by discounting future coverage units in the determination of the proportion of CSM recognised in profit or loss.\n\nDetermination of coverage units for groups of reinsurance contracts held follows the same principles as for groups of underlying contracts.\n\n## Insurance finance income and expenses\n\nDisaggregation between profit or loss and other comprehensive income\n\nIFRS 17 allows an accounting policy choice between:\n\n- - Including insurance finance income or expenses for the period in profit or loss; or\n- - Disaggregating insurance finance income or expenses for the period to include in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts, with the balance being included in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has made only very limited use of FVOCI accounting for assets. As discussed in note A2.1 under the heading 'The classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities', the only financial assets classified at FVOCI at 1 January 2023 was the Group's retained equity interest in Jackson, which have been subsequently disposed of. Consequently, the Group has not elected to disaggregate insurance finance income and expenses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income.",

The Group has chosen to present a measure of profit before tax attributable to shareholders which distinguishes between tax borne by shareholders and tax attributable to policyholders to support understanding of the performance of the Group.\n\nTotal tax charge for the Group reflects tax that relates to shareholders' profit and also tax attributable to policyholders through the interest in with-profits or unit-linked funds. Reported IFRS profit before the tax measure is therefore not representative of pre-tax profit attributable to shareholders. Accordingly, in order to provide a measure of pre-tax profit attributable to shareholders, the Group has chosen to adopt an income statement presentation of the tax charge and pre-tax results that distinguishes between policyholders' and shareholders' returns.\n\nProfit before tax attributable to shareholders is $2,097 million and compares to profit before tax of $2,272 million as shown in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Segmental analysis of results and earnings attributable to shareholders\n\nThe Group uses adjusted operating profit as the segmental measure of its results.\n\nTotal segmental adjusted operating profit is $3,517 million as shown in note B1.1.\n\nThe basis of calculation of adjusted operating profit is provided in note B1.2.\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's investments are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Shortterm fluctuations in the fair value of investments are only partially offset by the effect of economic changes on insurance contract assets and liabilities and so affect the result for the year. The Group therefore provides additional analysis of results before and after the effects of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with other items that are of a short-term, volatile or one-off nature.",

        "page_content": "## (c) Other items requiring application of critical estimates or judgements\n\n## VFA eligibility assessment\n\nThe Group applies judgements in assessing the VFA eligibility of contracts. Application of the VFA impacts the calculation of the CSM at the balance sheet date, which in turn impacts the future year's amortisation recognised in the income statement. Unlike the GMM approach, the VFA approach absorbs economic impacts within the CSM, rather than in the profit and loss account.\n\nThe total insurance and reinsurance CSM at the balance sheet date is $21,012 million, including joint ventures and associates, and the CSM amortisation, net of reinsurance, recognised in the income statement is $(2,208) million as shown in note C3.3(a). Approximately 72 per cent of the CSM (including joint ventures and associates and net of reinsurance) at transition was calculated under the VFA.\n\nIFRS 17 requires the use of the VFA for insurance contracts with direct participation features, ie substantially investment-related service contracts for which, at inception:\n\n- - the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- - the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n- - the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThe following key judgements have been made in assessing VFA eligibility:\n\n| Definition of substantial   | The term substantial is interpreted to mean greater than 50 per cent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Contractual terms           | In some circumstances contractual terms are implied by customary  business practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Granularity of assessment   | The assessment has been carried out at a contract level. However, to  the extent insurance contracts in a group affect the cash flows to  policyholders of contracts in other groups (referred to as  'mutualisation'), eligibility for the VFA has been assessed at the level  at which such mutualisation occurs (eg fund level). |\n| Calculation basis           | VFA eligibility assessments have been performed on a basis consistent  with how the Group measures its realistic expectations, for example  when pricing, monitoring or setting returns to policyholders.                                                                                                                           |\n\nContracts not qualifying for the VFA are accounted for under the GMM or PAA. The PAA is not used significantly within the Group.\n\nThe measurement model (VFA or GMM) used for key products is set out in Note C3.4(a).\n\n## Carrying value of distribution rights intangible assets\n\nThe Group applies judgement to assess whether factors such as the financial performance of the distribution arrangements, or changes in relevant legislation and regulatory requirements indicate an impairment of intangible assets representing distribution rights.\n\nTo determine the impaired value, the Group estimates the discounted future expected cash flows arising from the cash generating units (CGUs) containing the distribution rights.\n\nImpacts $3,709 million of assets as shown in note C4.2.\n\nDistribution rights relate to bancassurance partnership arrangements for the distribution of products for the term of the contractual agreement with the bank partner, for which an asset is recognised based on fees paid and fees payable not subject to performance conditions. Distribution rights impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication of an impairment.\n\nTo assess indicators of an impairment, the Group monitors a number of internal and external factors, including indications that the financial performance of the arrangement is likely to be worse than expected and changes in relevant legislation and regulatory requirements that could impact the Group's ability to continue to sell new business through the bancassurance channel, and then applies judgement to assess whether these factors indicate that an impairment has occurred.\n\nIf an impairment has occurred, a charge is recognised in the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is calculated as the present value of future expected cash flows from the asset or the CGUs to which it is allocated.",

Financial investments held at amortised cost primarily comprise loans and deposits and certain debt securities held by Eastspring.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS Standards are determined by the use of quoted market prices for exchange-quoted investments or by using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques. Further details are included in note C2.1.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arm's-length transaction. This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.\n\nQuoted market prices are used to value investments having quoted prices. Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties such as brokers or pricing services. Financial investments measured at fair value are classified into a three-level hierarchy as described in note C2.1.\n\nIf the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing services, or by using internally developed pricing models. Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and/or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date. Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments. Details of the financial investments classified as 'level 3' to which valuation techniques are applied and the sensitivity of profit before tax to a change in the valuation of these items, are presented in note C2.2.\n\n## A3.2 New accounting pronouncements not yet effective\n\nThe following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued by the IASB but are not yet effective for the Group in 2023.

There have been no changes to the Group's operating segments from those reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nOperations and transactions which do not form part of any business unit are reported as 'Unallocated to a segment' and generally comprise head office functions.\n\n## Performance measure\n\nThe performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Group is IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns (adjusted operating profit) as described below. This measurement basis distinguishes adjusted operating profit from other constituents of total profit or loss for the year, including short-term fluctuations in investment returns and gain or loss on corporate transactions. Note B1.1 shows the reconciliation from adjusted operating profit to total profit (loss) for the year.\n\nA comparison of the Group's 2022 adjusted operating profit under the previous IFRS 4 basis and the IFRS 17 basis is provided below:\n\n|                                                                | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| IFRS 4 basis adjusted operating profit as previously published | 3,375     |\n| Difference                                                     | (653)     |\n| IFRS 17 basis adjusted operating profit                        | 2,722     |\n\nIFRS 17 adjusted operating profit is circa $650 million lower than under IFRS4 in 2022. This broadly comprises:\n\n- - a circa $200 million reduction from the prohibition of day-one profit recognition from new business under IFRS17;\n- - a circa $250 million reduction from changes in the subsequent timing of profit recognition, mainly related to differences on protection products; and\n- - a circa $200 million reduction due to a one-off uplift in IFRS4 arising as a result of the adoption of Risk Based Capital in Hong Kong.\n\n## Determination of adjusted operating profit\n\n## (a) Approach adopted for insurance businesses\n\nThe measurement of adjusted operating profit reflects that, for the insurance business, assets and liabilities are held for the longer term. The Group believes trends in underlying performance are better understood if the effects of short-term fluctuations in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates or equity markets, are excluded. This concept was previously applied under IFRS 4, but the changing measurement model under IFRS 17 has impacted how such short-term fluctuations are determined.\n\nThe method of allocating profit between operating and non-operating components involves applying longer-term rates of return to the Group's assets held by insurance entities (including joint ventures and associates). These longer-term rates of return are not applied when assets and liabilities move broadly in tandem and hence the effect on profit from short-term market movements is more muted. In summary the Group applies the following approach when attributing the 'net investment result' between operating and non-operating profit:\n\n- - Returns on investments that meet the definition of an 'underlying item', namely those investments that determine some of the amounts payable to a policyholder such as assets within unit linked funds or with-profits funds, are recorded in adjusted operating profit on an actual return basis. The exception is for investments backing the shareholders' 10 per cent share of the estate within the Hong Kong with-profits fund. Changes in the value of these investments, including those driven by market movements, pass through the income statement with no liability offset. Consequently adjusted operating profit recognises investment return on a longer-term basis for these assets.\n- - For insurance contracts measured under the GMM, the impact of market movements on both the non-underlying insurance contract balances and the investments they relate to are considered together. Adjusted operating profit allows for the long-term credit spread (net of the expected defaults) or long-term equity risk premium on the debt and equity-type instruments respectively. Deducted from this amount is the unwind of the illiquidity premium included in the current discount rate for the liabilities.\n- - Some GMM BEL components are calculated by reference to the investment return of assets, even if the BEL component itself is not considered an underlying item, for example the BEL component related to future fee income or a guarantee. In these cases for the purposes of determining operating profit, the BEL component is calculated assuming a longer-term investment return and any difference between the actual return arising in the period and the longer-term investment return is taken to non-operating profit. There is no impact on the balance sheet of this allocation.\n- - A longer-term rate of return is applied to all other investments held by the Group's insurance business for the purposes of calculating adjusted operating profit. More details on how longer-term rates are determined are set out below.\n\nThe difference between the net investment result recorded in the income statement and the longer-term returns determined using the above principles is recorded as 'short-term fluctuations in investment returns' as a component of non-operating profit.\n\nThe 'insurance service result' is recognised in adjusted operating profit in full with the exception of gains or losses that arise from market and other related movements on onerous contracts measured under the variable fee approach. If these gains and losses are capable of being offset across more than one annual cohort of the same product or fund as applicable, then the adjusted operating profit is determined by amortising the net of the future profits and losses on all contracts where profits or losses can be shared. Any difference between this and the insurance service results presented in the income statement is classified as part of 'short-term fluctuations in investment returns', a component of nonoperating profit.",

        "page_content": "## (b) Determination of longer-term returns\n\nThe longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations. These rates are broadly stable from year to year but may be different between regions, reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each business unit. The assumptions are for the returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions. The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.\n\nFor collective investment schemes that include different types of assets (eg equities and debt securities), weighted assumptions are used reflecting the asset mix underlying the relevant fund mandates.\n\n## Debt securities and loans\n\nFor debt securities and loans, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term government bond yield, plus the estimated long-term credit spread over the government bond yield, less an allowance for expected credit losses. The credit spread and credit loss assumptions reflect the mix of assets by credit rating. Longer-term rates of return range from 2.8 per cent to 8.4 per cent for 2023 (2022: 2.8 per cent to 7.8 per cent).\n\n## Equity-type securities\n\nFor equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns for income and capital. Longerterm rates of return range from 8.6 per cent to 15.7 per cent for 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Derivative value movements\n\nIn the case where derivatives change the nature of other invested assets (eg by lengthening the duration of assets, hedging overseas bonds to the currency of the local liabilities, or by providing synthetic exposure to equities), the longer-term return on those invested assets reflects the impacts of the derivatives.\n\n## (c) Non-insurance businesses\n\nFor these businesses, the determination of adjusted operating profit reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements and excludes market related items only where it is expected these will unwind over time.\n\n## B1.3 Analysis of adjusted operating profit by driver\n\nManagement assesses adjusted operating profit by breaking it down into the key components that drive performance each period. This analysis changes from the previous IFRS 4 driver breakdown as the new IFRS 17 measurement model leads to different drivers being relevant. The new basis is not directly reconcilable to the old basis.\n\nThe table below analyses the Group's adjusted operating profit into the underlying drivers using the following categories:\n\n- - Adjusted release of CSM, which is net of reinsurance, represents the release from the CSM for the insurance services provided in the period adjusted for the reduction in CSM release that would occur if gains on profitable contracts were combined with losses on onerous contracts for those contracts where gains and losses can be shared across cohorts as described in note B1.2.\n- - Release of risk adjustment, which is net of reinsurance, represents the amount of risk adjustment recognised in the income statement representing non-financial risk that expired in the period net of the amount that was assumed to be covered by under any reinsurance contracts in place. The only difference between the amount shown in the table below and the amount included within Insurance service result on the consolidated income statement and note C3.2 is the amount relating to the Group's life joint ventures and associates that use the equity method of accounting.\n- - Experience variances represent the difference between the actual amounts incurred or received in the period and that assumed within the best estimate liability for insurance and reinsurance contracts. It covers items such as claims, attributable expenses and premiums to the extent that they relate to current or past service.\n- - Other insurance service result primarily relates to movements on onerous contracts that impact adjusted operating profit (ie excluding those discussed in B1.2).\n- - Net investment result on longer-term basis comprises the component of the 'net investment result' that has been attributed to adjusted operating profit by applying the approach as described in note B1.2.\n- - Other insurance income and expenditure represent other sources of income and expenses that are not considered to be attributable to insurance contracts under IFRS 17.\n- - Share of related tax charges from joint ventures and associates represents the related tax on the adjusted operating profit of the Group's life joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method. Under IFRS, the Group's share of results from its investments in joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method is included as a single line in the Group's profit before tax on a net of related tax basis. In the table below, the results of the life joint ventures and associates are analysed by adjusted operating profit drivers and on a pretax basis, with related tax shown separately in order for the contribution from the life joint ventures and associates to be included in the profit driver analysis on a consistent basis with the rest of the insurance business operations.",

The insurance revenue relating to services provided for each period represents the total of the changes in the liability for remaining coverage that relate to services for which the Group expects to receive consideration and comprises the following items.\n\n- - A release of the CSM, measured based on coverage units;\n- - Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to current services;\n- - Claims and other insurance service expenses for the period expected at the beginning of the year; and\n- -Other amounts include the revenue recognised to cover the tax charge attributable to policyholders and other items, for example experience adjustments for premium receipts for current or past services.\n\nIn addition, the Group allocates a portion of premiums that relate to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows to each period using the same amortisation factor used to amortise CSM. The Group recognises the allocated amount, adjusted for interest accretion, as insurance revenue and an equal amount as insurance service expenses.\n\nNon-distinct investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.\n\nPolicy fees charged on investment contracts without discretionary participation features for asset management and policy administration fees are recognised when related services are provided.",

associates including CPL that are equity accounted for is presented in a single line within the Group's profit before tax on a net of related tax basis, and therefore not shown in the analysis of revenue line items above. Revenue from external customers of CPL (Prudential's share) in 2023 is $560 million (2022: $595 million). Further financial information on CPL is provided in note D5.3.\n\n- (iii) Other revenue comprises revenue from external customers and consists primarily of revenue from the Group's asset management business of $299 million (2022: $330 million). Also included in other revenue is fee income on financial instruments that are not held at FVTPL of $3 million (2022: $2 million).\n- (iv) Due to the nature of the business of the Group, there is no reliance on any major customers. Of the Group's markets, other than Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia as shown above, no individual markets have revenue from external customers that exceeds 10 per cent of the Group total for the years presented.",

Net realised gains and losses on the Group's investments for 2023 recognised in the income statement amounted to a net loss of $(6.0) billion (2022: a net loss of $(9.4) billion).\n\nThe overall financial strength of Prudential and the results, both current and future, of the insurance business are in part dependent upon the quality and performance of the various investment portfolios. Prudential's insurance investments support a range of businesses operating in many geographic areas. Each of the operations formulates a strategy based on the nature of its underlying liabilities, its level of capital and its local regulatory requirements. Prudential's insurance business's investments, excluding assets to cover linked liabilities and those attributable to external unit holders of consolidated investment funds, are largely held by Prudential's Singapore and Hong Kong operations.\n\nAll investments are carried at fair value in the statement of financial position with fair value movements, which are volatile from period to period, recorded in the income statement, except for loans and receivables which are generally carried at amortised cost (unless designated at FVTPL), and the Group's retained interest in Jackson which was, prior to its disposal in 2023, classified as FVOCI under IFRS 9 (designated as AFS under IAS 39). Subject to the effect of the exceptions, the year-on-year changes in investment returns primarily reflect the generality of overall market movements for equities and debt securities. In addition, foreign exchange rates affect the USD value of the translated income. Consistent with the treatment applied for other items of income and expenditure, investment return for operations not using USD as functional currency is translated at average exchange rates. The year-on-year movements in investment return of the Group mainly reflect the cumulative impact from the changes in interest rates on bond asset values and in the performance of the equity markets.",

The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options, and financial equivalence to value all awards other than those which have TSR performance conditions attached (some Prudential LTIP and RSP awards) for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of these conditions. These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.\n\nFor all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities as quoted on Bloomberg. The Prudential specific atthe-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.\n\nRisk-free interest rates are taken from swap spot rates with projection terms matching the corresponding vesting periods. For awards with a TSR condition, volatilities and correlations between Prudential and a basket of 12 competitor companies is required. For grants in 2023, the average volatility for the basket of competitors was 26 per cent (2022: 26 per cent). Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns for the three years prior to the valuation date. Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the basket of competitors. Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.\n\nOther awards, without market performance conditions or exercise price, are valued based on grant date share price.\n\n## (d) Share-based payment expense charged to the income statement\n\nThe total expense recognised in 2023 in the consolidated financial statements relating to share-based compensation is $81 million (2022: $104 million), of which $71 million (2022: $97 million) is accounted for as equity-settled.\n\nThe Group had $31 million of liabilities at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $27 million) relating to share-based payment awards accounted for as cash-settled.",

        "page_content": "## B3 Tax charge\n\nPrudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years. The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the consolidated financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions. Otherwise, provisions are established based on the likely amount of the liability, or recovery, by providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple outcomes.\n\nThe total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders. The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds. In certain jurisdictions, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders' profits and on their policyholders' insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products. Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Group's Consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the Consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.\n\nDeferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 'Income Taxes' does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## B3.1 Total tax charge by nature\n\nThe total tax charge in the income statement is as follows:\n\n|                                               | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hong Kong                                     | (129)     | (106)     |\n| Indonesia                                     | (43)      | (27)      |\n| Malaysia                                      | (98)      | (44)      |\n| Singapore                                     | (174)     | (61)      |\n| Growth markets and other                      | (103)     | (210)     |\n| Eastspring                                    | (26)      | (26)      |\n| Total segment  note (i)                       | (573)     | (474)     |\n| Unallocated to a segment (central operations) | 13        | (4)       |\n| Total tax charge  notes (i)(ii)               | (560)     | (478)     |\n\n## Notes\n\n|                                                                                           | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current tax expense:                                                                      |           |           |\n| Corporation tax                                                                           | (457)     | (474)     |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                                     | 1         | (7)       |\n| Total current tax charge                                                                  | (456)     | (481)     |\n| Deferred tax arising from:                                                                |           |           |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                                         | (135)     | -         |\n| Adjustment in respect of a tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference from a prior year | 31        | 3         |\n| Total deferred tax (charge) credit                                                        | (104)     | 3         |\n| Total tax charge                                                                          | (560)     | (478)     |",

The tax rates on adjusted operating profit for Growth markets and other and the Group total as shown in the table above differ from the equivalent tax rates previously published under IFRS 4 for 2022 due primarily to differences in the proportions of adjusted operating profit contributed by entities with different tax rates. Actual tax rates on profit before tax for 2022 prepared under IFRS 17 differ from the equivalent tax rates previously published under IFRS 4 for 2022 primarily due to non-taxable and non-deductible amounts, such as investment gains or losses, making up a different proportion of total profit before tax for each segment and the Group total under each standard.\n\nA number of jurisdictions in which the Group has operations - Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Vietnam and the UK - have implemented either a global minimum tax or a domestic minimum tax at a rate of 15 per cent, in line with the OECD proposals, effective for 2024 onwards. Malaysia has implemented both the global minimum tax and domestic minimum tax effective for 2025 onwards. Other jurisdictions where the Group has a taxable presence, including Hong Kong (where Prudential plc has been tax resident since 3 March 2023), Singapore and Thailand intend to implement the proposals for 2025 onwards.\n\nFor those jurisdictions where either a global minimum tax or domestic minimum tax or both have been implemented with effect for 2024, no material impact to the Group's IFRS tax charge for the 2024 financial year is expected. The implementation of a global minimum tax and domestic minimum tax in Malaysia effective for 2025 is not expected to have a material impact for the Group's IFRS tax charge for the 2025 financial year. These assessments consider a number of factors including whether the transitional safe harbour is expected to apply based on the most recent filings of tax returns, country by country reporting and financial statements of the relevant entities. In some jurisdictions a global minimum tax but not a domestic minimum tax regime has been implemented and the Group's operations in that jurisdiction will not be subject to the rules as they are wholly domestic operations.\n\nLuxembourg and South Korea have both implemented an undertaxed profits rule effective for 2025 onwards. The undertaxed profits rule is intended as a backstop provision to deal with jurisdictions which delay or do not implement the global minimum tax or domestic minimum tax rules. In the December 2023 public consultation and February 2024 budget, Hong Kong confirmed its intention to implement the global minimum and domestic minimum tax rules effective from 2025 onwards. As the Hong Kong rules are expected to be in force for 2025 and would apply to the Group from 2025, the undertaxed profits rules implemented in South Korea and Luxembourg are not expected to have any practical application to the Group. For those jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, where the proposals are expected to be implemented with effect from 2025 onwards, work is ongoing to assess the potential impact and guidance will be provided in due course during 2024.\n\n## B4 Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated based on earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, after related tax and non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in employee share trusts, which are treated as cancelled. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. No adjustment is made if the impact is anti-dilutive overall.",

The second interim dividend will be paid to shareholders recorded on the UK register at 6.00pm (British Summer Time) and to shareholders on the HK branch register at 4.30pm (Hong Kong Time) on 2 April 2024 (Record Date), and also to the Holders of US American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) as at 2 April 2024. The second interim dividend will be paid on or about 23 May 2024 to shareholders with shares standing to the credit of their securities accounts with The Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP) at 5.00pm (Singapore Time) on the Record Date.\n\nShareholders holding shares on the UK or HK share registers will continue to receive their dividend payments in either GBP or HKD respectively, unless they elect to receive dividend payments in USD. Elections must be made through the relevant UK or HK share registrar on or before 24 April 2024. The corresponding amounts per share in GBP and HKD are expected to be announced on or about 2 May 2024. The USD to GBP and HKD conversion rates will be determined by the actual rates achieved by Prudential buying those currencies prior to the subsequent announcement.\n\nHolders of ADRs will continue to receive their dividend payments in USD. Shareholders holding an interest in Prudential shares through CDP in Singapore will continue to receive their dividend payments in SGD at an exchange rate determined by CDP.\n\nShareholders on the UK register are eligible to participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.",

The Group uses the middle of the Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch ratings, where available. Where ratings are not available from these rating agencies, local external rating agencies' ratings and lastly internal ratings have been used. Securities with none of the ratings listed above are classified as unrated and included under the 'below BBB- and unrated' category. The total securities (excluding sovereign debt) that were unrated at 31 December 2023 were $1,181 million (31 December 2022: $1,152 million). Additionally, government debt is shown separately from the rating breakdowns in order to provide a more focused view of the credit portfolio.\n\nIn the table below, AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB- ratings. Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as below BBB-.\n\nThe following table classifies assets into those that primarily back the Group's participating funds that are measured under the variable fee approach, those backing unit-linked funds, other investments held within the insurance entities, Eastspring's investments and those that are unallocated to a segment (principally centrally held investments).\n\nIn terms of the investments held by the insurance businesses, those within funds with policyholder participation and those within unit-linked funds represent underlying items. The gains or losses on these investments will be offset by movements in policyholder liabilities and therefore adjusted operating profit reflects the actual investment return on these assets. The exception is for investments backing the shareholders' 10 per cent share of the estate within the Hong Kong with-profits fund. Changes in the value of these investments, including those driven by market movements, pass through the income statement with no liability offset. Consequently adjusted operating profit recognises investment return on a longer-term basis for these assets.\n\nIn terms of other assets held within the insurance entities, these largely comprise assets backing IFRS shareholders' equity or are non-underlying items backing GMM liabilities and therefore the returns on these other investments are recognised in adjusted operating profit at a longer-term rate.",

        "page_content": "## C2 Measurement of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets. The Group holds financial assets in accordance with IFRS 9 (2023) / IAS 39 (2022 and prior) whereby subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories:\n\n- - Financial instruments at FVTPL: this comprises primarily instruments that are managed and the performance evaluated on a fair value basis, including liabilities related to net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated investment funds and policyholder liabilities for investment contracts without discretionary participation features. In addition, this includes derivatives. All investments within this category are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement.\n- - Financial instruments at FVOCI under IFRS 9 or on an AFS basis under IAS 39: these instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest and/or dividend income is recognised in the income statement. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses except for equity securities that have been elected to be designated at FVOCI under IFRS 9 whereby there is no recycling to the profit or loss on derecognition being the difference to the AFS treatment for equity securities under IAS 39. Subsequent to the demerger of Jackson in September 2021, the Group designated its retained interest in Jackson as AFS equity securities under IAS 39. Upon the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group made the election to measure its interest in equity securities in Jackson at FVOCI, which were disposed of entirely in 2023. There were no financial instruments at FVOCI at 31 December 2023.\n- - Financial instruments at amortised cost: these instruments comprise non-quoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments, including loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, and other receivables. These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. When assets held at amortised cost are subject to impairment testing, estimated future cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the asset. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial asset's original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred. If, in subsequent periods, an impaired loan or receivable recovers in value (in part or in full) and this recovery can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment, then any amount determined to have been recovered is reversed through the income statement.\n\n## C2.1 Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS Standards are determined by the use of quoted market prices for exchange-quoted investments, or by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques. Climate change does not directly impact fair values particularly where these are built on observable inputs (ie level 1 and level 2), which represent the majority of the Group's financial instruments as discussed below.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arm's-length transaction. This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.\n\nThe fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the Group is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.\n\n## Valuation approach for level 2 fair valued assets and liabilities\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities. These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using a designated independent pricing service or quote from thirdparty brokers. These valuations are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as comparison to multiple pricing sources where available, monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.\n\nWhen prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers. Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability. The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.\n\nGenerally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties. Adjustments are made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value (eg either because the value is stale and/or the values are extremely diverse in range). Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.\n\n## Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities\n\nInvestments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions, eg market illiquidity.\n\nThe Group's valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by Business Unit committees as part of the Group's wider financial reporting governance processes. The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues. In addition, the Group has minimum standards for independent price verification to ensure valuation accuracy is regularly independently verified. Adherence to this policy is monitored across the business units.",

This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.\n\nAll assets and liabilities held at fair value are classified as FVTPL at 31 December 2023. At 31 December 2022, $266 million of financial assets classified as AFS under IAS 39 related to the Group's retained interest in Jackson, which was disposed of in 2023. All assets and liabilities held at fair value are measured on a recurring basis.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\n|                                                                               | 31 Dec 2023 $m                                | 31 Dec 2023 $m                                            | 31 Dec 2023 $m                                                          | 31 Dec 2023 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                               | Level 1                                       | Level 2                                                   | Level 3                                                                 | Level 3          |\n|                                                                               | Quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets | Valuation based  on significant  observable market inputs | Valuation based  on significant  unobservable  market inputs note (iii) | Total            |\n| Loans                                                                         | -

Transfers are deemed to have occurred when there is a material change in the observed valuation inputs or a change in the level of trading activities of the securities.\n\nDuring 2023, the transfers between levels within the portfolios included transfers from level 1 to level 2 of $505 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of $1,708 million. These transfers primarily reflect the change in the observed valuation inputs of equity securities and debt securities and, in certain cases, the change in the level of trading activities of the securities. There were transfers from level 2 to level 3 of $1,489 million in the period relating to certain of the underlying investments of the Group's consolidated investment funds, which are now deemed to have more unobservable inputs.\n\n## Reconciliation of movements in level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nThe following table reconciles the value of level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities at the beginning of the period to that presented at the end of the period.\n\nTotal investment return recorded in the income statement represents interest and dividend income, realised gains and losses, unrealised gains and losses on the assets classified at fair value through profit and loss and foreign exchange movements on an individual entity's overseas investments. Total gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income comprises the translation of investments into the Group's presentational currency of US dollars.\n\n|                                                    | 2023 $m   | 2023 $m                                                          | 2023 $m         | 2023 $m     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|                                                    | Loans     | Equity securities  and holdings in collective investment schemes | Debt securities | Group total |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                   | 3         | 824                                                              | 38              | 865         |\n| Total gains in income statement  note              | -         | 25                                                               | 2               | 27          |\n| Total gains recorded in other comprehensive income | -         | 6                                                                | -               | 6           |\n| Purchases and other additions                      | -         | 524                                                              | -               | 524         |\n| Sales                                              | (3)       | (4)                                                              | -               | (7)         |\n| Transfers into level 3                             | -         | 1,489                                                            | -               | 1,489       |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                                  | -         | 2,864                                                            | 40              | 2,904       |\n\n|                                                     | 2022 $m   | 2022 $m                                                          | 2022 $m          | 2022 $m     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n|                                                     | Loans     | Equity securities  and holdings in collective investment schemes | Debt  securities | Group total |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                    | 5         | 577                                                              | 58               | 640         |\n| Total losses in income statement  note              | (2)       | (31)                                                             | (2)              | (35)        |\n| Total losses recorded in other comprehensive income | -         | (6)                                                              | (3)              | (9)         |\n| Purchases and other additions                       | -         | 305                                                              | -                | 305         |\n| Sales                                               | -         | (21)                                                             | -                | (21)        |\n| Transfers (out of) level 3                          | -         | -                                                                | (15)             | (15)        |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                                   | 3         | 824                                                              | 38               | 865         |\n\n## Note\n\nOf the total net gain in the income statement of $27 million at 2023 (2022: net loss of $(35) million), $29 million (2022: $(12) million) relates to net unrealised gains and losses of financial instruments still held at the end of the year, which can be analysed as follows:\n\n|                                                                                            | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans                                                                                      | -         | (2)       |\n| Equity securities and holdings in collective investment schemes                            | 27        | (8)       |\n| Debt securities                                                                            | 2         | (2)       |\n| Net unrealised gains and losses of financial instruments still held at the end of the year | 29        | (12)      |",

All the assets and liabilities in the table above have been classified within level 2 at 31 December 2023 and 2022, reflecting the observability of the inputs used to derive their fair value. The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the Group is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.\n\n## C2.3 Additional information on financial instruments\n\n## (a) Financial risk Liquidity analysis\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's financial assets are held to back the Group's policyholder liabilities. Although asset/liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities (both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments), this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk. Within each business unit, this asset/liability matching is performed on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis. In terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Group's liabilities are expected to be held for the long term. Much of the Group's investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets. For the reasons provided above, an analysis of the Group's assets by contractual maturity is not considered meaningful to evaluate the nature and extent of the Group's liquidity risk.\n\n## Contractual maturities of financial liabilities on an undiscounted cash flow basis\n\nThe following table sets out the contractual maturities for applicable classes of financial liabilities, excluding derivative liabilities that are separately presented. The financial liabilities are included in the column relating to the contractual maturities of the undiscounted cash flows (including contractual interest payments) based on the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay assuming conditions are consistent with those of year end.

The Group has no cash flow hedges and, in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, accrued investment income and other debtors. Further details of collateral in place in relation to derivatives, securities lending, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other transactions are provided in note (c) below. The Group's exposure to credit risk is further discussed in the Risk review report.\n\nThe majority of Group's financial instruments are carried at FVTPL. The total value of assets held at amortised cost is $12,933 million (31 December 2022: $13,947 million), comprising primarily cash and cash equivalents, deposits and accrued investment income where the credit risk is considered to be low by nature. There are no material expected credit losses recognised on these assets. At 31 December 2023, $9 million (31 December 2022: $7 million) are past their due date and as recovery is anticipated, immaterial expected credit loss provision has been established.\n\nIn addition, the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security in both years.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to exchange gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities held by the Group's business units in a currency other than the functional currency of the relevant business units or the currency to which the functional currency is pegged (eg financial assets and liabilities of USD denominated business in Hong Kong). The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts and currency swaps as described in note (b) below.\n\nThe amount of exchange loss on financial instruments recognised in the income statement in 2023, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at FVTPL, is $(38) million (2022: $234 million gain).",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## (b) Derivatives and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.\n\nThe Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IFRS 9/IAS 39. The Group has no net investment, fair value or cash flow hedges under IFRS 9 and IAS 39 at 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively. All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value, with movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Derivatives held and their purpose\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward contracts, swaps and swaptions.\n\nAll over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc) master agreements and collateral agreements are in place between the individual entities and relevant counterparties under each of these market master agreements. The collateral management for these transactions is conducted under the usual and customary terms and conditions set out in the Credit Support Annex to the ISDA master agreement.\n\nDerivatives are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Group's investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks. The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.\n\n## (c) Derecognition, collateral and offsetting\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe Group is party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell the securities. The securities are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position but the right to receive the cash paid is recognised as deposits.\n\nThe Group has entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities. At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions, which is represented by the purchased securities was $3,623 million (31 December 2022: $3,244 million).\n\n## Securities lending and repurchase agreements\n\nThe Group is also party to various securities lending agreements (including repurchase agreements) under which securities are loaned to third parties on a short-term basis. The loaned securities are not derecognised; rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification. To the extent cash collateral is received it is recognised on the statement of financial position with the obligation to repay the cash paid recognised as a liability. Other collateral is not recognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had $2,001 million (31 December 2022: $1,571 million) of lent securities and assets subject to repurchase agreements. The cash and securities collateral held or pledged under such agreements were $2,042 million (31 December 2022: $1,679 million).\n\n## Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had pledged $457 million (31 December 2022: $62 million) for liabilities and held collateral of $1,586 million (31 December 2022: $234 million) for assets in respect of derivative transactions. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.\n\nThe Group has entered into collateral arrangements in relation to derivative transactions, which permit sale or re-pledging of underlying collateral. The Group has not sold any non-cash collateral held or re-pledged any non-cash collateral.\n\n## Offsetting assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The Group recognises amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.",

Any assets or liabilities recognised for cash flows arising before the recognition of the related group of contracts (including any assets for insurance acquisition cash flows) are included in the carrying amount of the related portfolios of contracts.\n\nThe amounts recorded in the balance sheet as insurance and reinsurance contract asset and liabilities are set out in the table below (on the left hand side), broken out into their component parts. Additionally presented on the right hand side are the same amounts but including the Group's share of the relevant amounts of its joint venture and associates, which are equity accounted for on the statement of financial position and hence all assets and liabilities of those businesses are included in a separate line.\n\nManagement believe that the movement in the CSM is a key driver for understanding changes in profitability from period to period and as the Group's share of the results of the joint ventures and associates are included in the Group's adjusted operating and total profit, it is relevant to understand the movement in insurance assets and liabilities including those entities too.\n\n## Therefore note C3 comprises:\n\n- - Note C3.1 which sets out the components of assets and liabilities as described above. It also provides adjusted shareholders' equity which includes the Contractual service margin net of tax and other adjustments, which management believes is a better measure of value than IFRS shareholders' equity alone as it includes the Group's future expected profits (based on assumptions at 31 December) on policies that are inforce at the balance sheet date.\n- - Note C3.2 which contains the required IFRS 17 disclosures on how certain insurance and reinsurance contract balances have moved during the year, including an analysis of the movement of CSM by transition type. These exclude JV and associate balances.\n- - Note C3.3 includes the disclosures in C3.2 which management believe would be helpful to show on a basis that includes the Group's share of joint ventures and associates, together with a further breakdown of the movement in insurance and reinsurance contract balances by segment. The difference in most cases between the notes in C3.2 and C3.3 is solely the addition of the joint venture and associate amounts and so no explicit reconciliation has been provided to bridge between the two.",

The surrender value, net of policy loans (where these exist), is accounted as the investment component of a contract. Participating and non-participating (such as whole-life and endowment) contracts have explicit surrender values. There are a relatively small number of products that do not have a surrender value, and the investment components of these contracts are determined on a case-by-case basis. The non-distinct investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group is required to separate  the following components and account for them as if they were stand-alone contracts.\n\n- - Distinct investment components. An investment component is distinct if and only if (a) the insurance and investment components are not highly interrelated and (b) a contract with equivalent terms is, or could be, sold separately in the same market or jurisdiction.\n- - Embedded derivatives that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract and whose economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.\n- - Distinct services other than insurance contract services. A service component is distinct if it is not highly interrelated with the insurance component and the entity provides no significant service in integrating the service component with the insurance component\n\nThere are no material instances within the Group where distinct investment components, distinct services or embedded derivatives are separated from insurance contracts.\n\nAsset management services for investments held under an insurance contract are not separated.\n\n## Subsequent measurement of CSM\n\nThe CSM of each group of contracts is calculated at each reporting date as follows.\n\nThe carrying amount of the CSM of contracts measured under the GMM at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the year, adjusted for: (a) the CSM of any new contracts that are added to the group in the year; (b) interest accreted at locked-in discount rate; (c) changes in fulfilment cash flows arising from operating assumption changes and variances that relate to future services except for those relating to onerous contracts; (d) the effect of currency exchange differences on the CSM; and (e) the amount of CSM recognised in profit or loss in the year based on the coverage units.\n\nThe carrying amount of the CSM of contracts measured under the VFA at each reporting date is the carrying amount at the start of the year, adjusted for: (a) the CSM of any new contracts that are added to the group in the year; (b) the change in the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items; (c) changes in fulfilment cash flows arising from both operating and economic assumption changes and variances that relate to future services except for those relating to onerous contracts; (d) the effect of currency exchange differences on the CSM; and (e) the amount of CSM recognised in profit or loss in the year based on the coverage units.\n\nThe table below provides a description of the material features of each of the key products written by the Group, together with the measurement model used to determine their contract liabilities under IFRS 17.",

Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group from its liability to its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements largely for the purpose of managing its loss exposure. The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies. 98 per cent (31 December 2022: 95 per cent) of the Group's reinsurance contract BEL that are assets, excluding the Group's share of the balances held by life joint ventures and associates, are held with reinsurers with a rating of A- and above by Standard & Poor's or other external rating agencies by reference to the reinsurance BEL.\n\nThe reinsurance contracts held primarily relate to protection business written in Hong Kong. The Group's Hong Kong business cedes insurance risk to limit exposure to underwriting losses under various agreements that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, on a coinsurance, surplus, quota share, or catastrophe excess of loss basis. The amount of each risk retained depends on the evaluation of the specific risk, subject to certain circumstances, to internally set maximum limits based on characteristics of coverage.\n\nAs required by IFRS 17, all reinsurance contracts held by the Group are measured using the GMM.\n\nA group of reinsurance contracts held is recognised on the following date:\n\n- - Reinsurance contracts held by the Group that provide proportionate coverage: The later of the start date of the coverage period, and the date on which any underlying insurance contract is initially recognised. This applies to the Group's quota share reinsurance contracts.\n- - Other (non-proportionate) reinsurance contracts held by the Group: The earlier of beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts or the recognition date of an underlying onerous group of insurance contracts issued.\n- - Reinsurance contracts held acquired via a business acquisition/ combination: The date of the business acquisition/combination.\n\nOn initial recognition, the CSM of a group of reinsurance contracts held represents a net cost or net gain on purchasing reinsurance. It is measured as the equal and opposite amount of the total of (a) the fulfilment cash flows, (b) any amount arising from the derecognition of any assets or liabilities previously recognised for cash flows related to the group, (c) any cash flows arising at that date and (d) any income recognised in profit or loss because of onerous underlying contracts recognised at that date. However, if the net cost of purchasing reinsurance relates to past events, the Group recognises the net cost immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe carrying amount at the end of each reporting period of a group of reinsurance contracts held is measured in the same way as the underlying insurance contracts under GMM. Reinsurance contracts held are subject to the same modification requirements as insurance contracts.\n\n## C4 Intangible assets\n\n## C4.1 Goodwill\n\n## Business combination\n\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. The Group chooses the full goodwill method or the partial goodwill method to calculate goodwill on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred and not included in goodwill. Income and expenses of acquired businesses are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.\n\nWhere the Group writes a put option, which if exercised triggers the purchase of non-controlling interests as part of its business acquisition, the put option is recognised as a financial liability at the acquisition date. Where risks and rewards remain with the non-controlling interests, a corresponding amount is deducted from equity. Any subsequent changes to the carrying amount of the put option liability are also recognised within equity.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalised and carried on the Group consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired.\n\nGoodwill shown on the consolidated statement of financial position represents amounts allocated to businesses in Asia and Africa in respect of both acquired asset management and life businesses. There has been no impairment as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.\n\n|                          |   2023 $m | 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Carrying value at 1 Jan  |       890 | 907       |\n| Exchange differences     |         6 | (17)      |\n| Carrying value at 31 Dec |       896 | 890       |",

        "page_content": "## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing. These CGUs are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Of the carrying value at 31 December 2023, $449 million (31 December 2022: $445 million) relates to asset management business in Thailand and $238 million (31 December 2022: $234 million) relates to the acquisition of UOB Life in Singapore. Other goodwill amounts are allocated across CGUs, which are not individually material.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the CGU's carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount. The Group's methodology of assessing whether goodwill may be impaired for acquired life and asset management operations is discussed below.\n\nFor acquired life businesses, the Group routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of the acquired life business with the value of the current in-force business as determined using the EEV methodology. Any excess of IFRS value over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired. The methodology and assumptions underpinning the Group's EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.\n\nThe goodwill in respect of asset management businesses comprises mainly the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Thanachart Fund Management Co., Ltd in 2019 and TMB Asset Management Co., Ltd in Thailand in 2018. The two acquired entities were merged as Eastspring Asset Management (Thailand) Co., Ltd in 2022. The goodwill impairment testing for these businesses is prepared as a single CGU reflecting that these businesses are managed together. The recoverable amount has been determined by calculating the value in use of the combined business calculated using a discounted cash flow valuation.\n\nFor the combined Thailand asset management business, the valuation is based on a number of key assumptions as follows:\n\n- - Cash flow projections based on the latest five-year business plan or forecast;\n- - A constant growth rate of 3.5 per cent (2022: 3.5 per cent) on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the cash flow projection period;\n- - The risk discount rate applied in accordance with the nature of the businesses. The pre-tax discount rate applied is 9.0 per cent (31 December 2022: 9.0 per cent); and\n- - The continuation of asset management contracts on similar terms.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the impairment testing, including the cash flow projections, are subject to fluctuations in the external market and economic conditions. No material impairment is expected to occur if a reasonably possible change is made to each of the individual key assumptions, which the Group has taken to be a 10 per cent fall in cashflow projections, a 1 per cent fall in the growth rate or a 1 per cent increase in the discount rate. A more significant fall or a combination of effects could have a larger impact on the recoverable value and so there are circumstances where an impairment could occur.\n\n## C4.2 Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired on the purchase of a subsidiary or portfolio of contracts are measured at fair value on acquisition. Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire or cost to develop them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. For intangibles other than goodwill, amortisation follows the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, a straight-line method is applied. For software, the amortisation generally represents the licence period of the software acquired. Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the Consolidated income statement and allocated between attributable and non-attributable expenses for the Group's insurance entities as shown in note B2. Impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.\n\n|                                          | 2023 $m                      | 2023 $m                      | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m                      | 2022 $m                     | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|\n|                                          | Distribution rights note (i) | Other  intangibles note (ii) | Total     | Distribution rights note (i) | Other intangibles note (ii) | Total     |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                         |                              |                              |           |                              |                             |           |\n| Cost                                     | 5,176                        | 489                          | 5,665     | 5,037                        | 425                         | 5,462     |\n| Accumulated amortisation                 | (1,546)                      | (235)                        | (1,781)   | (1,255)                      | (192)                       | (1,447)   |\n|                                          | 3,630                        | 254                          | 3,884     | 3,782                        | 233                         | 4,015     |\n| Additions                                | 415                          | 83                           | 498       | 206                          | 83                          | 289       |\n| Amortisation charge                      | (330)                        | (49)                         | (379)     | (301)                        | (48)                        | (349)     |\n| Disposals and transfers                  | -                            | (6)                          | (6)       | -                            | (6)                         | (6)       |\n| Exchange differences and other movements | (6)                          | (5)                          | (11)      | (57)                         | (8)                         | (65)      |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                        | 3,709                        | 277                          | 3,986     | 3,630                        | 254                         | 3,884     |\n| Comprising:                              |                              |                              |           |                              |                             |           |\n| Cost                                     | 5,585                        | 537                          | 6,122     | 5,176                        | 489                         | 5,665     |\n| Accumulated amortisation                 | (1,876)                      | (260)                        | (2,136)   | (1,546)                      | (235)                       | (1,781)   |\n\n## Notes",

The market and insurance risks and also sustainability-related risks, including how they affect Group's operations and how these are managed are discussed in the Risk review report referred to above. The sustainability-related risks discussed in the Risk review report include in particular the potential long-term impact of environmental risks associated with climate change (including physical and transition risks) on the Group's investments and liabilities.\n\nThe Sustainability Report included in this Annual Report sets out three commonly used scenarios of plausible global responses to climate change. The Group's scenario testing results are translated into sensitivities to economic factors to assess the possible financial consequences of climate change on the Group's business. Though the Group faces potential financial risks from plausible global responses to climate change, the results for the Group's scenario testing are not outside observed market volatility suggesting no immediate need for explicit climate change allowance within the current valuations of the Group's investment portfolio. The Group remains mindful of the limitations within the results of the scenario testing and that the models for the testing continue to change. Additionally, the Group's climate scenario analysis currently does not consider management actions the Group could take to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. In addition, given the current insufficiency and uncertainty of data available, at this stage, the Group's claims and lapses assumptions for its life and health insurance business do not include additional assumptions related to the impacts of climate change over and above those that arise from the annual review of experience. The Group will continue to perform its regular experience analysis, engage with reinsurers and monitor relevant academic studies. If significant changes occur, the financial impacts from climate-related risks on insurance liabilities will be considered. The Group has analysed the distribution of its customers across locations to assess their vulnerability to extreme climate events to improve the Group's understanding of its customers and its exposure to climate risks.\n\nSensitivity analyses of IFRS profit or loss, shareholders' equity and CSM to key market and other risks for the insurance operations are provided in section C6.1 below. The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on profit after tax, shareholders' equity and CSM to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are considered to be reasonably possible at the relevant balance sheet date. The sensitivities reflect consequential impacts from market movements at the valuation date.\n\nThe sensitivity of the Group's Eastspring and central operations to market risks is discussed in section C6.2.\n\nThe Group benefits from diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Group's operations and, within those operations, through a broad mix of product types. The simplified sensitivities below are calculated at the individual business unit level and aggregated to show the Group impact and no group level adjustments are made.\n\n## Relevant correlation factors include:\n\n- - Correlation across geographic regions for both financial and non-financial risk factors; and\n- - Correlation across risk factors for mortality and morbidity, expenses, persistency and other risks.\n\nThe geographical diversity of the Group's business means that it has some exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations where a group undertaking has a functional currency that differs to US dollar, the Group's presentational currency. Consistent with the Group's accounting policies, the profits of these business units are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders' equity at the closing rate for the reporting period. For 2023 and 2022, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note A1. The Group has no exposure to currency fluctuation from business units that operate in USD, or currencies pegged to the USD (such as HKD), and reduced exposure to currencies partially managed to the USD within a basket of currencies (such as SGD). The impact of changes of foreign exchange rates on the Group's assets and liabilities from the above exposure is recorded as part of Other comprehensive income and in 2023 represented a loss of $124 million (2022: loss of $603 million) which corresponds to 1 per cent of opening shareholders' equity (2022: 3 per cent). Additionally note B1.1 'Segment Results' shows the Group's segment and total profit for 2022 as if it had been prepared using the same exchange rates as 2023, giving an indication of how foreign exchange rates impact the Group's profit and loss.\n\nA 10 per cent increase (strengthening of the US dollar) or decrease (weakening of the US dollar) in these rates would have reduced or increased profit for the year and shareholders' equity of the Group respectively as follows:\n\n|                                              | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Change in local currency to $ exchange rates | Decrease of 10%  | Increase of 10%  | Decrease of 10%  | Increase of 10%  |\n| Profit after tax for the year                | 152              | (124)            | 49               | (40)             |\n| Shareholders' equity                         | 1,256            | (1,028)          | 1,182            | (967)            |\n\nThe Group is also exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities held by the Group's undertakings in a currency other than their functional currency. These will often be managed by derivatives or by having assets and liabilities that match in terms of currency.",

The equity risk sensitivity analysis assumes that all equity indices fall by the same percentage.\n\nThe sensitivities below only allow for limited management actions such as changes to policyholder bonuses and re-pricing for medical business, where applicable. If the economic conditions set out in the sensitivities persisted, the financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts shown below. Given the continuous risk management processes in place, management could take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses, including (but not limited to) increased use of reinsurance, repricing of in-force benefits, changes to new business pricing and the mix of new business being sold.\n\nThe impact of changes in interest rates and equity values impacts both assets and liabilities. For assets backing insurance contract liabilities and those related liabilities, these impacts will vary depending on whether insurance contracts are classified as VFA or GMM. In addition there will be impacts from other shareholder assets that back IFRS shareholders equity rather than insurance contract liabilities. The vast majority of the Group's investments are classified as FVTPL and so movements as a result of interest rate and equity markets directly impact profit, unless they are offset by corresponding movements in the Group's liabilities.\n\nFor VFA contracts (which include the majority of the Group's participating and unit-linked contracts but not all as discussed in note A2.1) movements in underlying assets are matched by a movement in insurance liabilities. Changes in BEL and risk adjustment as a result of a change in discount rate or from changes in the variable fee (that is dependent on the value of underlying assets) are taken as a change to the CSM with no immediate impact on profit or shareholders' equity. There will however be an impact on profit and shareholders' equity from changes to the CSM amortisation as a result of changes both to the CSM and the discounting of the coverage units. Onerous contracts with no CSM will also have impacts going directly to the income statement.\n\nFor GMM contracts, the CSM is calculated on a locked-in basis (ie using discount rates applied at the dates of initial recognition of each group of contracts), whereas the BEL and risk adjustment are calculated using a current discount rate. This accounting mismatch passes through the income statement. The impact will depend on whether the BEL is an asset or a liability. For BEL assets, which are largely offset by CSM liabilities, (ie for certain protection contracts where future premiums are expected to exceed future claims and expenses) increases in interest rates will reduce the BEL asset with no impact on the CSM liability and hence reduce profit. For a BEL liability, where the BEL and CSM liabilities are backed by invested assets, (eg certain Universal Life contracts) there are likely to be offsetting asset impacts (for example BEL liabilities and bond values will both reduce as interest rates increase) and the impact on profit will be dependent on any mismatches between assets and liabilities together with the impact of the CSM being calculated on a locked-in basis.\n\nFor other shareholder assets, that are not backing insurance contract liabilities increases in interest rates and falls in equity markets reduce asset values, which under the Group's accounting policy pass directly through the income statement and hence reduce profit (vice-versa for decreases in interest rates and increases in equity markets).\n\nThe income statement volatilities stated above lead to a volatility in the shareholders' equity to the same extent.\n\n| Base values                                                  | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Profit (loss) after tax for the year from insurance segments | 2,099     | (494)     |\n| Group shareholders' equity as at 31 Dec                      | 17,823    | 16,731    |\n| CSM as at 31 Dec including JVs and associates                | 21,012    | 19,989    |\n\n| Insurance segments                                                | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest rates and consequential effects                          | Decrease of 0.5% | Increase of 1%   | Decrease of 0.5% | Increase of 1%   |\n| Increase/(decrease) to shareholders' equity and profit after tax: |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Financial assets                                                  | 6,815            | (12,004)         | 5,873            | (10,362)         |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities (including CSM)                | (7,332)          | 12,191           | (6,120)          | 10,295           |\n| Net effect on shareholders' equity and profit after tax  note     | (328)            | 24               | (127)            | (165)            |\n| Increase/(decrease) to CSM liability:                             |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| CSM                                                               | 358              | (880)            | 220              | (850)            |",

Changes to the results of the Africa insurance operations from interest rate or equity price changes would not materially impact the Group's results.\n\nThe Group uses the segment measure 'Adjusted operating profit' to review the performance of the business (see note B1.2 for how this measure is determined). The impact on 'Adjusted operating profit' will be more muted than on total profit as long-term asset returns are assumed for surplus assets and long-term spreads are assumed for GMM business. Adjusted operating profit will be impacted by changes in CSM amortisation for VFA business following the impact of economic changes on underlying assets and discount rates that impact the value of variable fees, and on the value of onerous contracts losses (or reversal thereof) taken directly to the income statement. The changes in CSM amortisation result from changes both to the CSM and the discounting of the coverage units.\n\nThe pre-tax adjusted operating profit impacts for a decrease of 0.5 per cent and an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates at 31 December 2023 were $(30) million and $33 million, respectively (2022: $(47) million and $54 million, respectively).\n\nThe pre-tax adjusted operating profit impacts for a decrease of 20 per cent and an increase of 10 per cent in equity/property market values at 31 December 2023 were $(186) million and $83 million, respectively (2022: $(157) million and $66 million, respectively).\n\n## (b) Sensitivity to insurance risk\n\nFor insurance operations, adverse persistency experience can impact the overall IFRS profitability of certain types of business written. This risk is managed at a business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary. These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection, as well as other customer retention efforts. The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features. The effects of these management actions have not been factored into the sensitivities below.\n\nIn addition many of the business units are exposed to mortality and morbidity risk and changes in maintenance expense level.\n\nChanges to the assumed levels of persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses from that when the contract is first recognised will impact the overall profitability of the insurance contract. These risks are managed on a portfolio basis and reinsurance can be used to mitigate the risk the Group has. In particular for certain medical contracts, product repricing is a key management action that is embedded in the process to mitigate morbidity risk. A degree of medical product repricing is assumed to have been undertaken in the mortality and morbidity sensitivity results shown in the table below.\n\nIn terms of the impact on the Group's financial results, changes to shareholders' equity or profit or loss will occur over the life of the contract, as changes to future cash flows from altered assumptions are recognised as an increase or decrease of CSM (except for onerous contracts), which is then amortised to profit and loss (and hence shareholders' equity) over time.\n\nThe table below shows how the shareholders' equity and CSM would have increased or decreased if changes in the future assumptions in insurance risk that were reasonably possible at the reporting date had occurred. This analysis presents the sensitivities both before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that the other variables remain constant.\n\n|                                       | 2023 $m                                                  | 2023 $m                                                  | 2023 $m               | 2023 $m             |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|                                       | Net effect on shareholders' equity  and profit after tax | Net effect on shareholders' equity  and profit after tax | Net effect on CSM     | Net effect on CSM   |\n| Sensitivity to insurance risk:        | Gross of  reinsurance                                    | Net of  reinsurance                                      | Gross of  reinsurance | Net of  reinsurance |\n| Maintenance expenses - 10% increase   | (77)                                                     | (71)                                                     | (420)                 | (427)               |\n| Lapse rates - 10% increase            | (88)                                                     | (76)                                                     | (1,363)               | (1,496)             |\n| Mortality and morbidity - 5% increase | (131)                                                    | (96)                                                     | (638)                 | (261)               |",

The effect from a 5 per cent decrease in mortality and morbidity assumptions is dependent on the degree of product repricing assumed to have been undertaken.\n\n## C6.2 Eastspring and central operations\n\nThe profit for the year of Eastspring is sensitive to the level of assets under management, as this significantly affects the value of management fees earned by the business in the current and future periods. Assets under management will rise and fall as market conditions change, with a consequential impact on profitability.\n\nEastspring holds a small amount of investments direct on its balance sheet, including investments in respect of seeding capital into retail funds it sells to third parties (see note C1). Eastspring's profit will therefore have some exposure to the market movements of these investments.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 Central operations did not hold significant financial investments other than short-term deposits and money market funds held by the Group's treasury function for liquidity purposes and so there is immaterial sensitivity to market movements.",

Pillar Two Model Rules' referred to in note A2.2.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, a deferred tax asset of $54 million has been recognised in relation to unused UK tax losses and deductible temporary differences, due to an increase in forecast taxable profit in the UK tax group, which follows the change of tax residence of Prudential plc in March 2023 from the UK to Hong Kong. The Group has further unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences of $1,319 million (31 December 2022: $2,235 million) in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. $837 million of unused tax losses expired at the point of Prudential plc's tax residency change. Of the unrecognised amounts, $108 million (31 December 2022: $103 million) relates to unused tax losses that will expire within the next ten years (potential tax benefit: $24 million), and the remainder of $1,211 million (31 December 2022: $1,295 million) has no expiry date (potential tax benefit: $240 million).\n\nSome of the Group's businesses are located in jurisdictions in which a withholding tax charge is incurred upon the distribution of earnings. At 31 December 2023, deferred tax liabilities of $225 million (31 December 2022: $210 million) have not been recognised in respect of such withholding taxes as the Group is able to control the timing of the distributions and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

        "page_content": "## C9 Capital\n\n## C9.1 Group objectives, policies and processes for managing capital\n\n## Capital measure\n\nThe Group manages its Group GWS capital resources as its measure of capital. At 31 December 2023, estimated Group shareholder GWS capital resources is $24.3 billion (31 December 2022: $23.2 billion).\n\n## External capital requirements\n\nPrudential plc is subject to the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework issued by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA).\n\nPrudential applies the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules set out in the GWS Framework to determine group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels). The summation of local statutory capital requirements across the Group is used to determine group regulatory capital requirements, with no allowance for diversification between business operations. The GWS eligible group capital resources are determined by the summation of capital resources across local solvency regimes for regulated entities and IFRS shareholders' equity, with adjustments where applicable, for non-regulated entities.\n\nMore details on Group capital are given in section I(i) in the Additional unaudited financial information section.\n\n## Meeting of capital management objectives\n\nThe GWS group capital adequacy requirements have been met since the GWS Framework became effective for Prudential upon designation. This includes maintaining total eligible group capital resources in excess of the Group Prescribed Capital Requirement (GPCR) of the supervised group and maintaining Tier 1 group capital resources in excess of the Group Minimum Capital Requirement (GMCR) of the supervised group.\n\nThe Group's capital management framework focuses on achieving sustainable, profitable growth and maintaining a resilient balance sheet, with a disciplined approach to active capital allocation.\n\nAs well as holding sufficient capital to meet GWS requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its central holding companies so that it can:\n\n- - Invest in core capabilities;\n- - Maintain flexibility and absorb shock events;\n- - Cover central costs;\n- - Fund dividends; and\n- - Fund new opportunities where there is a good strategic fit.\n\nMore details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in section I(iv) in the Additional unaudited financial information section.\n\nThe Group monitors regulatory capital, economic capital and rating agency capital metrics and manages the business within its risk appetite by remaining within its economic and regulatory capital limits. Reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the local regulators.\n\nThe sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset/liability management.\n\n## C9.2 Local capital regulations\n\n## (a) Insurance operations\n\nFor regulated insurance entities, the capital resources and required capital included in the GWS capital measure for Hong Kong IA Group regulatory purposes are based on the local solvency regime applicable in each jurisdiction. The local valuation basis for the assets, liabilities and capital requirements of significant insurance operations are set out below.\n\n## CPL\n\nA risk-based capital, risk management and governance framework, known as the China Risk Oriented Solvency System (C-ROSS), applies in the Chinese Mainland.\n\nUnder C-ROSS, insurers are required to maintain a core solvency ratio (core capital over minimum capital) and a comprehensive solvency ratio (capital resources over minimum capital) of not lower than 50 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe actual capital is the difference between the admitted assets and admitted liabilities with trading and AFS assets marked-to-market and other assets at book value. Policyholder liabilities are based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a separate risk margin.\n\nThe final regulations of C-ROSS Phase II became effective in the first quarter of 2022. The main updates to the local regulation were to introduce explicit tiering and admissibility rules on negative reserves in the capital resources and further updates to the risk calibrations used in calculating capital requirements. A transition period allows insurers to implement the rules in stages before full implementation of the new regime is required from 2025 onwards.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nPrudential Hong Kong Limited applies the new risk-based capital regime (HK RBC) following approval in April 2022 from the Hong Kong IA to early adopt this new regime. The HK RBC framework requires liabilities to be based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions and capital requirements to be risk-based, resulting in the release of prudent regulatory margins previously included in liabilities and an increase in required capital. The HK RBC regime is expected to become effective across the industry in the second half of 2024. The Hong Kong IA issued a consultation paper on the draft rules in December 2023 and Prudential Hong Kong Limited have provided feedback on this. The quantitative impact of any changes to the final rules will be reflected on implementation of the final HK RBC regime.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nSolvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach. The capital resources are based on assets that are marked-to-market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. Liabilities are zeroised at policy level (i.e. negative liabilities are not permitted at a policy level). For unit-linked policies, an unearned premium reserve is established.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nA risk-based capital (RBC) framework applies in Malaysia. The local regulator, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent, below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken. Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.\n\nThe capital resources are based on assets that are marked to market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. Liabilities are zeroised at a fund level (i.e. negative liabilities are not permitted at fund level). The BNM has initiated a review of its RBC framework for insurers and Takaful operators in 2021 and the BNM has yet to issue their final technical specifications. The exact timing of implementation of potential revisions remains uncertain as these would need to be subject to quantitative impact studies and parallel run prior to implementation.\n\nMarket liberalisation measures were introduced by BNM in April 2009, which increases the limit from 49 per cent to 70 per cent on foreign equity ownership for insurance companies and Takaful operators in Malaysia. A higher foreign equity limit beyond 70 per cent for insurance companies will be considered by BNM on a case-by-case basis, for example, for companies who financially support expansion of providing insurance coverage to the most vulnerable in Malaysian society through the National B40 Protection Trust Fund.\n\n## Singapore\n\nA risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore. The local regulator, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has the authority to direct insurance companies to satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act, if considered appropriate. The capital resources are based on assets that are marked to market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. The updated risk-based capital framework (RBC2) permits the recognition of a prudent allowance for negative reserves in the capital resources.\n\n## (b) Asset management operations - regulatory and other surplus\n\nCertain asset management subsidiaries of the Group are subject to local regulatory requirements. The movement in the year of the estimated surplus regulatory capital position (over the GPCR) of those subsidiaries, combined with the movement in the IFRS basis shareholders' equity for unregulated asset management operations, is as follows:\n\n|                                          | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Balance at 1 Jan                         | 466       | 522       |\n| Gains during the year                    | 254       | 187       |\n| Movement in capital requirement          | (20)      | 15        |\n| Capital injection                        | 3         | 3         |\n| Distributions made to the parent company | (205)     | (214)     |\n| Exchange and other movements             | (1)       | (47)      |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                        | 497       | 466       |\n\n## C9.3 Transferability of capital resources\n\nThe amounts retained within the insurance companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum capital requirements. The businesses may, in general, remit dividends to parent entities, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency requirements and there are sufficient statutory accounting profits. For with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained within the funds, with distribution to shareholders tied to the shareholders' share of declared bonuses.\n\nCapital resources of the non-insurance business units are transferable after taking account an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency requirements, where relevant.",

Upon the adoption of IFRS 17, the Group has elected to measure the owner-occupied properties held by the participating funds of its Singapore business at fair value from the transition date. Previously, these properties were measured at cost less accumulated depreciation less any impairment losses. The fair value of these properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Group's qualified surveyors.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group does not have any right-of-use assets that would meet the definition of investment property. As at 31 December 2023, total right-of-use assets comprised $202 million (31 December 2022: $267 million) of property and $14 million (31 December 2022: $4 million) of non-property assets.\n\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option. This assertion is revisited if there is a material change in circumstances. As at 31 December 2023, the undiscounted value of lease payments beyond the break period not recognised in the lease liabilities is $231 million (31 December 2022: $189 million).\n\nThe Group has non-cancellable property subleases which have been classified as operating leases under IFRS 16. The sublease rental income received in 2023 for the leases is $7 million (2022: $6 million).\n\n## Capital expenditure: property, plant and equipment by segment\n\nThe capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment excluding right-of-use assets in 2023 of $44 million (2022: $34 million) arose as follows:\n\n|                                                            | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hong Kong                                                  | 22        | 11        |\n| Indonesia                                                  | -         | 1         |\n| Malaysia                                                   | 1         | 1         |\n| Singapore                                                  | 2         | 3         |\n| Growth markets and other                                   | 15        | 16        |\n| Eastspring                                                 | 4         | 2         |\n| Total segment                                              | 44        | 34        |\n| Unallocated to a segment (central operations)              | -         | -         |\n| Total capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment | 44        | 34        |",

While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group believes that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nLitigation developments during the year include a case regarding a historic transaction connected to the legal and beneficial ownership of 49 per cent of the ordinary shares of the holding company of Prudential Assurance Malaysia Berhad. Prudential currently owns 51 per cent of this entity but consolidates the entity at 100 per cent reflecting the economic interest of the Group. Prudential has been successful at court hearings relating to the transaction concerned both in the first instance and at the subsequent appeal stage. In July 2023, the Federal Court, which is Malaysia's highest Court, granted leave to allow the appellant to further appeal the case in the Federal Court. The appeals process is ongoing.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Group has provided guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has guaranteed public debt securities issued by one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Prudential Funding (Asia) PLC from early 2023. The Group considers the likelihood of outflows arising under such guarantees and commitments as remote.\n\n## Intra-group capital support arrangements\n\nPrudential has provided undertakings to the regulators of its Hong Kong life subsidiary, Prudential Hong Kong Limited, to formalise the circumstances regarding their solvency levels in which intra-group capital support will be provided by Prudential. Other intra-group transactions are discussed in note D3 below.\n\n## D2 Post balance sheet events\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe 2023 second interim dividend approved by the Board of Directors after 31 December 2023 is as described in note B5.\n\n## Share repurchase programme to neutralise 2023 employee and agent share scheme issuance\n\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced that the share repurchase programme in respect of 3,851,376 ordinary shares that it announced on 5 January 2024 and commenced on 8 January has been completed. The purpose of the share repurchase programme was to offset dilution from the vesting of awards under employee and agent share schemes during 2023. The Company has repurchased 3,851,376 ordinary shares in aggregate (representing 0.14 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the year (as disclosed in note C8)) at a volume weighted average price of \u00a38.2676 per ordinary share for a total consideration of approximately \u00a332 million.",

Intra-group transactions of the Group mainly related to a limited number of loans, guarantees or services provided by the Company to or from others business units, or between business units, including investment management services provided by the Group's asset managers to the insurance operations businesses as shown in note B1.4. All intra-group transactions are subject to the same internal approval framework as external transactions. Given the nature of the Group's business there has historically been limited interconnectedness across the Group. The Group reviews its recovery plan (that also covers intra-group transactions and the level of the Group's interconnectivity risk) on an annual basis and details the remedial actions that could be used to restore financial strength and viability if the Group were to come under severe stress.\n\nThe Company has transactions and outstanding balances with collective investment schemes and similar entities that are not consolidated and where a Group company acts as manager, which are regarded as related parties for the purposes of IAS 24. The balances are included in the Group's statement of financial position at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IFRS 9 / IAS 39 classifications with the corresponding amounts included in the income statement. The transactions include amounts paid on issue of shares or units, amounts received on cancellation of shares or units and amounts paid in respect of the periodic charge and administration fee.\n\nIn addition, there are no material transactions between the Group's joint ventures and associates, which are accounted for on an equity method basis, and other Group companies except for a planned capital injection into CPL, the Group's joint venture business in the Chinese Mainland announced in December 2023. The Group announced that it was providing additional growth capital to CPL of RMB1.25 billion (US$176 million) in cash subject to relevant regulatory approvals, with CITIC, its joint venture partner providing an equal amount. In anticipation of the future capital injection, the Group advanced the cash of $176 million to CPL in December 2023.\n\nKey management personnel of the Company, as described in note B2.3, may from time to time purchase insurance or asset management products marketed by Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, transactions with key management personnel were not deemed to be significant both by virtue of their size and in the context of the individuals' financial positions. All of these transactions were on terms broadly equivalent to those that prevailed in arm's-length transactions.\n\nAdditional details on the Directors' interests in shares, transactions or arrangements are given in the Directors' remuneration report. Key management remuneration is disclosed in note B2.3.\n\n## D4 Commitments\n\nThe Group has provided, from time to time, certain commitments to third parties.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had $2,456 million unfunded commitments (31 December 2022: $2,626 million) primarily related to investments in infrastructure funds and alternative investment funds in Asia.",

        "page_content": "## D5 Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates\n\n## D5.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control. The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met:\n\n- - It has power over an investee;\n- - It is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- - It has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.\n\n## (a) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are those investees that the Group controls. The majority of the Group's subsidiaries are corporate entities.\n\nThe Group performs a re-assessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and an investee. Where the Group is deemed to control an entity, it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated. Where the Group holds a minority share in an entity with no control over the entity, the investments are carried at fair value within financial investments in the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nEntities consolidated by the Group include Qualifying Partnerships as defined under the UK Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 (the 'Partnerships Act'). The Group's limited partnership has taken advantage of the exemption under regulation 7 of the Partnerships Act from the financial statement requirements. This is under regulations 4 to 6 of the Partnership Act, on the basis that the limited partnership is consolidated in these financial statements.\n\n## (b) Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement. In a number of these arrangements, the Group's share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but does not control. Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of an entity.\n\nWith the exception of those referred to below, the Group accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates using the equity method of accounting. The Group's share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The equity method of accounting does not apply to investments in joint ventures and associates held by the Group's insurance or investment funds, including collective investment schemes which, as allowed by IAS 28 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', are carried at FVTPL.\n\n## (c) Structured entities\n\nStructured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. Voting rights relate to administrative tasks. Relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The Group invests in both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities including investment vehicles such as collective investment schemes, collateralised debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and similar asset-backed securities.\n\n## Collective investment schemes\n\nThe Group invests in collective investment schemes, that invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents and properties. In assessing control under IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', the Group determines whether it is acting as principal or agent and the variable returns from its involvement with these entities. The Group's percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors.\n\nWhere the entity is managed by a Group asset manager:\n\n- - Where the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50 per cent, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- - Where the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity; and\n- - Where the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 20 per cent, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.\n\nWhere the entity is managed by an asset manager outside the Group, an assessment is made of whether the Group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity and therefore control the entity. In assessing the Group's ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.\n\nWhere the Group is deemed to control an entity, it is treated as a subsidiary and is consolidated, with the interests of investors other than the Group being classified as liabilities, and presented within 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated investment funds'.\n\nWhere the Group does not control these entities (where the Group is deemed to be acting as an agent under IFRS 10) and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at FVTPL within financial investments in the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nWhere the Group's asset manager sets up investment funds as part of its asset management operations, unless the Group also participates in the ownership holding of the entities, the Group's interest is limited to the fees charged to manage the assets of such entities. With no participation in ownership holding of these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with investment funds. For these investment funds, the Group is not deemed to control the entities but deemed to be acting as an agent.",

When assessing control over the vehicles, the factors considered include the purpose and design of the vehicle, the Group's exposure to the variability of returns and the scope of the Group's ability to direct the relevant activities of the vehicle including any kick-out or removal rights that are held by third parties. The outcome of the control assessment is dependent on the terms and conditions of the respective individual arrangements.\n\nThe majority of such vehicles are not consolidated. In these cases, the Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles' activities. The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its holding and its exposure to the investments and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the vehicles in which it holds investments. Accordingly, the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are carried at FVTPL within financial investments in the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe table below provides aggregate carrying amounts of the investments in unconsolidated structured entities reported in the Group's Consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n|                                                                 | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2023 $m              | 31 Dec 2022 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Consolidated statement of financial position line items         | Investment funds | Other  structured  entities | Investment funds | Other  structured  entities |\n| Equity securities and holdings in collective investment schemes | 33,657           | -                           | 30,771           | -                           |\n| Debt securities                                                 | -                | 285                         | -                | 389                         |\n| Total investments in unconsolidated structured entities         | 33,657           | 285                         | 30,771           | 389                         |\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss related to the interest in unconsolidated structured entities is limited to the carrying value in the Consolidated statement of financial position and the unfunded investment commitments provided by the Group (see note D4).\n\nDuring the year, the Group receives dividend and interest income from its investments in these unconsolidated structured entities. Where the Group's asset manager manages these entities, such as the collective investment schemes, the Group also receives asset management fees from these entities.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group does not have an agreement, contractual or otherwise, or intention to provide financial support to structured entities (both consolidated and unconsolidated) that could expose the Group to a loss.\n\n## D5.2 Dividend restrictions and minimum capital requirements\n\nCertain Group entities are subject to restrictions on the amounts of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.\n\nUnder UK company law, UK companies can only declare dividends if they have sufficient distributable reserves.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves. Further details on local capital regulations in certain Asia operations are provided in note C9.2.\n\n## D5.3 Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures represent arrangements where the controlling parties through contractual or other agreement have the rights to the net assets of the arrangements. The Group has insurance and asset management joint ventures in Chinese Mainland with CITIC Group and an asset management joint venture in India with ICICI Bank. In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with Bank of China International Holdings Limited (BOCI) and Takaful insurance joint venture in Malaysia. For the Group's joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method, the net-of-tax results of these operations are included in the Group's profit before tax.\n\nThe Group's associates, which are also accounted for using the equity method, include the Indian insurance entity (with the majority shareholder being ICICI Bank).\n\nIn addition, the Group has investments in collective investment schemes, funds holding collateralised debt obligations and property funds where the Group has significant influence. As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for on a FVTPL basis. The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at FVTPL, where there are published price quotations, is approximately $0.5 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $0.3 billion).\n\nFor joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method, the 12 months financial information of these investments for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022 (covering the same period as that of the Group) has been used in these consolidated financial statements.",

Prudential plc provides life and health insurance and asset management services in Asia and Africa. Prudential's mission is to be the most trusted partner and protector for this generation and generations to come, by providing simple and accessible financial and health solutions.\n\n## 2   Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements of the Company, which comprise the statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity and related notes, are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101') and Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements in accordance with international accounting standards adopted for use in the UK but makes amendments where necessary, in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, and has set out below where advantages of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions have been taken. The Company has also taken the advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.\n\nIn these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- - A cash flow statement and related notes;\n- - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Group;\n- - Disclosure in respect of capital management; and\n- - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRS.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of the Group include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- - IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' in respect of Group-settled share-based payments;\n- - Disclosure required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 related to IFRS 9, and IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'; and\n- - IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' in respect of revenue recognition.\n\nThe accounting policies set out in note 3 below have been applied consistently to both years presented in these financial statements.\n\nThe Company and the Group manage cash resources, remittances and financing primarily in US dollars. Accordingly, the functional and presentational currency of the Company is US dollars.\n\nOn the basis of the assessment of going concern for the Company and the Group as set out in note A1 to the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## 3   Significant accounting policies\n\n## Investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less impairment. Investments are assessed for indicators of impairment, and if any are identified, any impairment is assessed by comparing the net assets and value in use of the subsidiary undertakings with the carrying value of the investments.\n\n## Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings\n\nAmounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less expected credit losses, which are determined using the expected credit loss approach under IFRS 9.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nUnder IFRS 9, except for derivative instruments (where applicable) that are mandatorily classified as FVTPL, all financial assets and liabilities of the Company are held at amortised cost. The Company assesses impairment on its loans and receivables using the expected credit loss approach. The expected credit loss on the Company's loans and receivables, the majority of which represent loans to its subsidiaries, have been assessed by taking into account the probability of defaults on those loans. In all cases, the subsidiaries are expected to have sufficient resources to repay the loans either now or over time based on projected earnings. For loans recallable on demand, the expected credit loss has been limited to the impact of discounting the value of the loan between the balance sheet date and the anticipated recovery date. For loans with a fixed maturity date the expected credit loss has been determined with reference to the historic experience of loans with equivalent credit characteristics.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity or, for subordinated debt, over the expected life of the instrument.",

        "page_content": "## Dividends\n\nInterim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions not denominated in the Company's functional currency, US dollars, are initially recorded at the rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the Company's functional currency are translated to the Company's functional currency at year end spot rates. The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.\n\n## Tax\n\nCurrent tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years. Current tax recoverable (payable) recognised in the balance sheet is measured at the amount expected to be either recovered from (paid to) relevant tax authorities or Group undertakings in relation to the surrender (claim) of tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 'Income Taxes'. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nThe Company has applied the mandatory exemption from recognising and disclosing information on the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2023 as required by the amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules' referred to in note A2.2 to the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn ('SAYE') plan for all UK and certain overseas employees. The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled.\n\nUnder IFRS 2 'Share-based payment', where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity. The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions. Cash receipts from business units in respect of newly issued share schemes are treated as returns of capital within investments in subsidiaries.\n\n## Significant accounting judgement - valuation of debt transfer\n\nThe fair value of the external debt transferred from the Company to Prudential Funding (Asia) plc in March 2023 was determined by reference to the externally observable prices of these quoted instruments.\n\nThe intercompany liability due to Prudential Funding (Asia) plc as consideration for the transfer of the external debt liabilities are for the same principal amounts and have identical terms to the external debt, with the exception of an additional margin on the interest rate. It is judged that the most appropriate measure of the fair value of these intercompany items is the fair value of the external debt instruments with an adjustment for the fair value of the additional interest margin, which increased the fair value of the liability by $17 million on initial recognition.",

In consideration for this transfer the Company entered into intercompany debt payable arrangements with Prudential Financial Partners (Asia) plc, which matched the terms and value of the external debt liability instruments, with an additional margin on the interest rate in excess of the interest payable on the debt liability instruments. These intercompany payable instruments were measured at fair value on initial recognition, which totalled $3,605 million, including accrued interest. The difference between the fair value of the intercompany payables and the previously recognised carrying value of the external debt instruments of $370 million was recognised as a gain in the Company's income statement. The fair value of these instruments was established by reference to the observable market value of the external debt liability instruments transferred on the same day, with an adjustment for the additional interest margin. These intercompany payable instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost, applying the effective interest rate method, to amortise the difference between the value initial recognised and redemption value of the assets. At 31 December 2023, $3,610m of amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings were due to Prudential Funding (Asia) Limited and due after more than one year in line with the terms of the external debt.",

The retained profit includes distributable reserves of $5,640 million (31 December 2022: $4,639 million) and non-distributable reserves of $5,752 million (31 December 2022: $5,715 million). The non-distributable reserves of the Company relate to gains on intra-group transactions, in which qualifying consideration was not received, and share-based payment reserves.\n\nUnder UK company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if sufficient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and non-distributable reserves (such as the share premium account) and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.\n\nThe retained profit of the Company is substantially generated from dividend income received from subsidiaries. The Group segmental analysis illustrates the generation of profit across the Group (see note B1.1 to the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements). The Group and its subsidiaries are subject to local regulatory minimum capital requirements, as set out in note C9 of the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements. A number of the principal risks set out in the Risk review report could impact the generation of profit in the Group's subsidiaries in the future and hence impact their ability to pay dividends in the future.\n\nIn determining the dividend payment in any year, the Directors follow the Group dividend policy described in the Financial review section of this Annual Report. The Directors consider the Company's ability to pay current and future dividends twice a year by reference to the Company's business plan and certain stressed scenarios.\n\n## 9   Other information\n\n- (a) Information on key management remuneration is given in note B2.3 to the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements. Additional information on directors' remuneration is given in the Directors' remuneration report section of this Annual Report.\n- (b) Information on transactions of the Directors with the Group is given in note D3 to the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n- (c) The Company employs no staff.\n- (d) Fees payable to the Company's auditor for the audit of the Company's annual accounts were $0.1 million (2022: $0.1 million) and for other services were $0.1 million (2022: $0.1 million).\n- (e) In certain instances, the Company has guaranteed that its subsidiaries will meet their obligations when they fall due for payment.\n\n## 10   Post balance sheet events\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023, which was approved by the Board of Directors after 31 December 2023, is described in note B5 of the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share repurchase programme to neutralise 2023 employee and agent share scheme issuance\n\nOn 16 January 2024, the Company announced that the share repurchase programme in respect of 3,851,376 ordinary shares that it announced on 5 January 2024 and commenced on 8 January has been completed. The purpose of the share repurchase programme was to offset dilution from the vesting of awards under employee and agent share schemes during 2023.  The Company has repurchased 3,851,376 ordinary shares in aggregate (representing 0.14 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in issue announced on 29 December 2023) at a volume weighted average price of \u00a38.2676 per ordinary share for a total consideration of approximately \u00a331,841,826.52.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;\n- - for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- - for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements;\n- - assess the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nThe directors of Prudential plc, whose names and positions are set out on pages 155 to 160 confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- - the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;\n- - the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and\n- - the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. In evaluating the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting we:\n\n- - confirmed our understanding of management's going concern assessment process and obtained management's assessment which covers the period to 31 March 2025;\n- - assessed management's evaluation of the liquidity and solvency position of the Group by reviewing base case and stressed liquidity and solvency projections through the going concern period;\n- - evaluated management's forecast analysis to understand the severity of  the downside scenarios that would be required to occur to result in the elimination of solvency and / or liquidity headroom and considered the actions available to management in such scenarios;\n- - performed enquiries of management and those charged with governance to identify risks or events that may impact the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n- - assessed the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures by comparing the disclosures with management's assessment and considering their compliance with the relevant reporting requirements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period of to 31 March 2025, being at least one year from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We took into account the size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of its control environment, changes in the business environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of the principal life insurance companies in  Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam and the CPL life insurance joint venture in China, ('full scope components'), which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.  For the life insurance companies in Taiwan and Thailand, the Eastspring asset management business and certain of the holding and service entities in the UK and Hong Kong ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within the component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nWe took a centralised approach to auditing certain processes and controls, as well as the substantive testing of specific account balances related to those processes. This included audits procedures over the Group's shared IT infrastructure and elements of the Group's IFRS 17 infrastructure that are managed and maintained centrally.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 87% of the Group's equity, 78% of the Group's Profit before tax, and 96% of the Group's Total assets. The table below shows the contribution of the full scope and specific components to these metrics, and to the Best estimate insurance contract liabilities and Release of CSM that are considered Key Audit Matters and described later in this report.\n\n|                                  | 2023         | 2023               | 2023         | 2023                                                   | 2023                    |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                  | Total equity | Profit  before tax | Total assets | Best estimate insurance contract  liabilities (Note 4) | Release of CSM (Note 4) |\n| Full scope                       | 63%          | 95%                | 83%          | 90%                                                    | 86%                     |\n| Specific scope (Note 3)          | 24%          | (17%)              | 13%          | 9%                                                     | 8%                      |\n|                                  |              | (Note 2)           |              |                                                        |                         |\n| Full and specific scope coverage | 87%          | 78%                | 96%          | 99%                                                    | 94%                     |\n| Remaining components (Note 5)    | 13%          | 22%                | 4%           | 1%                                                     | 6%                      |\n| Total reporting components       | 100%         | 100%               | 100%         | 100%                                                   | 100%                    |",

For the UK and Hong Kong holding and service companies and for the centralised processes and controls, audit procedures were performed directly by the primary audit team.  For the full scope and remaining specific scope components, audit procedures were performed by component audit teams. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nThe primary team were responsible for the scoping and direction of the audit process and interacted regularly with the component teams throughout the audit, including regular video conference meetings to provide updates on the Group, the audit approach and matters arising from the component audits.\n\nThe primary audit team followed a programme of planned visits that was designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor and/or other senior members of the primary team visited each component team and management of each component.  During the current year's audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to all component locations listed above. These visits involved oversight of work undertaken at those locations, discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, reviewing relevant audit working papers in key risk areas, meeting with local management, attending closing meetings and, for the largest four components, attending local Audit Committees.\n\nThe combination of these oversight procedures, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Prudential plc. The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change will be from strategy implementation, financial resilience, insurance and product risks, operational resilience, data and model limitations and regulatory, legislative and disclosure expectations. These are explained in the required Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures and on page 64 in the principal risks and uncertainties. The Group has also explained its climate commitments on page 100. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in note C6 Risk and sensitivity analysis how climate change has been reflected in the financial statements, and in particular that the application of three commonly used scenarios of plausible global responses to climate change do not indicate the need for explicit allowance for climate change within the current valuation of assets and liabilities.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 119-120 and their assessment that there is no need for explicit allowance for climate change within the valuation of assets and liabilities following the requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.  As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine any risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter.",

These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

This transition, which includes a number of key judgements required substantial focus during our audit.\n\nKey areas of focus in our audit of the IFRS 17 transition included:\n\n- a) Accounting policies - The risk of management's IFRS 17 accounting policies being inconsistent with the standard and their methodology papers reflecting inappropriate application of the policies.\n- b) Key judgement areas - The risk of inappropriate management judgment in applying IFRS 17 for key aspects of the standard including transition approach, determination of contract boundaries, eligibility for VFA, calculation of risk adjustment and determination of coverage units for release of CSM purposes.\n- c) Models - The risk that models used to calculate BEL at transition do not appropriately reflect the Group's IFRS 17 accounting policies and decisions on the judgment areas described above.\n- d) Transition approach - The risk that the calculation of the CSM on transition does not appropriately reflect the requirements of IFRS 17 where the full retrospective approach (FRA) or modified retrospective approach (MRA) was used, or IFRS 13 where the fair value approach (FVA) was used.\n- e) Transition balance sheet and related disclosures - The risk that the transition balance sheet disclosures are inaccurate, incomplete or do not meet the requirements of IFRS 17.\n\nUsing EY actuaries as members of our team we  performed the following procedures to address the risk in relation to the transition to IFRS 17:\n\n- - obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Group's controls over the transition to IFRS 17, including governance and approval of the IFRS 17 accounting policies and their application by the Group;\n- - evaluated management's accounting policies and methodology papers in comparison with IFRS 17, particularly in the key judgment areas set out in the 'risk area' column;\n- - for a sample of key products, we compared management's policy application decisions with underlying product features and supporting documentation;\n- - for a sample of models used to calculate the BEL at transition, we compared management's model validation results with the terms and conditions of the related insurance contracts and the Group's IFRS 17 valuation policies. For a selection of models, performed an independent recalculation of the BEL for a sample of ICGs and compared the results to the output of the cashflow model used by management;\n- - assessed management's judgements in respect of the application of transition approaches, including the impracticability of applying FRA to certain cohorts;\n- - for a sample of ICGs, we tested the valuation of the CSM at transition under each approach. For a sample of ICGs under MRA, we compared the modifications applied to the requirements of the standard and for a sample of ICGs under FVA, we compared the fair value assumptions and calculations to the requirements of IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement; and\n- - tested the appropriateness, accuracy and completeness of management's disclosures in respect of IFRS 17 transition in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nThrough the procedures performed, we have determined that management have appropriately implemented IFRS 17 within their financial reporting and this is reflected within the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be $170 million, which is c1% of total equity. We believe that total equity is an appropriate measure to set materiality as we believe that investors are mainly focused on the financial strength of the group, for which the most appropriate IFRS metric is equity, and growth and profitability metrics  based on the non-IFRS EEV reporting basis. We also consider that using total equity as a measure to set materiality is appropriate as investors and analysts are yet to develop consistent IFRS17 based profit metrics on which to assess company performance.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $165 million, which is 1% of total equity.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% of our planning materiality, namely $85m. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to this being the first year we will issue a statutory auditor's report for Prudential plc and due to the implementation of IFRS 17.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $19m to $38m.\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $9m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, comprising the Strategic Report, the Governance Report, the Directors' Remuneration Report, the EEV Basis Results and the Additional Financial Information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- - the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- - the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are the relevant laws and regulations related to elements of company law, insurance regulation and tax legislation, and the financial reporting framework. Our considerations of other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements included permissions and supervisory requirements of the listing authorities in the countries where the Company's shares and debt are listed. We also obtained an understanding of the laws and regulations in the territories in which the Group operates to consider if these would have a material effect on the financial statements.\n- - We understood how the Company is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and those responsible for legal and compliance matters.

        "page_content": "- - We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by assessing events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n- - Enquiring of Directors, the Audit Committee and Internal Audit\n- - Inspecting papers provided to those charged with governance as to the policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the Group's 'whistleblowing' policies and procedures along with the engagement with local management to identify fraud risks specific to their business units, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- - Reading Board and Audit Committee minutes.\n- - Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management.\n- - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquires of the Group's internal legal counsel, internal audit, certain senior management executives and focused testing on a sample basis, including journal entry testing. We also performed inspection of key regulatory correspondence from the relevant regulatory authorities as well as review of board and committee minutes.\n- - The fraud risk was considered to be higher within revenue recognition in respect of the release of CSM of due to the fact that the release of CSM represents a significant portion of the Company's insurance revenue.  Our procedures in this area are outlined above under our Key Audit Matters section under Revenue recognition in respect of the release of contractual service margin (CSM).\n- - We also considered there to be a higher fraud risk specifically related to non-economic assumptions, which affect the valuation of the insurance contract liabilities. We considered management override risk to be higher in this area due to significant judgements and estimates involved. Our procedures in this area included:\n- - Supported by our actuarial team, challenging management in relation to the selection of assumptions;\n- - Assessing the appropriateness of the rationale for any changes, the consistency of the selected assumptions across different aspects of the financial reporting process and comparison to our understanding of the product portfolio, trends in experience, policyholder behaviour, demographic changes and also by reference to market practice.\n- - To address the pervasive risk as it relates to management override, we also performed procedures including:\n- - Identifying journal entries based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation;\n- - Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n- - The Group operates in the insurance industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the Group audit engagement team and the component teams to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Group Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Company after approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2023 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023 and subsequent financial periods.\n\nThe period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 1 year.\n\nThe audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## John Headley (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nLondon, United Kingdom 19 March 2024",

All results are stated net of tax and converted using actual exchange rates (AER) unless otherwise stated. AER are actual historical exchange rates for the relevant accounting period. Constant exchange rate (CER) results are calculated by translating prior year results using current year foreign currency exchange rates, ie current year average rates for the income statement and current year closing rates for the balance sheet.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the preparation of the supplementary information in accordance with the EEV Principles. In preparing the EEV basis supplementary information, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group remains a going concern. Further information is provided in note A1 to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nEEV basis results\n\n## European Embedded Value (EEV) basis results\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nIFRS profit for insurance contracts largely reflects the level of services provided for a given period. Unearned future profits expected on those same insurance contracts are contained in a separate liability called the contractual service margin. These future profits have been derived on a risk neutral basis (including a liquidity premium), namely without allowing for the real world investment return that will be earned on the assets held. By contrast, EEV reflects all future profits, with no equivalent liability to the contractual service margin, but values those profits on a risk adjusted real world basis, namely allowing for the future investment returns that are expected to be earned by the assets held but uses a higher discount rate that allows for the uncertainties in these cash flows. The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.\n\nThe EEV Principles provide consistent definitions of the components of EEV, a framework for setting assumptions and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures. The EEV Principles were designed to provide guidance and common principles that could be understood by both users and preparers alongside prescribing a minimum level of disclosures to enable users to understand an entity's methodology, assumptions and key judgements as well as the sensitivity of an entity's EEV to key assumptions. Results prepared under the EEV Principles represent the present value of the shareholders' interest in the post-tax future profits (generally on a local statutory basis) expected to arise from the current book of long-term business, after sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in the business. The shareholders' interest in the Group's long-term business is the sum of the shareholders' total net worth and the value of in-force business.\n\nFor the purposes of preparing EEV results, insurance joint ventures and associates are included at the Group's proportionate share of their embedded value and not at their market value. Asset management and other non-insurance subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the EEV results at the Group's proportionate share of IFRS shareholders' equity, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis. Further information is contained in note 5.\n\nKey features of the Group's EEV methodology include:\n\nEconomic assumptions: The projected post-tax profits assume a level of future investment return and are discounted using a risk discount rate. Both the risk discount rate and the investment return assumptions are updated at each valuation date to reflect current market risk-free rates, such that changes in market risk-free rates impact all projected future cash flows. Risk-free rates, and hence investment return assumptions, are based on observable market data, with current market risk-free rates assumed to remain constant and do not revert to longer-term rates over time. Different products will be sensitive to different assumptions, for example, participating products or products with guarantees are likely to benefit disproportionately from higher assumed investment returns.\n\nTime value of financial options and guarantees: Explicit quantified allowances are made for the time value of financial options and guarantees (TVOG). The TVOG is determined by weighting the probability of outcomes across a large number of different economic scenarios and is typically less applicable to health and protection business that generally contains more limited financial options or guarantees. At 31 December 2023, the TVOG is $(290) million (31 December 2022: $(151) million). The magnitude of the TVOG at 31 December 2023 would be approximately equivalent to a 6 basis point (2022: 3 basis point) increase in the weighted average risk discount rate.\n\nAllowance for risk in the risk discount rates: Risk discount rates are set equal to the risk-free rate at the valuation date plus product-specific allowances for market and non-market risks. Risks that are explicitly captured elsewhere, such as via the TVOG, are not included in the risk discount rates.\n\nThe allowance for market risk is based on a product-by-product assessment of the sensitivity of shareholder cash flows to varying market returns. This approach reflects the inherent market risk in each product group and results in lower risk discount rates for products where the majority of shareholder profit is uncorrelated to market risk and appropriately higher risk discount rates for products where there is greater market exposure for shareholders.\n\nFor example, for health and protection products, which represent 51 per cent of the value of in-force business (31 December 2022: 51 per cent) and 40 per cent of new business profit (31 December 2022: 43 per cent), the major sources of shareholder profits are underwriting profits or fixed shareholder charges which have low market risk sensitivity. The proportion of health and protection business varies with interest rates as well as the mix of business sold in the current period.\n\nThe construct of UK-style with-profits or similar participating funds in some business units, representing 27 per cent of the value of in-force (31 December 2022: 26 per cent) and 14 per cent of new business profit (31 December 2022: 18 per cent), reduce the market volatility of both policyholder and shareholder cash flows due to smoothed bonus declarations and for some markets the presence of an estate. Accordingly, 78 per cent of the value of in-force (31 December 2022: 77 per cent) is products with low market risk sensitivity and this is reflected in the overall risk discount rate.\n\nFor unit-linked products where fund management charges fluctuate with the investment return, a portion of the profits will typically be more sensitive to market risk due to the higher proportion of equity-type assets in the investment portfolio resulting in a higher risk discount rate. This business represents 13 per cent of the value of in-force (31 December 2022: 17 per cent) and 4 per cent of the value of new business profit (31 December 2022: 11 per cent) which limits the impact on the overall risk discount rate.\n\nThe remaining parts of the business, 9 per cent of the value of in-force business (31 December 2022: 6 per cent) and 42 per cent of the value of new business (31 December 2022: 28 per cent), relate to other products not covered by the above. The high proportion of new business in the current period reflects the higher proportion of savings product in Hong Kong as the border reopened.\n\nThe allowance for non-market risk comprises a base Group-wide allowance of 50 basis points plus additional allowances for emerging market risk where appropriate. At 31 December 2023, the total allowance for non-market risk is equivalent to a $(3.0) billion (31 December 2022: $(2.8) billion) reduction, or around (7) per cent (31 December 2022: (7) per cent) of the embedded value.",

It represents amounts emerging from the in-force business during the year, net of amounts reinvested in writing new business. For asset management businesses, it equates to post-tax adjusted operating profit for the year. For insurance business, free surplus is generally based on (with adjustments including recognition of certain intangibles and other assets that may be inadmissible on a regulatory basis) the excess of the regulatory basis net assets (EEV total net worth) over the EEV capital required to support the covered business. For shareholder-backed businesses, the level of EEV required capital has been based on the Group Prescribed Capital Requirements (GPCR) used in our GWS (Group Wide Supervision) reporting as set out in note 7.1(e).\n\nAdjustments are also made to enable free surplus to be a better measure of shareholders' resources available for distribution as described in the reconciliation to GWS surplus as disclosed in note I(i) of the Additional unaudited financial information. For asset management and other noninsurance operations (including the Group's central operations), free surplus is taken to be IFRS shareholders' equity, net of goodwill attributable to shareholders, with central Group debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as capital resources under the Group's capital regime. A reconciliation of EEV free surplus to the GWS shareholder capital surplus over group minimum capital requirements is also set out in note I(i) of the Additional unaudited financial information.\n\n|                                                                                                            |      | 2023 $m                                   | 2023 $m                    | 2022 $m     | 2022 $m              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                            | Note | Insurance and asset management operations | Other (central) operations | Group total | Group total note (i) |\n| Expected transfer from in-force business                                                                   |      | 2,635                                     | -

This allows for consequential changes in the assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, local statutory reserves, capital requirements and risk discount rates (but excludes changes in the allowance for market risk);\n- - 1 per cent rise in equity and property yields;\n- - 1 per cent and 2 per cent increases in the risk discount rates. The main driver for changes in the risk discount rates from period to period is changes in interest rates, the impact of which is expected to be partially offset by a corresponding change in assumed investment returns, the effect of which is not included in the risk discount rate sensitivities. The impact of higher investment returns can be approximated as the difference between the sensitivity to increases in interest rates and the sensitivity to increases in risk discount rates;\n- - For embedded value only, 20 per cent fall in the market value of equity and property assets; and\n- - For embedded value only, holding the group minimum capital requirements (GMCR) under the GWS Framework in contrast to EEV required capital based on the group prescribed capital requirements (GPCR). This reduces the level of capital and therefore the level of charge deducted from the embedded value for the cost of locked-in required capital. This has the effect of increasing EEV.\n\nThe sensitivities shown below are for the impact of instantaneous and permanent changes (with no trending or mean reversion) on the embedded value of long-term business operations and include the combined effect on the value of in-force business and net assets (including derivatives) held at the valuation dates indicated. The results only allow for limited management actions, such as changes to future policyholder bonuses, where applicable. If such economic conditions persisted, the financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts shown below. In this case, management could also take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses. No change in the mix of the asset portfolio held at the valuation date is assumed when calculating sensitivities, while changes in the market value of those assets are recognised. The sensitivity impacts are expected to be non-linear. To aid understanding of this non-linearity, impacts of both a 1 per cent and 2 per cent increase to interest rates and risk discount rates are shown.\n\nIf the changes in assumptions shown in the sensitivities were to occur, the effects shown below would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following period, namely the effect of changes in economic assumptions and short-term fluctuations in investment returns. In addition to the sensitivity effects shown below, the other components of the profit for the following period would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions at the end of that period, for example, new business profit and expected return on existing business are calculated with reference to end of period economic assumptions.\n\n## New business profit from insurance business\n\n|                                                          | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| New business profit                                      | 3,125     | 2,184     |\n| Sensitivity to alternative economic assumptions:         |           |           |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 2% increase   | (175)     | 220       |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 1% increase   | (88)      | 134       |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 0.5% decrease | 35        | (97)      |\n| Equity/property yields - 1% rise                         | 139       | 160       |\n| Risk discount rates - 2% increase                        | (917)     | (551)     |\n| Risk discount rates - 1% increase                        | (529)     | (309)     |",

In the context of the Group, Africa's results are not materially impacted by the above sensitivities.\n\nNew business sensitivities vary with changes in business mix and APE sales volumes. In particular, the directional movements in the new business profit interest rate sensitivities from 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2023 reflect the significantly higher new business levels in 2023 along with a greater proportion of sales to Hong Kong.\n\nFor a 1 per cent increase in assumed interest rates, the $(2,172) million negative effect comprises a $(4,516) million negative impact of increasing the risk discount rate by 1 per cent, partially offset by a $2,344 million benefit from assuming 1 per cent higher investment returns. Similarly, for a 2 per cent increase in assumed interest rates the $(4,154) million negative effect comprises a $(8,015) million negative impact of increasing the risk discount rates by 2 per cent, partially offset by a $3,861 million benefit from higher assumed investment returns. Finally, for a 0.5 per cent decrease in assumed interest rates, there would be a $1,133 million positive effect reflecting the benefit of a 0.5 per cent reduction in risk discount rates being partially offset by lower assumed investment returns. These offsetting impacts are sensitive to economics and the net impact can therefore change from period to period depending on the current level of interest rates.\n\nIn order to illustrate the impact of varying specific economic assumptions, all other assumptions are held constant in the sensitivities above and therefore, the actual changes in embedded value, were these economic effects to materialise, may differ from the sensitivities shown. For example, market risk allowances would likely be increased within the risk discount rate if interest rates increased by 1 per cent, leading to a reduction of $(1,969) million (compared with the $(2,172) million impact shown above). However, if interest rates actually decreased by 0.5 per cent, it would lead to a $1,043 million increase (compared with the $1,133 million increase shown above).\n\n## (b) Sensitivity analysis - non-economic assumptions\n\nThe tables below show the sensitivity of the new business profit and the embedded value for long-term business operations to:\n\n- - 10 per cent proportionate decrease in maintenance expenses (for example, a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of $10 per annum would represent an expense assumption of $9 per annum);\n- - 10 per cent proportionate decrease in lapse rates (for example, a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of 5.0 per cent would represent a lapse rate of 4.5 per cent per annum); and\n- - 5 per cent proportionate decrease in base mortality (ie increased longevity) and morbidity rates.\n\n## New business profit from insurance business\n\n|                                       | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| New business profit                   | 3,125     | 2,184     |\n| Maintenance expenses - 10% decrease   | 61        | 48        |\n| Lapse rates - 10% decrease            | 212       | 134       |\n| Mortality and morbidity - 5% decrease | 114       | 99        |\n\n## Embedded value of insurance business\n\n|                                       | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Embedded value                        | 41,528           | 38,857           |\n| Maintenance expenses - 10% decrease   | 440              | 411              |\n| Lapse rates - 10% decrease            | 1,806            | 1,533            |\n| Mortality and morbidity - 5% decrease | 1,514            | 1,300            |",

Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate. The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Group's EEV reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities. The projected emergence of VIF and required capital into free surplus in 2023 will be the starting point for expected free surplus generation next year, after updating for operating and economic assumption changes.

income and expenditure represents the post-tax IFRS results for other (central) operations (before restructuring and IFRS 17 implementation costs). It mainly includes interest costs on core structural borrowings and corporate expenditure for head office functions that are not recharged/allocated to the insurance and asset management business.\n\nCertain costs incurred within the head office functions are recharged to the insurance operations and recorded within the results for those operations. The assumed future expenses within the value of in-force business for insurance operations allow for amounts expected to be recharged by the head office functions on a recurring basis. Other costs that are not recharged to the insurance operations are shown as part of other income and expenditure for the current period and are not included within the projection of future expenses for in-force insurance business.\n\nIn line with the EEV Principles, the allowance for the future costs of internal asset management services within the EEV results for long-term insurance operations excludes the projected future profits generated by any non-insurance entities within the Group in providing those services (ie the EEV for long-term insurance operations includes the projected future profit or loss from asset management and service companies that support the Group's covered insurance businesses). Following the implementation of IFRS 17, a similar adjustment is made to eliminate the intra-group profit within the results of central operations.\n\nThe EEV shareholders' equity for other operations is taken to be IFRS shareholders' equity, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis. Free surplus for other operations is taken to be IFRS shareholders' equity, net of goodwill attributable to equity holders, with central Group debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as capital resources under the Group's capital regime. Under the GWS Framework, debt instruments issued at the date of designation which met the transitional conditions set by the Hong Kong IA are included as GWS eligible group capital resources. In addition, debt issued since the date of designation which met the qualifying conditions as set out in the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules are also included as GWS eligible group capital resources.\n\nShareholders' equity for other operations can be compared across metrics as shown in the table below.\n\n|                                                               | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| IFRS shareholders' equity                                     | 2,018     | 1,495     |\n| Mark-to-market value adjustment on central borrowings  note 6 | 274       | 427       |\n| EEV shareholders' equity                                      | 2,292     | 1,922     |\n| Debt instruments treated as capital resources                 | 3,356     | 3,629     |\n| Free surplus of other (central) operations                    | 5,648     | 5,551     |",

Covered business represents the Group's long-term insurance business (including the Group's investments in joint venture and associate insurance operations), for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.\n\nThe EEV results for the Group's covered business are then combined with the post-tax IFRS results of the Group's asset management and other operations (including interest costs on core structural borrowings and corporate expenditure for head office functions that is not recharged/ allocated to the insurance operations), with an adjustment to deduct the unwind of expected margins on the internal management of the assets of the covered business. Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management, as described in note (g) below.\n\n## (b) Valuation of in-force and new business\n\nThe EEV basis results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses, as described in note 8(c). These assumptions are used to project future cash flows. The present value of the projected future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate, as shown in note 8(a), which reflects both the time value of money and all other non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.\n\nThe total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated under the EEV basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis. Since the EEV basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under the EEV methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profit with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the period.\n\n## New business\n\nIn determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing regular and single premium business as set out in the Group's new business sales reporting.\n\nNew business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to the covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment contracts under IFRS 17. New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.\n\nNew business profit represents profit determined by applying operating and economic assumptions as at the end of the period. New business profitability is a key metric for the Group's management of the development of the business. In addition, new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalent (APE) and the present value of new business premiums (PVNBP). These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP. APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums on new business written in the period and one-tenth of single premiums. PVNBP is calculated as the aggregate of single premiums and the present value of expected future premiums from regular premium new business, allowing for lapses and the other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business profit.",

        "page_content": "## (c) Cost of capital\n\nA charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of locked-in required capital supporting the Group's long-term business. The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital held and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital, allowing for posttax investment earnings on the capital.\n\nThe EEV results are affected by the movement in this cost from period to period, which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.\n\nWhere required capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets within the fund is already adjusted to reflect its expected release over time and so no further adjustment to the shareholder position is necessary.\n\n## (d) Financial options and guarantees Nature of financial options and guarantees\n\nParticipating products, principally written in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, have both guaranteed and nonguaranteed elements. These products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed. There are two types of bonuses: regular and final. Regular bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular products. Final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.\n\nThere are also various non-participating long-term products with guarantees. The principal guarantees are those for whole-of-life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that typically accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions. Similar to participating products, the policyholder charges incorporate an allowance for the cost of providing these guarantees, which, for certain whole-oflife products in Hong Kong, remains constant throughout varying economic conditions, rather than reducing as the economic environment improves and vice versa.\n\n## Time value\n\nThe value of financial options and guarantees comprises the intrinsic value (arising from a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions) and the time value (arising from the variability of economic outcomes in the future).\n\nWhere appropriate (ie where financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology), a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of financial options and guarantees. The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations. Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions. Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, such as separate modelling of individual asset classes with an allowance for correlations between various asset classes. Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in note 8(b).\n\nIn deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled. Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of regular and final bonuses and credited rates. Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions. In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options available to management.\n\n## (e) Level of required capital and net worth\n\nIn adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on the applicable local statutory regulations, including any amounts considered to be required above the local statutory minimum requirements to satisfy regulatory constraints.\n\nFor shareholder-backed businesses, the level of required capital has been based on the GPCR.\n\n- - For CPL, the level of required capital follows the approach for embedded value reporting issued by the China Association of Actuaries (CAA) reflecting the C-ROSS regime. The CAA has started a project to assess whether any changes are required to the embedded value guidance in the Chinese Mainland given changes in regulatory rules, regulations and the external market environment since the standard was first issued. To date, no outcomes have been proposed by the CAA and Prudential has made no change to its EEV basis for CPL in 2023. At such time that there is a new basis, Prudential will consider the effect of proposals.\n- - For Hong Kong participating business, the HK RBC regime recognises the value of future shareholder transfers on an economic basis as available capital with an associated required capital. Within EEV, the shareholder value of participating business continues to be recognised as VIF with no recognition within free surplus and no associated required capital.\n- - For Singapore life operations, the level of net worth and required capital is based on the Tier 1 Capital position under the risk-based capital framework (RBC2), which removes certain negative reserves permitted to be recognised in the full RBC2 regulatory position applicable to the Group's GWS capital position, in order to better reflect free surplus and its generation.\n\nFree surplus is the shareholders' net worth in excess of required capital. For the Hong Kong business, the HK RBC framework requires liabilities to be valued on a best estimate basis and capital requirements to be risk based. EEV free surplus excludes regulatory surplus that arises where HK RBC technical provisions are lower than policyholder asset shares or cash surrender values to more realistically reflect how the business is managed.",

The EEV methodology includes the value attributed to the shareholders' interest in the residual estate of the in-force with-profits business. In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders. As required, adjustments are also made to reflect any capital requirements for with-profits business in excess of the capital resources of the with-profits funds.\n\n## (g) Internal asset management\n\nIn line with the EEV Principles, the long-term business EEV includes the projected future profit from asset management and service companies that support the Group's covered insurance businesses. The results of the Group's asset management operations include the current period profit from the management of both internal and external funds. EEV basis shareholders' other income and expenditure is adjusted to deduct the expected profit anticipated to arise in the current period in the opening VIF from internal asset management and other services. This deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business. Accordingly, Group operating profit includes the actual profit earned in respect of the management of these assets.\n\n## (h) Allowance for risk and risk discount rates Overview\n\nUnder the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows are set by reference to risk-free rates plus a risk margin.\n\nThe risk-free rates are largely based on local government bond yields at the valuation date and are assumed to remain constant and do not revert to longer-term rates over time.\n\nThe risk margin reflects any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation. In order to better reflect differences in relative market risk volatility inherent in each product group, Prudential sets the risk discount rates to reflect the expected volatility associated with the expected future shareholder cash flows for each product group in the embedded value model, rather than at a Group level.\n\nWhere financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, risk discount rates exclude the effect of these product features.\n\nThe risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk and allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk. No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.\n\n## Market risk allowance\n\nThe allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by the equity risk premium.\n\nThe beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk. The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product-specific cash flows. These are determined by considering how the profit from each product is affected by changes in expected returns across asset classes. By converting this into a relative rate of return, it is possible to derive a product-specific beta. This approach contrasts with a top-down approach to market risk where the risks associated with each product are not directly reflected in the valuation basis.\n\nThe Group's methodology allows for credit risk in determining the best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance, which covers expected long-term defaults, a credit risk premium (to reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels) and short-term downgrades and defaults.\n\n## Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks\n\nThe majority of non-market and non-credit risks are considered to be diversifiable. The allowance for non-market risk comprises a base Groupwide allowance of 50 basis points plus additional allowances for emerging market risk where appropriate. The level and application of these allowances are reviewed and updated based on assessment of the Group's exposure and experience in the markets.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the total allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk is equivalent to a $(3.0) billion, or (7) per cent, reduction to the embedded value of insurance business operations.\n\n## (i) Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at closing exchange rates. The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the Group IFRS financial statements.\n\n## (j) Taxation\n\nIn determining the post-tax profit for the period for covered business, the overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis. Tax payments and receipts included in the projected future cash flows to determine the value of in-force business are calculated using tax rates that have been announced and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## 7.2 Accounting presentation\n\n## (a) Analysis of post-tax profit\n\nTo the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV profit or loss for the period is consistent with the classification between operating and nonoperating results that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS results. Operating results are determined as described in note (b) below and incorporate the following:\n\n- - New business profit, as defined in note 7.1(b) above;\n- - Expected return on existing business, as described in note (c) below;\n- - The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to operating assumptions, as described in note (d) below; and\n- - Operating experience variances, as described in note (e) below.\n\nIn addition, operating results include the effect of changes in tax legislation, unless these changes are one-off and structural in nature, or primarily affect the level of projected investment returns, in which case they are reflected as a non-operating result.\n\n## Non-operating results comprise:\n\n- - Short-term fluctuations in investment returns;\n- - Mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings;\n- - Effect of changes in economic assumptions; and\n- - The impact of corporate transactions, if any, undertaken in the year.\n\nTotal profit or loss in the period attributable to shareholders and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns. The Group believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.\n\n## (b) Investment returns included in operating profit\n\nFor the investment element of the assets covering the total net worth of long-term insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rates of return. These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.\n\n## (c) Expected return on existing business\n\nExpected return on existing business comprises the expected unwind of discounting effects on the opening value of in-force business and required capital and the expected return on existing free surplus. The unwind of discount and the expected return on existing free surplus are determined after adjusting for the effect of changes in economic and operating assumptions in the current period on the embedded value at the beginning of the period, for example, the unwind of discount on the value of in-force business and required capital is determined after adjusting both the opening value and the risk discount rates for the effect of changes in economic and operating assumptions in the current period.\n\n## (d) Effect of changes in operating assumptions\n\nOperating profit includes the effect of changes to operating assumptions on the value of in-force business at the end of the reporting period. For presentational purposes the effect of changes is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of in-force business as operating assumption changes, with the experience variances subsequently being determined by reference to the assumptions at the end of the reporting period, as discussed below.\n\n## (e) Operating experience variances\n\nOperating profit includes the effect of experience variances on operating assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, expenses and other factors, which are calculated with reference to the assumptions at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## (f) Effect of changes in economic assumptions\n\nMovements in the value of in-force business at the beginning of the period caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related changes in the time value of financial options and guarantees, are recorded in non-operating results.",

Both the risk discount rate and expected rates of return are updated at each valuation date to reflect current market risk-free rates, with the effect that changes in market risk-free rates impact projected future cash flows. The risk-free rates of return are largely based on local government bond yields and are assumed to remain constant and do not revert to longer-term rates over time. The risk-free rates of return are shown below for each of the Group's insurance operations. Expected returns on equity and property assets and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium to the risk-free rate based on the Group's long-term view and, where relevant, allowing for market volatility.\n\nAs described in note 7.1(h), risk discount rates are set equal to the risk-free rate at the valuation date plus allowances for market risk and nondiversifiable non-market risks appropriate to the features and risks of the underlying products and markets.\n\nRisks that are explicitly allowed for elsewhere in the EEV basis, such as via the cost of capital and the time value of options and guarantees, as set out in note 2(i), are not included in the risk discount rates.\n\nRisk discount rate %\n\n|                                                       |              |              |                   |                   | 10-year government bond yield   | 10-year government bond yield   | Equity return   | Equity return   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                       | New business | New business | In-force business | In-force business | %                               | %                               | (geometric) %   | (geometric) %   |\n|                                                       | 31 Dec       | 31 Dec       | 31 Dec            | 31 Dec            | 31 Dec                          | 31 Dec                          | 31 Dec          | 31 Dec          |\n|                                                       | 2023         | 2022         | 2023              | 2022              | 2023                            | 2022                            | 2023            | 2022            |\n| CPL                                                   | 7.1          | 7.4          | 7.1               | 7.4               | 2.6                             | 2.9                             | 6.6             | 6.9             |\n| Hong Kong  note (i)                                   | 4.7          | 4.8          | 5.5               | 5.5               | 3.9                             | 3.9                             | 7.4             | 7.4             |\n| Indonesia                                             | 9.0          | 10.0         | 9.9               | 10.6              | 6.7                             | 7.3                             | 11.0            | 11.5            |\n| Malaysia                                              | 5.6          | 5.8          | 6.2               | 6.5               | 3.8                             | 4.1                             | 7.3             | 7.6             |\n| Philippines                                           | 12.3         | 14.5         | 12.3              | 14.5              | 6.1                             | 7.3                             | 10.3            | 11.5            |\n| Singapore                                             | 4.6          | 5.0          | 4.8               | 5.2               | 2.7                             | 3.1                             | 6.2             | 6.6             |\n| Taiwan                                                | 3.3          | 3.5          | 4.2               | 4.0               | 1.3                             | 1.3                             | 5.3             | 5.3             |\n| Thailand                                              | 10.0         | 10.0         | 10.0              | 10.0              | 2.8                             | 2.7                             | 7.0             | 7.0             |\n| Vietnam                                               | 3.7          | 6.9          | 4.1               | 6.7               | 2.3                             | 5.0                             | 6.6             | 9.3             |\n| Total weighted average (new business)  note (ii)      | 5.6          | 6.9          | n/a               | n/a               | 3.8                             | 4.2                             | 7.2             | 7.5             |\n| Total weighted average (in-force business)  note (ii) | n/a          | n/a          | 5.9               | 6.4               | 3.6                             | 4.0                             | 7.1             | 7.6             |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (i) For Hong Kong, the assumptions shown are for US dollar denominated business. For other businesses, the assumptions shown are for local currency denominated business.\n- (ii) Total weighted average assumptions have been determined by weighting each business's assumptions by reference to the EEV basis new business profit and the closing net value of in-force business. The changes in the risk discount rates for individual businesses reflect the movements in the local government bond yields, changes in the allowances for market risk (including as a result of changes in asset mix), and, if applicable, non-diversifiable non-market risk, and changes in product mix.\n\n## (b) Stochastic assumptions\n\nDetails are given below of the key characteristics of the models used to determine the time value of financial options and guarantees as referred to in note 7.1(d).\n\n- - The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily of significance for the Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses;\n- - The principal asset classes are government bonds, corporate bonds and equity;\n- - Interest rates are projected using a stochastic interest rate model calibrated to the current market yields;\n- - Equity returns are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution;\n- - The corporate bond return is calculated based on a risk-free return plus a mean-reverting spread;\n- - The volatility of equity returns ranges from 17 per cent to 35 per cent for both years; and\n- - The volatility of government bond yields ranges from 1.1 per cent to 2.0 per cent for both years.\n\n## (c) Operating assumptions\n\nBest estimate assumptions are used for projecting future cash flows, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes. The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain. Where experience is expected to be adverse over the short term, a provision may be established.\n\nAssumptions required in the calculation of the time value of financial options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.",

        "page_content": "## Demographic assumptions\n\nPersistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience, and reflect expected future experience. When projecting future cash flows for medical reimbursement business that is repriced annually, explicit allowance is made for expected future premium inflation and separately for future medical claims inflation.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nExpense levels, including those of the service companies that support the Group's long-term business, are based on internal expense analysis and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business. For mature business, it is Prudential's policy not to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the actions to achieve the savings have been delivered. Expense overruns are reported where these are expected to be short-lived, including businesses that are growing rapidly or are sub-scale.\n\nExpenses comprise costs borne directly and costs recharged/allocated from the Group head office functions in London and Hong Kong that are attributable to the long-term insurance (covered) business. The assumed future expenses for the long-term insurance business allow for amounts expected to be recharged/allocated by the head office functions.\n\nCorporate expenditure, which is included in other income and expenditure, comprises expenditure of the Group head office functions in London and Hong Kong that is not recharged/allocated to the long-term insurance or asset management operations, primarily for corporate related activities that are charged as incurred, together with restructuring and IFRS 17 implementation costs incurred across the Group.\n\n## Tax rates\n\nThe assumed long-term effective tax rates for operations reflect the expected incidence of taxable profit or loss in the projected future cash flows as explained in note 7.1(j). The local standard corporate tax rates applicable are as follows:\n\n|             | %                             |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| CPL         | 25.0                          |\n| Hong Kong   | 16.5% on 5% of premium income |\n| Indonesia   | 22.0                          |\n| Malaysia    | 24.0                          |\n| Philippines | 25.0                          |\n| Singapore   | 17.0                          |\n| Taiwan      | 20.0                          |\n| Thailand    | 20.0                          |\n| Vietnam     | 20.0                          |",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to Prudential plc on the European Embedded Value (EEV) basis supplementary information\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the European Embedded Value ('EEV') Basis Results of Prudential plc ('the Company' and, together with its subsidiaries, 'the Group') for the year ended 31 December 2023, which comprise the EEV results highlights, the movement in Group EEV shareholders' equity, the movement in Group free surplus and the related notes, including the basis of preparation on page 344. The EEV Basis Results should be read in conjunction with the Group financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the EEV Basis Results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in 2016 ('the EEV Principles') using the methodology and assumptions set out in the basis of preparation note on page 344.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) including 'ISA (UK) 800 (Revised) Special Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks'. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the EEV Basis Results section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the EEV Basis Results in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of matter - basis of preparation and restriction on use\n\nWe draw attention to the special purpose basis of preparation on page 344. The EEV Basis Results are prepared to provide additional information to users of the Group financial statements. As a result, the EEV Basis Results may not be suitable for another purpose. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\nOur report is intended solely for the Company, in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated 25 May 2023. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we have been engaged to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the EEV Basis Results, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the EEV Basis Results is appropriate.\n\nIn evaluating the Directors' assessment of the Group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting we:\n\n- - confirmed our understanding of management's going concern assessment process and obtained management's assessment which covers the period to 31 March 2025;\n- - assessed management's evaluation of the liquidity and solvency position of the Group by reviewing base case and stressed liquidity and solvency projections through the going concern period;\n- - evaluated management's forecast analysis to understand the severity of the downside scenarios that would be required to occur to result in the elimination of solvency and / or liquidity headroom and considered the actions available to management in such scenarios ;\n- - performed enquiries of management and those charged with governance to identify risks or events that may impact the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n- - assessed the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures by comparing the disclosures with management's assessment and considering their compliance with the relevant reporting requirements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 March 2025, being at least one year from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the EEV Basis Results and our auditor's report thereon.  The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the EEV Basis Results does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the EEV Basis Results or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the EEV Basis Results themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities of directors\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the EEV Basis Results in accordance with the EEV Principles using the methodology and assumptions set out in the special purpose basis of preparation on page 344, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the EEV Basis Results that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the EEV Basis Results, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the EEV Basis Results\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the EEV Basis Results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these EEV Basis Results.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.   The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n- - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are the relevant laws and regulations related to elements of company law, insurance regulation and tax legislation, and the financial reporting framework. Our considerations of other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the EEV Basis Results included permissions and supervisory requirements of the listing authorities in the countries where the Company's shares and debt are listed.\n- - We understood how the Company is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Company and regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and its Committees; and gained an understanding of the Company's approach to governance, demonstrated by the Board's approval of the Company's governance framework.\n- - We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's EEV Basis Results to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by assessing events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n- - Enquiring of Directors, the Audit Committee, Internal Audit and inspecting papers provided to those charge with governance as to the policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the Group's 'whistleblowing' policies and procedures along with the engagement with local management to identify fraud risks specific to their business units, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- - Reading Board and Audit Committee minutes.\n- - Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management.\n\nWe identified a fraud risk related to the selection of EEV operating assumptions given their direct impact on the Group's embedded value, the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate.\n\n- - In determining the audit procedures to address the identified fraud risks, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the group-wide fraud prevention controls. In order to address the risk of fraud specifically as it relates to the EEV operating assumptions, we involved actuarial specialists to assist in our challenge of management. We challenged management in relation to the selection of assumptions and the appropriateness of the rationale for any changes, the consistency of the selected assumptions across different aspects of the financial reporting process and comparison to our understanding of the product portfolio, trends in experience, policyholder behaviour and economic conditions and also by reference to market practice.\n- - To address the pervasive risk as it relates to management override, we also performed procedures including:\n- - Identifying journal entries based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n- - Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the EEV Basis Results is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https:// www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Headley for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP London 19 March 2024",

Alongside the total regulatory GWS capital basis, a shareholder GWS capital basis is also presented which excludes the contribution to the Group GWS eligible group capital resources, the Group Minimum Capital Requirements (GMCR) and the Group Prescribed Capital Requirements (GPCR) from these participating funds.\n\n## Estimated GWS capital position\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the estimated shareholder GWS capital surplus over the GPCR is $16.1 billion (31 December 2022: $15.6 billion), representing a coverage ratio of 295 per cent (31 December 2022: 307 per cent) and the estimated total GWS capital surplus over the GPCR is $19.0 billion (31 December 2022: $18.1 billion), representing a coverage ratio of 197 per cent (31 December 2022: 202 per cent). The estimated Group Tier 1 capital resources are $18.3 billion with headroom over the GMCR of $12.4 billion (31 December 2022: $12.1 billion), representing a coverage ratio of 313 per cent (31 December 2022: 328 per cent).\n\nnote (1)\n\n|                                                    | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023               | 31 Dec 2023    | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022               | 31 Dec 2022    | 31 Dec 2022              |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                    | Shareholder   | Add policyholder note (3) | Total note (4) | Shareholder   | Add policyholder note (3) | Total note (4) | Change in total note (5) |\n| Group capital resources ($bn)                      | 24.3          | 14.3                      | 38.6           | 23.2          | 12.6                      | 35.8           | 2.8                      |\n| of which: Tier 1 capital resources ($bn)  note (2) | 17.1          | 1.2                       | 18.3           | 15.9          | 1.5                       | 17.4           | 0.9                      |\n| Group Minimum Capital Requirement ($bn)            | 4.8           | 1.1                       | 5.9            | 4.4           | 0.9                       | 5.3            | 0.6                      |\n| Group Prescribed Capital Requirement ($bn)         | 8.2           | 11.4                      | 19.6           | 7.6           | 10.1                      | 17.7           | 1.9                      |\n| GWS capital surplus over GPCR ($bn)                | 16.1          | 2.9                       | 19.0           | 15.6          | 2.5                       | 18.1           | 0.9                      |\n| GWS coverage ratio over GPCR (%)                   | 295 %         |                           | 197 %          | 307 %         |                           | 202 %          | (5) %                    |\n| GWS Tier 1 surplus over GMCR ($bn)                 |               |                           | 12.4           |               |                           | 12.1           | 0.3                      |\n| GWS Tier 1 coverage ratio over GMCR (%)            |               |                           | 313 %          |               |                           | 328 %          | (15) %                   |\n\n## Notes\n\n## GWS sensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated sensitivity of the GWS capital position (based on the GPCR) to changes in market conditions as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 are shown below, for both the shareholder and the total capital position.\n\n|                                             | Shareholder   | Shareholder    | Shareholder   | Shareholder    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n|                                             | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2023    | 31 Dec 2022   | 31 Dec 2022    |\n| Impact of market sensitivities              | Surplus ($bn) | Coverage ratio | Surplus ($bn) | Coverage ratio |\n| Base position                               | 16.1          | 295 %          | 15.6          | 307%           |\n| Impact of:                                  |               |                |               |                |\n| 10% increase in equity markets              | 0.4           | (3) %          | 0.3           | (3)%           |\n| 20% fall in equity markets                  | (2.5)         | (17) %         | (1.9)         | (14)%          |\n| 50 basis points reduction in interest rates | 0.7           | 11 %           | 0.4           | 4%             |\n| 100 basis points increase in interest rates | (2.1)         | (25) %         | (1.1)         | (15)%          |\n| 100 basis points increase in credit spreads | (1.0)         | (12) %         | (0.8)         | (9)%           |",

The sensitivity results assume instantaneous market movements and reflect all consequential impacts as at the valuation date. These results also allow for limited management actions such as changes to future policyholder bonuses and rebalancing investment portfolios where relevant. If such economic conditions persisted, the financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts shown above. In this case, management could also take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses. These actions include, but are not limited to, market risk hedging, further rebalancing of investment portfolios, increased use of reinsurance, repricing of in-force benefits, changes to new business pricing and the mix of new business being sold.\n\n## GWS Risk Appetite and capital management\n\nThe Group's capital management framework focuses on achieving sustainable, profitable growth and retaining a resilient balance sheet.\n\nThe Group monitors regulatory capital, economic capital and rating agency capital metrics and manages the business within its risk appetite by remaining within its economic and regulatory capital limits. In respect of regulatory capital limits, a capital buffer above the GPCR is held to ensure the Group can withstand volatility in markets and operational experience, with capital resources remaining sufficient to cover the GPCR even after significant stresses. The calibration of the capital buffer reflects the Group's risk profile and the external economic environment, and is set and reviewed regularly by the Board.\n\nTypically, this requires a Group shareholder coverage ratio of above 150 per cent of the shareholder GPCR to be maintained and de-risking management actions will be taken as necessary to maintain this buffer. No maximum limit on the GWS coverage ratio has been set. While the GWS shareholder capital position is a key metric for assessing regulatory solvency, and for risk management, there are some elements of the shareholder GWS capital surplus which will only become available as cash flow for distribution over time. The Group's Free Surplus metric is a better measure of the shareholder capital available for distribution, and is used as the primary metric for assessing the Group's sources and uses of capital in the Group's capital management framework, and underpinning the Group's dividend policy.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's Free Surplus stock (excluding distribution rights and other intangibles) was $8.5 billion, compared to the GWS shareholder surplus of $16.1 billion and a reconciliation is shown below.\n\nThe uses of capital, for both organic and inorganic opportunities, are assessed by reference to expected shareholder returns and payback periods, relative to risk-adjusted hurdle rates which are set centrally.\n\nReflecting the Group's capital allocation priorities, a portion of the free surplus generated in each period will be retained for reinvestment in new business and capabilities, particularly in the areas of Customer, Distribution, Health and Technology, and dividends will be determined primarily based on the Group's operating free surplus generation after allowing for the capital strain of writing new business and recurring central costs. Recognising our conviction in the Group's revised strategy, when determining the annual dividend we look through the investments in new business and investments in capabilities and continue to expect the 2024 annual dividend to grow in the range of 7 to 9 per cent. To the extent that free surplus arises which is not required to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities, consideration will be given to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nSeparate from the capital management framework applied for shareholder-owned capital, the capital held in ring-fenced with-profits funds supports policyholder investment freedom, which increases expected returns for our with-profits funds' customers. GWS policyholder capital surplus is not available for distribution out of the ring-fenced funds other than as a defined proportion distributable to shareholders when policyholder bonuses are declared. Policyholder fund capital surplus is deployed over time to increase investment risk in the with-profits funds in order to target higher customer returns, or distributed as higher customer bonuses, in line with the specific with-profits bonus policies which apply to each ring-fenced fund. The result of applying these policies is that the aggregate policyholder fund GPCR coverage ratio is typically lower than the GPCR shareholder coverage ratio.\n\nThe total GWS coverage ratio, which is an aggregate of the policyholder and shareholder capital positions, is therefore usually lower than the shareholder coverage ratio, but also less sensitive in stress scenarios, as is shown in the GWS sensitivity analysis section above as at 31 December 2023. The total GWS coverage ratio is the Group's regulatory solvency metric to which Group supervision applies, and this total regulatory coverage ratio is managed to ensure it remains above the GPCR by applying separate shareholder and policyholder risk appetite limits, as described above.",

This includes movements in distribution rights and other intangibles (which are expensed on day one under the GWS requirements) and movements in the restriction applied to free surplus to better reflect shareholder resources that are available for distribution.\n\n## Material changes in GMCR, GPCR, tier 1 group capital and eligible group capital resources\n\nDetail on the material changes in GPCR, GMCR, eligible group capital resources and tier 1 group capital are provided below.\n\n- - Total eligible capital resources has increased by $2.8 billion to $38.6 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $35.8 billion). This includes a $0.9 billion increase in tier 1 group capital to $18.3 billion (31 December 2022: $17.4 billion). The increase in total eligible capital resources and tier 1 group capital is primarily driven by positive operating capital generation over the year, partially offset by external dividends paid, debt redeemed and market movements over the year.\n- - Total regulatory GPCR has increased by $1.9 billion to $19.6 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $17.7 billion) and the total regulatory GMCR has increased by $0.6 billion to $5.9 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $5.3 billion). The increase in GPCR and GMCR is primarily driven by new business sold over the year, partially offset by the release of capital as the policies mature or are surrendered and market movements over the year.\n\n## Reconciliation of Free Surplus to total regulatory GWS capital surplus (over GPCR)\n\n|                                                                    | 31 Dec 2023 $bn   | 31 Dec 2023 $bn   | 31 Dec 2023 $bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                    | Capital resources | Required capital  | Surplus           |\n| Free surplus excluding distribution rights and other intangibles*  | 14.5              | 6.0               | 8.5               |\n| Restrictions applied in free surplus for China C-ROSS II  note (1) | 1.7               | 1.4               | 0.3               |\n| Restrictions applied in free surplus for HK RBC  note (2)          | 6.1               | 0.7               | 5.4               |\n| Restrictions applied in free surplus for Singapore RBC  note(3)    | 2.0               | 0.1               | 1.9               |\n| Add GWS policyholder surplus contribution                          | 14.3              | 11.4              | 2.9               |\n| Total regulatory GWS capital surplus (over GPCR)                   | 38.6              | 19.6              | 19.0              |\n\n## Notes",

The summation of local statutory capital requirements across the Group is used to determine group regulatory capital requirements, with no allowance for diversification between business operations. The GWS eligible group capital resources is determined by the summation of capital resources across local solvency regimes for regulated entities and IFRS shareholders' equity (with adjustments described below) for non-regulated entities.\n\nIn determining the GWS eligible group capital resources and required capital the following principles have been applied:\n\n- - For regulated insurance entities, capital resources and required capital are based on the local solvency regime applicable in each jurisdiction, with minimum required capital set at the solo legal entity statutory minimum capital requirements and prescribed capital requirement set at the level at which the local regulator of a given entity can impose penalties, sanctions or intervention measures;\n- - The classification of tiering of eligible capital resources under the GWS framework reflects the different local regulatory regimes along with guidance issued by the Hong Kong IA. In general, if a local regulatory regime applies a tiering approach then this should be used to determine tiering of capital on a GWS capital basis, where a local regulatory regime does not apply a tiering approach then all capital resources should be included as Group Tier 1 capital. For non-regulated entities tiering of capital is determined in line with the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules.\n- - For asset management operations and other regulated entities, the capital position is derived based on the sectoral basis applicable in each jurisdiction, with minimum required capital based on the solo legal entity statutory minimum capital requirement;\n- - For non-regulated entities, the capital resources are based on IFRS shareholder equity after deducting intangible assets. No required capital is held in respect of unregulated entities;\n- - For entities where the Group's interest is less than 100 per cent, the contribution of the entity to the GWS eligible group capital resources and required capital represents the Group's share of these amounts and excludes any amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. This does not apply to investment holdings which are not part of the Group;\n- - Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (including, if any, loans that are recognised as capital on the receiving entity's balance sheet) are eliminated from the relevant holding company to prevent the double counting of capital resources;\n- - Under the GWS Framework, debt instruments in issuance at the date of designation that satisfy the criteria for transitional arrangements and qualifying debt issued since the date of designation are included in eligible group capital resources as tier 2 group capital;\n- - At 31 December 2023 all debt instruments with the exception of the senior debt issued in 2022 are included as Group capital resources. The eligible amount permitted to be included as Group capital resources for transitional debt is based on the net proceeds amount translated using 31 December 2020 exchange rates for debt not denominated in US dollars;\n- - The total company GWS capital basis is the capital measure for Hong Kong IA Group regulatory purposes as set out in the GWS framework. This framework defines the eligible group capital resources coverage ratio (or total company GWS coverage ratio over GPCR as presented above) as the ratio of total company eligible group capital resources to the total company GPCR and defines the tier 1 group capital coverage ratio (or total company GWS tier 1 coverage ratio over GMCR as presented above) as the ratio of total company tier 1 group capital to the total company GMCR; and\n- - Prudential also presents a shareholder GWS capital basis which excludes the contribution to the Group GWS eligible group capital resources, the GMCR and GPCR from participating business in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. In Hong Kong the present value of future shareholder transfers from the participating business are included in the shareholder GWS eligible capital resources along with an associated required capital, this is in line with the local solvency presentation. The shareholder GWS coverage ratio over GPCR presented above reflects the ratio of shareholder eligible group capital resources to the shareholder GPCR.",

In addition, Eastspring advises on certain funds for the Group's insurance operations where the investment management is delegated to third-party investment managers. The table below analyses the total funds managed or advised by Eastspring.\n\nDuring the year the Group has reclassified its funds under management, and associated income, between retail and institutional categories. Amounts are now classified as retail or institutional based on whether the owner of the holding, where known, is a retail or institutional investor. Under the previous basis amounts were classified based on the nature of the investment vehicle in which the amounts were invested. The revised classification presents the funds held by each client type on a more consistent basis, which aligns with typical differences in fee rate basis for each client type. Comparatives have been restated to be on a comparable basis.",

They are, however, a driver of profitability. Prudential therefore analyses the movement in the funds under management each year, focusing on those which are external to the Group and those primarily held by the Group's insurance businesses. The table below analyses the funds of the Group held in the balance sheet and the external funds that are managed by Prudential's asset management businesses.",

Although circa 6 per cent of the embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown is considered most meaningful. The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Group's embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2023 results.\n\nIn addition to showing the amounts, on both a discounted and undiscounted basis, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2023, the table also presents the future free surplus expected to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2023 over the same 40-year period.\n\n|                                                            | 31 Dec 2023 $m

The purpose of these arrangements are to incentivise and retain eligible employees of the Group or, in the case of the Agency LTIP and the ISSOSNE, eligible agents based in certain business units of the Group through the grant of options over, and awards of, shares in Prudential plc.\n\nThe number of Prudential plc shares which may be issued to satisfy awards or options granted in any ten-year rolling period under (i)   these plans and any other share scheme adopted by Prudential plc and its subsidiaries may not exceed 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Prudential plc from time to time, and (ii) the Agency LTIP and the ISSOSNE to participants who qualify as 'service providers' (as defined under the Hong Kong Listing Rules) may not exceed 2 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Prudential plc from time to time. In addition, the number of Prudential plc shares which may be issued to satisfy awards or options granted in any ten-year rolling period under any scheme or plan in which Executive Directors participate or any other discretionary employee share scheme adopted by Prudential plc and its subsidiaries may not exceed 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Prudential plc and its subsidiaries from time to time. Prudential plc shares transferred out of treasury will count towards these limits for so long as this is required under institutional shareholder guidelines.\n\nAs at 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023, the shareholder dilution under (i) all share schemes adopted by Prudential plc and its subsidiaries represented 0.77 per cent and 0.52 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Prudential plc respectively (the 'Scheme Mandate'), and (ii) the Agency LTIP and the ISSOSNE represented 0.01  per cent and 0.06 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Prudential plc respectively (the 'Service Provider Sublimit').

Details of share plans held by the individual Directors have been set out separately in the Directors Remuneration Report. The five highest paid individuals during the financial year may also include Directors, if applicable.\n\n- (4) Weighted average share price is calculated based on closing share price before vesting date.\n\n## I(vii) Selected historical financial information of Prudential\n\nThe following table sets forth Prudential's selected consolidated financial data for the years indicated, which is derived from Prudential's audited consolidated financial statements. This table is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with Prudential's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.\n\n## (a) IFRS financial results\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' from 1 January 2023 as described in note A2.1 to the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the comparative results for 2022 have been re-presented from those previously published. The comparative results for 2021 to 2019 are as previously published.\n\n## 2023 and 2022 results under IFRS 17\n\n| Income statement                                                                                        | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Insurance revenue                                                                                       | 9,371     | 8,549     |\n| Insurance service expenses                                                                              | (7,113)   | (6,267)   |\n| Net expense from reinsurance contracts held                                                             | (171)     | (105)     |\n| Insurance service result                                                                                | 2,087     | 2,177     |\n| Investment return                                                                                       | 9,763     | (29,380)  |\n| Fair value movements on investment contract liabilities                                                 | (24)      | 67        |\n| Net insurance finance (expense) income                                                                  | (8,648)   | 27,430    |\n| Net investment result                                                                                   | 1,091     | (1,883)   |\n| Other revenue                                                                                           | 369       | 436       |\n| Non-insurance expenditure                                                                               | (990)     | (1,019)   |\n| Finance costs: interest on core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed businesses                | (172)     | (200)     |\n| Gain attaching to corporate transactions                                                                | (22)      | 55        |\n| Share of profits from joint ventures and associates net of related tax                                  | (91)      | (85)      |\n| Profit (loss) before tax (being tax attributable to shareholders' and policyholders' returns)  note (1) | 2,272     | (519)     |\n| Tax charges attributable to policyholders' returns                                                      | (175)     | (124)     |\n| Profit (loss) before tax attributable to shareholders' returns                                          | 2,097     | (643)     |\n| Total tax charge attributable to shareholders' and policyholders' returns                               | (560)     | (478)     |\n| Remove tax charge attributable to policyholders' returns                                                | 175       | 124       |\n| Tax charge attributable to shareholders' returns                                                        | (385)     | (354)     |\n| Profit (loss) for the year                                                                              | 1,712     | (997)     |\n| Basic earnings per share (in cents)                                                                     | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Based on profit (loss) for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company                   | 62.1\u00a2     | (36.8)\u00a2   |\n| Dividend per share (in cents)                                                                           | 2023      | 2022      |\n| Dividends paid in reporting period                                                                      | 19.30\u00a2    | 17.60\u00a2    |",

As there can only be one transition date across the Group's reporting, the Group has restated the 2022 comparative results and re-presented them above. Consequently, the 2021 to 2019 comparative results below have not been restated on an IFRS 17 basis and have been shown on an IFRS 4 basis as previously published. Therefore, the 2021 to 2019 comparative results are presented on a very different basis and are not comparable to the 2023 and 2022 results set out above. The key differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 are set out in note A2.1 to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the tables below, continuing operations reflect the Group's insurance and asset management businesses in Asia and Africa and central operations. Discontinued operations represent the Group's US business (Jackson) demerged in September 2021 and the Group's UK and Europe business (M&G) demerged in November 2019.\n\n| Income statement                                                                                   | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Continuing operations:                                                                             |           |           |           |\n| Gross premiums earned                                                                              | 24,217    | 23,495    | 23,855    |\n| Outward reinsurance premiums                                                                       | (1,844)   | (1,625)   | (1,116)   |\n| Earned premiums, net of reinsurance                                                                | 22,373    | 21,870    | 22,739    |\n| Investment return                                                                                  | 3,486     | 13,762    | 14,961    |\n| Other income                                                                                       | 641       | 615       | 639       |\n| Total revenue, net of reinsurance                                                                  | 26,500    | 36,247    | 38,339    |\n| Benefits and claims and movement in unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, net of  reinsurance | (18,911)  | (28,588)  | (29,171)  |\n| Acquisition costs and other expenditure                                                            | (4,560)   | (4,651)   | (5,908)   |\n| Finance costs: interest on core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed businesses           | (328)     | (316)     | (496)     |\n| Loss attaching to corporate transactions                                                           | (35)      | (30)      | (142)     |\n| Total charges, net of reinsurance                                                                  | (23,834)  | (33,585)  | (35,717)  |\n| Share of profits from joint ventures and associates net of related tax                             | 352       | 517       | 397       |\n| Profit before tax (being tax attributable to shareholders' and policyholders' returns)  note (1)   | 3,018     | 3,179     | 3,019     |\n| Tax charges attributable to policyholders' returns                                                 | (342)     | (271)     | (365)     |\n| Profit before tax attributable to shareholders' returns                                            | 2,676     | 2,908     | 2,654     |\n| Tax charges attributable to shareholders' returns                                                  | (462)     | (440)     | (316)     |\n| Profit from continuing operations                                                                  | 2,214     | 2,468     | 2,338     |\n| Loss from discontinued US operations                                                               | (5,027)   | (283)     | (385)     |\n| Loss from discontinued UK and Europe operations                                                    | -         | -         | (1,161)   |\n| (Loss) profit for the year                                                                         | (2,813)   | 2,185     | 792       |",

This section sets out explanations for each APM and reconciliations to relevant IFRS balances.\n\n## II(i)  Reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to profit before tax\n\nAdjusted operating profit presents the operating performance of the business. This measurement basis distinguishes adjusted operating profit from other constituents of total profit or loss for the year, including short-term fluctuations in investment returns and gain or loss on corporate transactions.\n\nMore details on how adjusted operating profit is determined are included in note B1.2 to the IFRS consolidated financial statements. A full reconciliation to profit after tax is given in note B1.1 to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\n## II(ii)  Adjusted shareholders' equity\n\nFollowing the implementation of IFRS 17, the Group has introduced a new IFRS equity measure termed 'Adjusted IFRS shareholders' equity', which is calculated by adding the IFRS 17 expected future profit (CSM) to IFRS shareholders' equity for all entities in the Group (including joint ventures and associates). Management believe this is a helpful measure that provides a reconciliation to the embedded value framework which is often used for valuations. The main difference between the Group's EEV measure and adjusted shareholders' equity is economics as explained in note II(viii).\n\n|                                                                                            | 31 Dec 2023 $m   | 31 Dec 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| IFRS shareholders' equity as reported in the financial statements                          | 17,823           | 16,731           |\n| Add: CSM, including joint ventures and associates and net of reinsurance*                  | 21,012           | 19,989           |\n| Remove: CSM asset attaching to reinsurance contracts wholly attributable to policyholders* | 1,367            | 1,295            |\n| Less: Related deferred tax adjustments for the above*                                      | (2,856)          | (2,804)          |\n| Adjusted shareholders' equity                                                              | 37,346           | 35,211           |\n\n## II(iii) Return on IFRS shareholders' equity\n\nThis measure is calculated as adjusted operating profit, after tax and non-controlling interests, divided by average IFRS shareholders' equity.\n\nDetailed reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to IFRS profit before tax for the Group is shown in note B1.1 to the Group IFRS financial results.\n\n|                                                                     | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Adjusted operating profit                                           | 2,893     | 2,722     |\n| Tax on adjusted operating profit                                    | (444)     | (539)     |\n| Adjusted operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests | (11)      | (11)      |\n| Adjusted operating profit, net of tax and non-controlling interests | 2,438     | 2,172     |\n| IFRS shareholders' equity at beginning of year                      | 16,731    | 18,936    |\n| IFRS shareholders' equity at end of year                            | 17,823    | 16,731    |\n| Average IFRS shareholders' equity                                   | 17,277    | 17,834    |\n| Operating return on average IFRS shareholders' equity (%)           | 14 %      | 12 %      |\n\n## II(iv) Calculation of shareholders' equity per share\n\nIFRS shareholders' equity per share is calculated as closing IFRS shareholders' equity divided by the number of issued shares at the end of the periods.\n\n|                                                                 | 31 Dec 2023   | 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Number of issued shares at the end of the year (million shares) | 2,754         | 2,750         |\n| Closing IFRS shareholders' equity ($ million)                   | 17,823        | 16,731        |\n| Group IFRS shareholders' equity per share (cents)               | 647\u00a2          | 608\u00a2          |\n| Closing adjusted shareholders' equity ($ million)               | 37,346        | 35,211        |\n| Group adjusted shareholders' equity per share (cents)           | 1,356\u00a2        | 1,280\u00a2        |",

Operating income and expense include the Group's share of contribution from joint ventures and associates. In the condensed consolidated income statement of the Group IFRS financial results, the net income after tax from the joint ventures and associates is shown as a single line item.\n\n## II(vi) Insurance premiums\n\nNew business sales are provided as an indicative volume measure of transactions undertaken in the reporting period that have the potential to generate profits for shareholders. The Group reports Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) new business sales as a measure of the new policies sold in the year, which is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums and one-tenth of single premiums on new business written during the year for all insurance products, including premiums for contracts designated as investment contracts and excluded from the scope of IFRS 17. The use of one-tenth of single premiums is to normalise policy premiums into the equivalent of regular annual payments. This measure is commonly used in the insurance industry to allow comparisons of the amount of new business written in a period by life insurance companies, particularly when the sales contain both single premium and regular premium business.\n\nRenewal or recurring premiums are the subsequent premiums that are paid on regular premium products. Gross premiums earned is the measure of premiums as defined under the previous IFRS 4 basis and reflects the aggregate of single and regular premiums of new business sold in the year and renewal premiums on business sold in previous years but excludes premiums for policies classified as investment contracts without discretionary participation features under IFRS, which are recorded as deposits. Gross premiums earned is no longer a metric presented under IFRS 17 and is not directly reconcilable to primary statements. The Group believes that renewal premiums and gross premiums earned are useful measures of the Group's business volumes and growth during the year.\n\n|                                                          | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross premiums earned                                    | 22,248    | 23,344    |\n| Gross premiums earned from joint ventures and associates | 3,973     | 4,439     |\n| Total Group, including joint ventures and associates     | 26,221    | 27,783    |\n| Renewal insurance premiums                               | 18,125    | 18,675    |\n| Annual premium equivalent (APE)                          | 5,876     | 4,393     |\n| Life weighted premium income                             | 24,001    | 23,068    |\n\n## II(vii) Reconciliation between EEV new business profit and IFRS new business CSM\n\n|                                                | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| EEV new business profit                        | 3,125     | 2,184     |\n| Economics and other  note (1)                  | (1,006)   | (424)     |\n| New rider sales  note (2)                      | (94)      | (66)      |\n| Related tax on IFRS new business CSM  note (3) | 323       | 370       |\n| IFRS new business CSM                          | 2,348     | 2,064     |\n\n## Notes",

Over time, the CSM balance is released into profit in the income statement as services are delivered by the Group under the insurance contracts.\n\n## Core structural borrowings\n\nBorrowings which Prudential considers forming part of its core capital structure and excludes operational borrowings.\n\n## Coverage unit\n\nThe proportion of CSM recognised in profit or loss under IFRS 17 at the end of each period for a group of contracts is determined as the ratio of the coverage units in the period divided by the sum of the coverage units in the period and the present value of expected coverage units in future periods. The total number of coverage units in a group is the quantity of service provided determined by considering the quantity of benefits for each contract and its expected coverage period.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk of loss if another party fails to meet its obligations, or fails to do so in a timely fashion.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe risk that asset or liability values, cash flows, income or expenses will be affected by changes in exchange rates.

The GWS Framework is based on a principle-based and outcome-focused approach, and allows the Hong Kong Insurance Authority to exercise direct regulatory powers over the designated holding companies of multinational insurance groups. The GWS framework sets out a measure of capital for the Group as a whole, by aggregating the capital measures of individual insurance businesses and other regulated businesses, as well as the capital resources held by Group holding companies.\n\n## H\n\n## Health and protection (H&P) products or accident and health (A&H) products\n\nThese comprise health and personal accident insurance products, which provide morbidity or sickness benefits and include health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage.

Investment risk associated with the product is usually borne by the policyholder. Insurance coverage, investment and administration services are provided for which the charges are deducted from the investment fund assets. Benefits payable will depend on the price of the units prevailing at the time of surrender, death or the maturity of the product, subject to surrender charges. These are also referred to as unit-linked products or unit-linked contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThese are measures by which the development, performance or position of the business can be measured effectively.

Examples include pure risk policies (eg fixed annuities, term insurance, critical illness) and unit-linked insurance contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nUnder IFRS 17, an insurance contract is onerous at the date of initial recognition if the fulfilment cash flows allocated to the contract, any previously recognised acquisition cash flows and any cash flows arising from the contract at the date of initial recognition in total are a net outflow.Classification as onerous does not necessarily mean the contract is not profitable overall as it does not allow for all real world investment returns that will be earned over time.\n\n## Operational borrowings\n\nBorrowings which arise in the normal course of the business, including all lease liabilities under IFRS 16.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Participating funds\n\nDistinct portfolios where the policyholders have a contractual right to receive, at the discretion of the insurer, additional benefits based on factors such as the performance of a pool of assets held within the fund, as a supplement to any guaranteed benefits. The insurer may either have discretion as to the timing of the allocation of those benefits to participating policyholders or may have discretion as to the timing and the amount of the additional benefits.\n\n## Participating policies or participating contracts\n\nContracts of insurance where the policyholders have a contractual right to receive, at the discretion of the insurer, additional benefits based on factors such as investment performance, as a supplement to any guaranteed benefits.

The risk adjustment is a component of the insurance contract liability, and it is released as profit if experience plays out as expected.\n\n## Risk-based capital (RBC) framework\n\nRBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital set by regulators as appropriate for a reporting entity to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and the level of risk it is faced. RBC limits the amount of risk a company can take and act as a cushion to protect a company from insolvency. RBC is intended to be a minimum regulatory capital standard and not necessarily the full amount of capital that an insurer would want to hold to meet its safety and competitive objectives. In addition, RBC is not designed to be used as a stand-alone tool in determining financial solvency of an insurance company; rather it is one of the tools that give regulators legal authority to take control of an insurance company.",

We would encourage all shareholders to participate in the AGM (an option to link digitally to the meeting will be provided, which will enable full participation by all shareholders). The 2024 AGM notice will provide more details on meeting arrangements and how to participate. Separately, we will offer UK-based shareholders an opportunity to meet with the Chair, CEO and management in person later in the year, at an informal event.\n\nPrudential will continue its practice of calling a poll on all resolutions and the voting results, including all proxies lodged prior to the meeting, are published on the Company's website after the meeting.\n\nShareholders were able to attend the 2023 AGM in person or digitally, where they were able to view a live video feed, submit voting instructions and ask direct questions to the Board.

There are currently no voting restrictions on the ordinary shares, all of which are fully paid, and each share carries one vote on a poll. If votes are cast on a show of hands, each shareholder present in person or by proxy, or in the case of a corporation, each of its duly authorised corporate representatives, has one vote except that if a proxy is appointed by more than one\n\nmember, the proxy has one vote for and one vote against if instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more members to vote against the resolution. Where, under an employee share plan, participants are the beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercisable by the trustee on behalf of the registered owner in accordance with the relevant plan rules. The trustees would not usually vote on any unallocated shares held in trust but they may do so at their discretion provided it would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust and permitted under the relevant trust deed.\n\nAs at 18 March 2024, the trustees held 0.38 per cent of the issued share capital under various share plans in operation. Rights to dividends under Prudential's share plans are set out on pages 200 to 225.\n\n## Restrictions on transfer\n\nIn accordance with English company law, shares may be transferred by an instrument of transfer or through an electronic system (currently CREST) and any transfer is not restricted except that the Directors may, in certain circumstances, refuse to register transfers of",

If the Directors make use of that power, they must send the transferee notice of the refusal within two months. Certain restrictions may be imposed from time to time by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, as well as under the rules of some of the Group's employee share plans.\n\nAll Directors are required to hold a minimum number of shares under guidelines approved by the Board, which they are expected to retain as described on page 218 of the Directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Authority to issue shares\n\nThe Directors require authority from shareholders in relation to the issue of shares. Whenever shares are issued, these must be offered to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings unless the Directors have been given authority by shareholders to issue shares without offering them first to existing shareholders. Prudential seeks authority from its shareholders on an annual basis to issue shares up to a maximum amount, of which a defined number may be issued without pre-emption.\n\nDisapplication of statutory pre-emption procedures is also sought for rights issues. The existing authorities to issue shares, and to do so without observing pre-emption rights, are due to expire at the end\n\nof this year's AGM. Relevant resolutions to authorise share capital issuances will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 23 May 2024.\n\nDetails of shares issued during 2023 and 2022 are given in note C8 on page 302. In accordance with the terms of a waiver granted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Prudential confirms that it complies with the applicable law and regulations in the UK in relation to the holding of shares in treasury and with the conditions of the waiver in connection with the purchase of own shares and any treasury shares it may hold.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nThe Directors also require authority from shareholders in relation to the purchase of the Company's own shares. Prudential seeks authority by special resolution on an annual basis for the buy-back of its own shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and related guidance. Under this authority, Prudential purchased 3,851,376 ordinary shares in aggregate at a volume weighted average price of \u00a38.2676 per ordinary share, for a total consideration of approximately \u00a331,841,826.52, between 8 January and 16 January 2024. All shares were cancelled.  No shares were purchased under this authority during 2023.\n\nThe authority is due to expire at the end of this year's AGM and a special resolution to renew the authority will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 23 May 2024.\n\n## Dividend information\n\n| 2023 second interim dividend   | Shareholders  registered on  the  UK register and  Hong  Kong  branch register   | Holders  of  American  Depositary   Receipts   | Shareholders  with ordinary  shares standing to  the  credit of their  CDP  securities accounts   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ex-dividend date               | 28 March 2024                                                                    | \\_                                              | 1 April 2024                                                                                      |\n| Record date                    | 2 April 2024                                                                     | 2 April 2024                                   | 2 April 2024                                                                                      |\n| Payment date                   | 16 May 2024                                                                      | 16 May 2024                                    | On or around  23 May 2024                                                                         |\n\nA number of dividend waivers are in place in respect of shares issued but not allocated under the Group's employee share plans.

The dividends waived represent less than 1 per cent of the value of dividends paid during the year.\n\n## Dividend mandates\n\nDividends are paid directly into UK based shareholders' bank or building society accounts. UK-based shareholders should contact Equiniti if they have any questions concerning the payment of dividends, or to provide their bank or building society account details. Alternatively, UK-based shareholders may download the necessary form from www.shareview.co.uk\n\nShareholders on the UK and Hong Kong registers have the option to elect to receive their dividend in US dollars instead of pounds sterling or Hong Kong dollars respectively. More information may be found on www.shareview.co.uk (UK based shareholders).\n\n## Cash dividend alternative\n\nPrudential offers a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP) to shareholders on the UK register. The DRIP is provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited ('Equiniti FS'), and is a convenient, easy and cost effective way to build a shareholding by using cash dividends to buy additional shares. Rather than having a bank account credited with a cash dividend, Equiniti FS will use the dividends payable to DRIP participants to purchase shares on their behalf in the market. Whole shares are purchased with any residual money being carried forward and added to the next dividend.\n\nHowever, if the amount of the dividend, less any dealing costs incurred in completing the purchase, is insufficient to buy a single share no charge is made and the dividend is carried forward. Further details of the DRIP are available at www.shareview.co.uk/4/Info/ Portfolio/default/en/home/shareholders/Pages/ ReinvestDividends.aspx\n\n## Electronic communications\n\nShareholders are encouraged to elect to receive corporate communications electronically. Using electronic communication will save on printing and distribution costs, and create environmental benefits.\n\nShareholders located in the UK can elect to receive corporate communications electronically by registering with Shareview at www.shareview.co.uk  Shareholders who have registered will be sent an email notification when corporate communications are available on the Company's website and a link will be provided to that information. When registering, shareholders will need their shareholder reference number which can be found on their share certificate. Please contact Equiniti if you require any assistance or further information.\n\nShareholders located in Hong Kong can elect to receive corporate communications electronically by registering with Computershare Hong Kong. Shareholders who have registered will receive an email notification  when corporate communications are available on the Company's website. Please contact Computershare Hong Kong if you require any assistance or further information.",

        "page_content": "## Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis document contains 'forward-looking statements' with respect to certain of Prudential's (and its wholly and jointly owned businesses') plans and its goals and expectations relating to future financial condition, performance, results, strategy and objectives. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Prudential's (and its wholly and jointly owned businesses') beliefs and expectations and including, without limitation, commitments, ambitions and targets, including those related to sustainability (including ESG and climate-related) matters, and statements containing the words 'may', 'will', 'should', 'continue', 'aims', 'estimates', 'projects', 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'plans', 'seeks' and 'anticipates', and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as at the time they are made, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty.\n\nA number of important factors could cause actual future financial condition or performance or other indicated results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- - current and future market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, inflation (including resulting interest rate rises), sustained high or low interest rate environments, the performance of financial and credit markets generally and the impact of economic uncertainty, slowdown or contraction (including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, conflict in the Middle East, and related or other geopolitical tensions and conflicts), which may also impact policyholder behaviour and reduce product affordability;\n- - asset valuation impacts from the transition to a lower carbon economy;\n- - derivative instruments not effectively mitigating any exposures;\n- - global political uncertainties, including the potential for increased friction in cross-border trade and the exercise of laws, regulations and executive powers to restrict trade, financial transactions, capital movements and/or investment;\n\n- the longer-term impacts of Covid-19, including macro-economic impacts on financial market volatility and global economic activity and\n\nimpacts on sales, claims (including related to treatments deferred during the pandemic), assumptions and increased product lapses;\n\n- - the policies and actions of regulatory authorities, including, in particular, the policies and actions of the Hong Kong Insurance Authority, as Prudential's Group-wide supervisor, as well as the degree and pace of regulatory changes and new government initiatives generally;\n- - the impact on Prudential of systemic risk and other group supervision policy standards adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, given Prudential's designation as an Internationally Active Insurance Group;\n- - the physical, social, morbidity/health and financial impacts of climate change and global health crises, which may impact Prudential's business, investments, operations and its duties owed to customers;\n- - legal, policy and regulatory developments in response to climate change and broader sustainability-related issues, including the development of regulations and standards and interpretations such as those relating to sustainability (including ESG and climate-related) reporting, disclosures and product labelling and their interpretations (which may conflict and create misrepresentation risks);\n- - the collective ability of governments, policymakers, the Group, industry and other stakeholders to implement and adhere to commitments on mitigation of climate change and broader sustainability-related issues effectively (including not appropriately considering the interests of all Prudential's stakeholders or failing to maintain high standards of corporate governance and responsible business practices);\n- - the impact of competition and fast-paced technological change;\n- - the effect on Prudential's business and results from mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates;\n- - the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant industries;\n- - the impact of internal transformation projects and other strategic actions failing to meet their objectives or adversely impacting the Group's operations or employees;\n- - the availability and effectiveness of reinsurance for Prudential's businesses;\n- - the risk that Prudential's operational resilience (or that of its suppliers and partners) may prove to be inadequate, including in relation to operational disruption due to external events;\n- - disruption to the availability, confidentiality or integrity of Prudential's information technology, digital systems and data (or those of its suppliers and partners) including the Pulse platform;\n- - the increased non-financial and financial risks and uncertainties associated with operating joint ventures with independent partners, particularly where joint ventures are not controlled by Prudential;\n- - the impact of changes in capital, solvency standards, accounting standards or relevant regulatory frameworks, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Prudential and its affiliates operate; and\n- - the impact of legal and regulatory actions, investigations and dispute\n\nThese factors are not exhaustive. Prudential operates in a continually changing business environment with new risks emerging from time to time that it may be unable to predict or that it currently does not expect to have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, these and other important factors may, for example, result in changes to assumptions used for determining results of operations or re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits. Further discussion of these and other important factors that could cause actual future financial condition or performance to differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in Prudential's forward-looking statements can be found under the 'Risk Factors' heading of this document.\n\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date on which they are made. Prudential expressly disclaim any obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this document or any other forward-looking statements it may make, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise except as required pursuant to the UK Prospectus Rules, the UK Listing Rules, the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the SGX-ST Listing Rules or other applicable laws and regulations.",
