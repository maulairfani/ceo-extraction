It is the reason we exist, and guides everything we do.\n\nOur vision represents where 3M is going. Our trajectory is changing as we successfully execute our strategic priorities, which is transforming our future opportunity. As a result, we are introducing a new, bolder vision for 3M: making what is indispensable to empower modern life, advance human progress, and deliver a brighter future through 3M Science. This aligns with our strengths, and will propel us forward.\n\n## Strong 2023 Performance\n\n2023 was a pivotal year for our enterprise. We strengthened our operational performance, advanced the spin-off of our health care business, and managed risk by announcing major legal agreements. We implemented the most significant restructuring in 3M history, aggressively cut management layers and simplified our supply chains - helping us deliver robust cash flow. Our market-leading businesses introduced new innovations to empower consumers, improve patient outcomes, and reshape the future of manufacturing and transportation. We also stepped up our sustainability efforts: last year alone, 3M products helped our customers avoid nearly 14 million metric tons of CO 2 emissions, which is equivalent to over 3 million gas-powered cars.\n\nMike Roman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn last year's letter, I committed to take a deeper look at everything 3M does to drive improvements. We followed through on that commitment, and exited 2023 stronger, leaner and more focused. I am proud of what we accomplished last year, and equally excited about our future. Our team remains focused on improving our performance, and delivering greater value for our customers, shareholders and all who place their trust in us.\n\nDespite macroeconomic challenges, our disciplined execution supported strong underlying margins, along with earnings and cash flow that exceeded our original guidance. In 2023 we delivered sales of $33 billion, with organic sales growth of minus 3%, reflecting softness in certain end markets such as consumer retail and electronics. We generated earnings per share of minus $12.63 - or positive $9.24 on an adjusted basis - and $6.7 billion of operating cash flow. Our strong cash flow enabled us to invest in the business, while reducing net debt and returning $3.3 billion in dividends to you, our shareholders.",

Last year, 3M initiated a restructuring to streamline the organization, reduce costs at the center and get us closer to our customers - which generated over $400 million of savings in 2023 alone. We eliminated structure and modernized our technology by removing legacy systems, while simplifying our supply chains to improve service, expand margins and increase cash conversion. We also transitioned to an export-led model in smaller countries, which enables us to reduce complexity, while still bringing 3M innovation to local customers. While we have more work to do, our actions are helping us drive operational performance and create a more competitive 3M, while freeing up resources to invest in our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur second priority is executing the spin-off of our health care business, which will result in two strong, well-capitalized and independent companies. Last year we appointed experienced leaders to the stand-alone health care business, which will be called Solventum - including Bryan Hanson as chief executive officer, Wayde McMillan as chief financial officer, and Carrie Cox as chair of the Board of Directors. The spin is on track. Related activities through February 2024 point to an anticipated completion on April 1, 2024, subject to required approvals and conditions. We are confident in the value it will create for customers, care providers, patients and shareholders.\n\nFinally, our third priority is addressing risk and uncertainty. The Combat Arms Earplug settlement announced in August of 2023 has received strong support from both claimants and the military community, and is on track to meet or exceed participation thresholds outlined in the agreement. With respect to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance), our settlement with Public Water Suppliers remains on track, and we are on schedule to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, with production volumes down 20% in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Making the Future through Material Science Innovation\n\nAs we build new platforms in our core, we are also prioritizing emerging growth opportunities in areas like climate technology, automotive electrification and industrial automation. 3M's innovative multilayer films are improving the energy efficiency of buildings, and our new partnership with Svante Technologies Inc. promises to bring carbon capture solutions to scale. We are advancing connected vehicles with an array of solutions, including new thermal barrier materials that improve the range and safety of electric car batteries - just one element of our automotive electrification platform, which grew 30% in 2023, on top of 30% growth in 2022. In addition, we offer a growing portfolio of solutions that automate manufacturing processes, including our award-winning robotic paint repair system. We now operate 10 robotics laboratories around the world, as we leverage our expertise in material science to help businesses solve worker shortages and operate with better reliability, consistency and efficiency.\n\nWe unveiled the world's first solar powered communications headset, building on our history of leadership in both safety and sustainability. Our medical solutions business announced a collaboration with the U.S. military and top universities to develop traumatic wound solutions. We launched more than a dozen consumer products, including solutions for heavy-weight hanging, part of our $500 million Command \u2122 franchise.\n\nWe also continue to apply 3M science to our sustainability goals, and are on track to meet or exceed each of our commitments around carbon, water and plastics. For example, 3M has already delivered a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to our 2019 baseline. I encourage you to read our 2024 Global Impact Report for details on our progress.\n\n3M's purpose: unlock the power of people, ideas and science to reimagine what's possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3M's innovation engine is strong. It will remain the heart of our business, and our ability to create differentiated value in the marketplace.\n\n## Positioned for Success in 2024\n\n3M is well positioned to build on our progress and deliver improving growth in 2024. We will continue to improve operational performance as we progress our restructuring, while driving even greater supply chain productivity and inventory reductions these represent significant opportunities to deliver sustainable margin and cash flow expansion this year. In addition to finalizing the health care spin, we will step up our efforts to prioritize our product portfolios based on market potential, right to win and return on investment. We will also stay focused on further reducing risk and uncertainty by managing legal matters, including finalizing pending settlements.",

        "page_content": "## Resources\n\nHuman Capital: On December 31, 2023, the Company employed approximately 85,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 34,000 employed in the United States and 51,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3M's success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.\n\n## Health and Safety:\n\n3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, training site leaders and conducting site visits to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and wellbeing through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits.\n\n## Development:\n\nDeveloping employees contributes to growing 3M's business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the Company's chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company provides leadership development experiences through job-based or project-based assignments, assessment and coaching, and targeted skill-development where leaders are given the opportunity to learn, apply, and share their skills. 3M also has prioritized learning journeys for managers and supervisors and provides opportunities for all employees to learn, in addition to regular coaching and support from their supervisor. With the Company's global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion:\n\nA diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3M has gender, race/ethnicities pay parity in all geographies, and processes in place to ensure this is maintained. Additionally, 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to increase the Company's diversity with underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates. The Company is on pace, having delivered over $39 million through 2023.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits :\n\n3M has a trust-based approach to work that empowers employees to work where and when they can best achieve their goals, which supports attraction and retention of talent around the globe. In addition to a professional and flexible work environment that promotes innovation, well-being, and rewards performance, 3M's total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company's goals with both short-term cash incentives and longterm equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.\n\nRaw Materials : In 2023, global supply chains moved towards greater balance, with disruptions driven from more isolated factors than in the prior year. Overall, 3M experienced year-over-year market inflation in 2023 driven by the carryover of 2022 impacts, and effects of a historically strong labor market. Market price risks were partially mitigated via negotiated supply contracts.",

        "page_content": "Patents, Trademarks and Licenses : The Company's products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company's research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\n\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company's business segments.\n\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance : The Company's business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability; antitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.\n\n3M's manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to 'Environmental Matters and Litigation' in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies).\n\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company's commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIn 2023, 3M expended approximately $316 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $365 million for 2024 and 2025 in aggregate.\n\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.",

The Company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company's expected future business and financial performance. Words such as 'plan,' 'expect,' 'aim,' 'believe,' 'project,' 'target,' 'anticipate,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'will,' 'should,' 'could,' \"would,\" 'forecast' and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, capital markets and other external conditions, such as interest rates, monetary policy, financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, inflation, recession, military conflicts, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers,\n- \u00b7 liabilities and the outcome of contingencies related to certain fluorochemicals known as \"PFAS,\" as well as matters related to the Company's plans to discontinue the use of PFAS,\n- \u00b7 risks related to the proposed class-action settlement ('PWS Settlement') to resolve claims by public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS, including whether court approval of the PWS Settlement will be obtained, whether the number of plaintiffs that opt out of the PWS Settlement will exceed current expectations or will exceed the level that would permit 3M to terminate the PWS Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the PWS Settlement if this occurs), whether the PWS Settlement is appealed, the timing and amount of payments made under the PWS Settlement, and the impact of the PWS Settlement on other PFAS-related matters,\n- \u00b7 the Company's strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market position,\n- \u00b7 competitive conditions and customer preferences,\n- \u00b7 foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates,\n- \u00b7 new business opportunities, product and service development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products and services,\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy,\n- \u00b7 information technology systems including implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\n- \u00b7 security breaches and other disruptions to information technology infrastructure,\n- \u00b7 the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,\n- \u00b7 operational execution, including inability to generate productivity improvements and impact of organizational restructuring activities,\n- \u00b7 future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,\n- \u00b7 future access to credit markets and the cost of credit,\n- \u00b7 pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,\n- \u00b7 asset impairments,\n- \u00b7 tax liabilities and effects of changes in tax rates, laws or regulations,\n- \u00b7 the proposed spin-off of the Company's Health Care business to establish two separate public companies,\n- \u00b7 matters relating to Combat Arms Earplugs ('CAE'), including those related to the August 2023 settlement that is intended to resolve, to the fullest extent possible, all litigation and alleged claims involving the CAE sold or manufactured by the Company's subsidiary Aearo Technologies and certain of its affiliates ('Aearo Entities') and/or 3M ('CAE Settlement'), including, but not limited to, whether the anticipated full participation by plaintiffs in the CAE Settlement will be achieved, whether the number of plaintiffs who participate in the CAE Settlement will meet the full participation expectations or will fall below the level that would permit 3M to terminate the CAE Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the CAE Settlement if this occurs), whether there will be a significant number of future claims by plaintiffs that decline to participate in the CAE Settlement, whether the CAE Settlement is appealed or challenged, the filing and outcome of additional litigation, if any, relating to the products that are the subject of the CAE Settlement, or changes in laws or regulations related to the CAE products or CAE settlement, and\n- \u00b7 laws and regulations, as well as legal compliance risks (including third-party risks), and legal and regulatory proceedings related to the same, including with regards to environmental matters and product liability, in the United States and other countries in which we operate.\n\nThe Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.",

        "page_content": "Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' under the headings of 'Overview,' 'Financial Condition and Liquidity' and annually in 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Risks Related to the Global Economy and External Conditions\n\n* The Company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.\n\nThe Company derives approximately 54 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Company's operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, terrorism, public health emergencies, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\n\nThe global economy has been impacted by military conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022 and completed a sale of the related assets in June 2023. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, higher energy and other commodity costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain.\n\nClimate change and severe weather events, including related environmental and social regulations, as well as natural disasters, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, compliance costs, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.\n\nBecause the Company's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 54 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company's results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n## Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\n- * The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\n\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as 'PFAS.' 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may require additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.",

        "page_content": "The Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company.\n\nThe PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS substances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3M. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that it would voluntarily phase out production of two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. Most of the phase out activities in the United States were completed by the end of 2002. The phase out included materials used to produce certain repellents and surfactant products, and products including Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. Following the phase out of PFOA and PFOS production, the Company has continued to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS (2022 PFAS Announcement): exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M continues to make progress toward these goals, as discussed further below. The Company recognized a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with this announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with the 2022 PFAS Announcement. In addition, the 2022 PFAS Announcement involves risks, including: the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the Company's ability to complete such exit on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to PFAS or the Company's exit plans; the Company's ability to identify and manufacture, or procure from third parties if possible, acceptable options for PFAScontaining materials in 3M's supply chain; the possibility that such non-PFAS options are not available or that such substitutes may not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial, financial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the Company's exit plans or to any products that include third-party manufactured materials containing PFAS that are incorporated into the products the Company sells; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, may not be feasible, may not be feasible on the timeframe initially predicted, or may otherwise have negative impacts on the Company's relationships with its customers and other counterparties.\n\nAs stated above, 3M is progressing toward exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. 3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M has already eliminated the PFAS use in certain product categories, and has made progress across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAScontaining products not manufactured by 3M but manufactured by companies other than 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such third-party products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate whether there may be some circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing materials manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M's product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries and printed circuit boards widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, may continue beyond 2025. In such instances, the Company intends to continue to evaluate the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible.",

        "page_content": "3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 18, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 18, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a proposed class-action settlement ('PWS Settlement') to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States regarding any PFAS, subject to court approval. If the court approves the PWS Settlement and all conditions in the PWS Settlement are met, 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement, with payments to be made from 2023 through 2036, in exchange for a release of certain claims, as described further in Note 18. The PWS Settlement gives 3M the option to terminate the PWS Settlement if the numbers of eligible class members opting out of the PWS Settlement exceed specified levels. Unexpected events related to the PWS Settlement, including whether court approval of the PWS Settlement will be obtained, whether the number of plaintiffs that opt out of the PWS Settlement will exceed current expectations or will exceed the level that would permit 3M to terminate the PWS Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the PWS Settlement if this occurs), whether the PWS Settlement is appealed, and the impact of the PWS Settlement on other PFAS-related matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or its consolidated financial position.\n\nGovernmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or its consolidated financial position.\n\nThe Company operates globally, including in some jurisdictions that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues, and is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; securities and corporate laws; antitrust and competition laws; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other antibribery, anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies; U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company's suppliers, vendors, or channel partners, or trade associations to which the Company belongs, have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M's Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements.",

        "page_content": "The failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations, and the Company has in the past and may in the future be required to pay fines or penalties related to its practices. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company's expectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the extent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation exposure, including expenses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company's reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company's intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company's activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company's reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 18, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\n\n- * The Company's results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n\nDemand for the Company's products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company's pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers' preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company's products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\n\nThis ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.",

        "page_content": "- * The Company's future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors.\n\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts and severe weather events, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. In addition, some of our suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such suppliers and the Company's ability to source adequate alternatives in a cost-effective manner. Any sustained interruption in the Company's receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites' operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to fulfill supply obligations to its customers. The Company could incur contractual penalties, experience a deterioration in customer relationships, or suffer harm to its reputation if the Company is unable to fulfill its obligations to customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n- * The Company employs information including operational technology systems to support its business and to collect, store, and/or use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of its business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the Company's information technology systems, networks and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the Company's operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the Company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the Company's business, reputation, and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state entities, and/or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Company's information and operational technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity counter measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company's information and operational technology systems, networks and infrastructure are still potentially susceptible to cyber-attack, insider threat, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities, or zero day attacks, in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses, malware or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The Company's increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the COVID-19 health pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity counter measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several months, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against these attacks. While we and third parties we utilize have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks that may lead to other disruptions of the Company's and the third parties' information and operational technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such incidents to date have had a material impact on the Company. Any cybersecurity incident or information or operational technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the Company's operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the Company's reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company's business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs, damages, expenses or losses incurred will be fully insured.",

        "page_content": "- * Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies could affect future results.\n\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions and strategic alliances, future results will be affected by, as applicable, the Company's ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies and the Company's ability to operationalize and derive anticipated benefits from alliances. Divestitures may include continued involvement in the divested businesses, such as through transitional or longer-term supply or distribution arrangements, following the transaction, and may result in unexpected liabilities through indemnification or other risk-shifting mechanisms in the applicable divestiture agreement. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company's future results.\n\nThe Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation, including restructurings from time to time, to streamline its operations, improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. Workforce restructuring activities impact business groups, functions, and geographies, and the structural reorganization is expected to reduce the size of the corporate center, simplify supply chain, streamline 3M's geographic footprint, reduce layers of management, further align business go-to-market models to customers, and reduce manufacturing roles to align with production volumes, with the goal of improving the Company's longer-term outlook in overall performance. There can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits of such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected or negative consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales; a relationship impact with employees; or a reduced ability to provide the experience that our customers, suppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company's ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M's brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Risks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n\n- * The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\n\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company's credit ratings are important to 3M's cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company's credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company's credit ratings have served to lower 3M's borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch. Since the Company's announcements of the PWS Settlement and CAE Settlements, Moody's Investor Service downgraded 3M's's credit rating twice from A1 to A3 (and downgraded 3M's short-term credit rating from P-1 to P-2). Similarly, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the Company's credit rating twice from A to BBB+ (and downgraded the Company's short-term credit rating from A-1 to A-2). The addition of further leverage to the Company's capital structure could impact 3M's credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely affect the Company's cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, interest expense could increase due to a rise in interest rates.",

In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to the Company's Aearo Entities and Combat Arms Earplug Settlement\n\n- * The Company is subject to risks related to the Company's Aearo Entities and CAE Settlement.\n\nAs previously disclosed, and as discussed further in Note 18, 'Commitments and Contingencies,' within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Aearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms - Version 2 earplugs starting in about 1999. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless faced significant litigation relating to the earplugs. In August 2023, the Company and the Aearo Entities entered into a settlement arrangement (as amended, the 'CAE Settlement') which is structured to promote participation by claimants and is intended to resolve, to the fullest extent possible, all litigation and alleged claims involving the CAE sold or manufactured by the Aearo Entities and/or 3M. Pursuant to the CAE Settlement, 3M will contribute a total amount of $6.0 billion between 2023 and 2029. The actual amount, payment terms, and dates are subject to satisfaction of certain participation thresholds claimants must meet, including that at least 98% of individuals with actual or potential litigation claims involving the CAE (calculated as described in the CAE Settlement) must have enrolled in the CAE Settlement and provided 3M with a full release of any and all claims involving the CAE. The CAE Settlement is subject to risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, whether the anticipated full participation by plaintiffs in the CAE Settlement will be achieved, whether the number of plaintiffs who participate in the CAE Settlement will meet the full participation expectations or will fall below the level that would permit 3M to terminate the CAE Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the CAE Settlement if this occurs), whether there will be a significant number of future claims by plaintiffs that decline to participate in the CAE Settlement, whether the CAE Settlement is appealed or challenged, the filing and outcome of additional litigation, if any, relating to the products that are the subject of the CAE Settlement, or changes in laws or regulations related to the CAE products or the CAE Settlement.\n\n## Risks Related to the Planned Spin-off of the Company's Health Care Business\n\n- * The Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Health Care business .\n\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, satisfactory completion of financing, final approval by the Company's Board of Directors, and other customary conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, developments or challenges involving the intended spin-off, the Company or any of its businesses, many of which are outside of the Company's control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Company's ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Company's relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties. In addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Health Care business, or the Company's stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\n\n## Item 1B.

These processes are integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems, as overseen by the Company's board of directors, primarily through its audit committee. These processes also include overseeing and identifying risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. The Company conducts security assessments of certain third-party providers before engagement and has established monitoring procedures in its effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties. The Company from time to time engages third-party consultants, legal advisors, and audit firms in evaluating and testing the Company's risk management systems and assessing and remediating certain potential cybersecurity incidents as appropriate.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe audit committee of the Company's board of directors oversees, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, including internal controls designed to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee is informed of material risks from cybersecurity threats pursuant to the escalation criteria as set forth in the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Further, at least once per quarter, the Company's Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIDO'), and/or the Company's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') reports on cybersecurity matters, including material risks and threats, to the Company's audit committee, and the audit committee provides updates to the Company's board of directors at regular board meetings. The CIDO also provides updates annually or more frequently as appropriate to the Company's board of directors.\n\n## Management\n\nUnder the oversight of the audit committee of the Company's board of directors, and as directed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the CIDO and CISO are primarily responsible for the assessment and management of material cybersecurity risks. The CIDO has more than two decades of experience with global technology organizations across multiple industries. The CISO has over 25 years of experience in information security, risk management, and compliance, has served as the chief information security officer at other organizations and, among other things, is a certified information systems security professional. The CIDO and CISO are also supported by a Cybersecurity & Privacy Executive Oversight Committee, which is comprised of certain members of senior management and is intended to provide cross-functional support for cybersecurity risk management and facilitate the response to any cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe Company's CISO oversees the Company's cybersecurity incident response plan and related processes that are designed to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO also coordinates with the Company's legal counsel and third parties, such as consultants and legal advisors, to assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes.\n\nThe Company's Disclosure Committee, with the assistance of its Cybersecurity Subcommittee, is responsible for overseeing the establishment and effectiveness of controls and other procedures, including controls and procedures related to the public disclosure of material cybersecurity matters. The Company's Disclosure Committee is comprised of, among others, the Company's Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer ('CAO'), Treasurer, Chief Legal Affairs Officer ('CLO'), Corporate Secretary, General Auditor, and the most senior members of the investor relations, external reporting, financial planning and analysis, and tax functions. The Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Company's Disclosure Committee is comprised of, among others, the Company's CAO, Treasurer, CLO, Corporate Secretary, and General Auditor, as well as the CIDO and CISO and Chief Privacy Officer.\n\nThe Company's CISO, or a delegate, informs the Disclosure Committee's Cybersecurity Subcommittee of certain cybersecurity incidents that may potentially be determined to be material pursuant to escalation criteria set forth in the Company's incident response plan and related processes. The Disclosure Committee's Cybersecurity Subcommittee is also primarily responsible for advising the Disclosure Committee and the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding cybersecurity disclosures in public filings. The CISO, with the CLO in attendance, also notifies the audit committee chair of any material cybersecurity incident.\n\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition and that are required to be reported in this Form 10-K.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M's MD&A is presented in eight sections:\n\n- \u00b7 Overview\n- \u00b7 Results of Operations\n- \u00b7 Performance by Business Segment\n- \u00b7 Performance by Geographic Area\n- \u00b7 Critical Accounting Estimates\n- \u00b7 New Accounting Pronouncements\n- \u00b7 Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- \u00b7 Financial Instruments\n\nThe term \"N/M\" used herein references \"not meaningful\" for certain percent changes.\n\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\n\nAdditional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and 2021 (including the detailed discussion of the prior year 2022 to 2021 year-over-year changes) can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Overview\n\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)) -and realignment of 3M's Consumer business segment from four divisions to three divisions. See additional information in Note 21. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes. See additional information in Note 2.\n- \u00b7 Changes to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). The Company continues to make progress on the Health Care business spinoff. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024 and is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from the 3M Board of Directors and receipt of regulatory approvals, discussed in Note 3. The completion of the spin will enable the creation of two world-class public companies well positioned to pursue their respective growth plans, tailor capital allocation strategies, and create long-term value for shareholders.\n\nFrom a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months posttransaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\n3M is impacted by certain special items such as costs for significant litigation and the sales and income associated with manufactured PFAS products. During 2023, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below) totaled approximately $15.2 billion pre-tax and included, among other things, pre-tax charges of $10.5 billion and $4.3 billion (inclusive of imputed interest) related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement (discussed in Note 18), respectively, both announced in 2023. See Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items, including references therein to where further information is provided.\n\nAdditional information regarding certain items impacting pre-2023 periods that may also be relevant in 2023 can be found in the Overview section of Part II, Item 7 as well as in further sections of 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nAs described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management records as an accrual in the Company's financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Management either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's assessment of the liabilities and disclosures related to legal proceedings.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's assessment of the liabilities related to legal proceedings, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, obtaining and evaluating contracts and agreements, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company's disclosures related to legal proceedings.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1975.",

        "page_content": "## 3M Company and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As used herein, the term '3M' or 'Company' refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements consolidate all applicable subsidiaries; intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 18.\n\nLocal currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States, with the exception of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, which are not material to 3M. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.\n\nCertain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment realigned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 21. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\n\nInvestments: 3M invests in marketable and equity securities. Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balances associated with equity securities are disclosed in Note 7.\n\n3M regularly reviews investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\n\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. These software amounts are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within PPE. Depreciation of PPE generally is computed using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 7 for depreciable life and additional details on PPE. Internal-use software elements of PPE are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of PPE and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.",

        "page_content": "Definite lived intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. These assets are amortized on a on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight-line) that is representative of the asset's use. Refer to Note 4 for amortizable life and additional details on intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within 'Research, development and related expenses'.\n\nFully depreciated PPE other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in PPE and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Definite-lived intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use.\n\nPPE and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset's (asset group's) carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nConditional Asset Retirement Obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $190 million and $177 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (namely certain tradenames), are not amortized and are assessed for impairment annually (fourth quarter and third quarter, respectively) and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level, which at 3M, corresponds to a division. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss is recognized for an indefinite-lived intangible asset when its fair value (generally determined on a discounted cash flow basis) is less than its carrying value.\n\nRestructuring Actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees' remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\n\nRevenue (Sales) Recognition: The Company sells products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M's customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\n\nRevenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company's customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).",

        "page_content": "Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes (derived from sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served). The most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\n\nThe Company applies the 'right to invoice' practical expedient based on 3M's right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3M's performance completed to date.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M's best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The Company utilizes the allowable exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less as the Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. Further, the Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.\n\nThe Company applies the practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less as the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items for potential credit losses. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\n\nAdvertising and Merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $265 million, $323 million and $327 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/ losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures.\n\nEnvironmental: Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated environmental related remediation costs are recorded when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company's commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental costs for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes .",

        "page_content": "Stock-based compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests.\n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives. See Note 16 for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs.\n\nFair Value Measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company's assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nLeases: 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used is 3M's incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\n\nRelated Party Activity: Other than amounts due by and between 3M and the Aearo Entities while the Aearo Entities were deconsolidated (as described in Note 18), 3M does not have any material related party activity.",

Refer to Note 7 for deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Approximately $520 million of the December 31, 2022 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023, while approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2021 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nOperating Lease Revenue: Net sales includes rental revenue from durable medical devices as part of operating lease arrangements (reported within the Medical Solutions Division), which was $590 million, $577 million, and $582 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively.\n\nDisaggregated Revenue Information: The Company views the following disaggregated disclosures as useful to understanding the composition of revenue recognized during the respective reporting periods:\n\n| Net Sales by Division (millions)                      | 2023      | 2022         | 2021      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|\n| Abrasives                                             | $  1,327  | $  1,343  $  | 1,296     |\n| Automotive Aftermarket                                | 1,237     | 1,209        | 1,164     |\n| Closure and Masking Systems                           | 962       | 1,046        | 1,033     |\n| Electrical Markets                                    | 1,285     | 1,304        | 1,229     |\n| Industrial Adhesives and Tapes                        | 2,164     | 2,331        | 2,353     |\n| Personal Safety                                       | 3,487     | 3,916        | 4,470     |\n| Roofing Granules                                      | 494       | 455          | 428       |\n| Other Safety and Industrial                           | -         | -            | 8         |\n| Total Safety and Industrial Business Segment          | 10,956    | 11,604       | 11,981    |\n| Advanced Materials                                    | 1,167     | 1,205        | 1,200     |\n| Automotive and Aerospace                              | 1,925     | 1,754        | 1,756     |\n| Commercial Solutions                                  | 1,723     | 1,751        | 1,717     |\n| Electronics                                           | 2,863     | 3,359        | 3,673     |\n| Transportation Safety                                 | 823       | 833          | 907       |\n| Other Transportation and Electronics                  | -         | -            | 9         |\n| Total Transportation and Electronics Business Segment | 8,501     | 8,902        | 9,262     |\n| Food Safety                                           | -         | 244          | 368       |\n| Health Information Systems                            | 1,219     | 1,259        | 1,220     |\n| Medical Solutions                                     | 4,625     | 4,581        | 4,632     |\n| Oral Care                                             | 1,329     | 1,327        | 1,396     |\n| Separation and Purification Sciences                  | 951       | 992          | 984       |\n| Other Health Care                                     | 71        | 24           | 1         |\n| Total Health Care Business Group                      | 8,195     | 8,427        | 8,601     |\n| Construction and Home Improvement Markets             | 2,221     | 2,346        | 2,465     |\n| Home, Health and Auto Care                            | 1,583     | 1,655        | 1,741     |\n| Stationery and Office                                 | 1,222     | 1,291        | 1,306     |\n| Other Consumer                                        | -         | -            | (3)       |\n| Total Consumer Business Group                         | 5,026     | 5,292        | 5,509     |\n| Corporate and Unallocated                             | 3         | 4            | 2         |\n| Total Company                                         | $  32,681 | $  34,229  $ | 35,355    |\n| Net Sales by Geographic Area (millions)               | 2023      | 2022         | 2021      |\n| Americas                                              | $  18,375 | $  18,400    | $  18,097 |\n| Asia Pacific                                          | 8,463     | 9,901        | 10,600    |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa                        | 5,843     | 5,928        | 6,660     |\n| Other Unallocated                                     | -         | -            | (2)       |\n| Worldwide                                             | $  32,681 | $            | $  35,355 |\n|                                                       |           | 34,229       |           |\n\nAmericas included United States net sales to customers of $15.1 billion, $15.0 billion and $15.0 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Divestitures\n\n2023 Divestitures and Previously Announced Divestitures: In August 2023, 3M completed the sale of assets associated with its dental local anesthetic business (part of the Health Care business) to Pierrel S.p.A. for approximately $60 million in cash. The dental local anesthetic business had annual sales of approximately $30 million. The gain on this transaction, net of a loss associated with a previous contingent indemnification obligation from a 2020 divestiture, resulted in a 2023 net pre-tax gain of $36 million.\n\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position of 19.9% in the business, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The spin-off transaction is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to customary conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, satisfactory completion of financing, and final approval by the Company's Board of Directors, among other items. 3M expects to close the transaction in the first half of 2024, subject to required conditions, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, and developments involving 3M or any of its businesses, which could delay the completion of the transaction relative to the anticipated timeline. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\n\n2022 Divestitures: In March 2022, 3M completed the sale of its floor products business in Western Europe, formerly part of the Consumer business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\n\nIn September 2022, 3M completed the split-off and combination of its Food Safety Division business (formerly part of the Health Care business segment) with Neogen Corporation in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure intended to make the split-off tax-efficient to 3M and 3M's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the transaction, 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion based on aggregate consideration of $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the underlying agreements, aggregate consideration included 3M shares exchanged and $1.0 billion ($828 million after closing and other adjustments) funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. The cash and non-cash consideration components are further described below.\n\n- \u00b7 $2 billion representing the value of 16 million 3M common shares accepted by 3M that reduced shares outstanding through a fully-subscribed exchange offer. The exchange ultimately resulted in subscribed 3M shareholders owning 50.1% of the common shares of Neogen.\n- \u00b7 $828 million in cash and non-cash components funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen.\n- \u00b7 $478 million, net of divested cash, as a cash payment to 3M funded from Food Safety business borrowings coincident with the transaction that became obligations of Neogen. This amount is reflected in the investing section on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amount was subject to closing and other adjustments and included cash paid to 3M for direct sales of certain net assets of the Food Safety business to Neogen.\n- \u00b7 $350 million as part of a non-cash debt-for-debt exchange that reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness and became new term-debt obligations of Neogen.\n\n3M determined that the split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, 3M applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Reverse Morris Trust split-off transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\n\nNet sales information relative to the Food Safety Division is included in Note 2. Neogen and 3M entered into certain limitedterm agreements related to post-divestiture transition supply, manufacturing and services and into certain longer-term commercial supply and distributor arrangements.\n\nOperating Income and Held-for-Sale Amounts: With respect to the businesses above, operating income information of the Health Care business segment, inclusive of the Food Safety Division, is included in Note 21. Information related to held for sale disposal groups is also included in Note 17.",

Restructuring Actions\n\n2023 to 2025 Structural Reorganization Actions: In 2023, 3M announced it would undertake structural reorganization actions to reduce the size of the corporate center of the Company, simplify supply chain, streamline 3M's geographic footprint, reduce layers of management, further align business go-to-market models to customers, and reduce manufacturing roles to align with production volumes. During 2023, management approved and committed to undertake associated actions impacting approximately 6,000 positions resulting in a 2023 pre-tax charge of $437 million. Remaining activities related to the restructuring actions approved and committed through December 31, 2023 under this initiative are expected to be largely completed in the first half of 2024. 3M expects to commit to further actions under this initiative. This aggregate initiative beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and continuing through 2025 is expected to impact approximately 8,500 positions worldwide with an expected pre-tax charge of $700 million to $900 million over that period.\n\nThe related restructuring charges for periods presented were recorded in the income (loss) statement as follows:\n\n| (Millions)                                   |   2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost of sales                                |    101 |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses |    304 |\n| Research, development and related expenses   |     32 |\n| Total operating income impact                |    437 |\n\nThe business segment operating income (loss) impact of these restructuring charges is summarized as follows:\n\n|                                | 2023              | 2023                     | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| (Millions)                     | Employee  Related | Asset-Related  and Other | Total  |\n| Safety and Industrial          | $  89             | $  -                     | $  89  |\n| Transportation and Electronics | 62                | -                        | 62     |\n| Health Care                    | 22                | -                        | 22     |\n| Consumer                       | 26                | -                        | 26     |\n| Corporate and unallocated      | 171               | 67                       | 238    |\n| Total operating expense        | $  370            | $  67                    | $  437 |\n\nRestructuring actions, including cash and non-cash impacts, follow:\n\n| (Millions)                                                   | Employee-Related   | Asset-Related  and Other   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------|\n| Expense incurred in 2023                                     | 370                | 67                         | 437     |\n| Non-cash changes                                             | -                  | (67)                       | (67)    |\n| Adjustments                                                  | (10)               | -                          | (10)    |\n| Cash payments                                                | (261)              | -                          | (261)   |\n| Accrued restructuring action balance as of December 31, 2023 | $  99              | $  -                       | $ 99    |\n\n2023 to 2025 PFAS Exit Actions: As further discussed in Note 18, 3M announced in 2022 that it will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. In 2023, 3M management approved and committed to undertake certain related workforce actions impacting approximately 550 positions resulting in a pre-tax charge of $64 million primarily impacting cost of sales. These charges are reflected within the Transportation and Electronics business segment. Related cash payments and adjustments to the accrued liability in 2023 were not material. The accrued restructuring action balance as of December 31, 2023 was $60 million. The remaining period of activities related to these approved and committed actions aligns with 3M's PFAS exit timeframe.",

In 2021, management approved and committed to undertake additional actions under this initiative resulting in a 2021 pre-tax charge of $124 million impacting all business segments (Corporate & Unallocated ($42 million), Safety and Industrial ($30 million), Transportation and Electronics ($24 million), Health Care ($21 million) and Consumer ($7 million)), of which $88 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In 2022, management approved and committed to undertake the remaining actions under this initiative resulting in a pre-tax charge of $18 million. The accrued restructuring action balance was $101 million at December 31, 2020, $87 million at December 31, 2021 and was completed in 2022. This initiative, beginning in 2020 and ending with 2022 actions, impacted approximately 3,100 positions worldwide with a pre-tax charge of approximately $280 million over that period.\n\n2022 Divestiture-Related Restructuring Actions: During 2022, following the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (see Note 3), management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated to the divested business. These actions affected approximately 850 positions worldwide and resulted in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $41 million primarily impacting selling, general and administrative expenses within Corporate and Unallocated. The related accrued restructuring balance as of December 31, 2022 was $10 million after associated payments during 2022.

In 2023, this was associated with the Russia exit (see Note 17) and other country exits as part of streamlining 3M's geographic footprint (see Note 5).\n- \u00b7 Defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments: amounts were reclassified into other (expense) income, net (see Note 14).\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedging instruments, unrealized gain (loss): foreign currency forward/option contacts amounts were reclassified into cost of sales; interest rate contract amounts were reclassified into interest expense (see Note 16).\n- \u00b7 The tax effects, if applicable, associated with these reclassifications were reflected in provision for income taxes.",

        "page_content": "As displayed in the table above, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has provided $706 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management's determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.\n\nThe net deferred tax assets are included as components of Other Assets and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2023, 3M's deferred tax assets, a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, also included a balance of approximately $3.6 billion as a result of the 2023 pre-tax charges related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement (both discussed in Note 18). See Note 7 'Supplemental Balance Sheet Information' for further details.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal (approximately $167 million), state (approximately $78 million), and international (approximately $65 million), with all amounts before limitation impacts and valuation allowances. Federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after one to ten years, the state after one to eleven years, and the international after one year to an indefinite carryover period.\n\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 3M's worldwide effective income tax rate is provided below:\n\nNote: A positive rate reconciliation percent for the year ended 2023 is a tax benefit on a pretax loss.\n\n|                                             | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory U.S. tax rate                     | 21.0 % | 21.0 % | 21.0 % |\n| Food Safety divestiture                     |        | (8.4)  | -      |\n| State income taxes - net of federal benefit | 3.5    | -      | 0.9    |\n| International income taxes - net            | 0.7    | (0.4)  | (1.2)  |\n| Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI)  | (0.4)  | 0.7    | 0.7    |\n| Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII)    | 1.1    | (2.3)  | (3.1)  |\n| U.S. research and development credit        | 0.6    | (1.0)  | (0.7)  |\n| Reserves for tax contingencies              | 0.5    | -      | 0.6    |\n| Employee share-based payments               |        | (0.2)  | (0.6)  |\n| All other - net                             | 0.8    | 0.2    | 0.2    |\n| Effective worldwide tax rate                | 27.8 % | 9.6 %  | 17.8 % |\n\nThe effective tax rates for 2023, 2022, and 2021 were 27.8 percent on a pre-tax loss, 9.6 percent on pre-tax income and 17.8 percent on pre-tax income, respectively. The primary factors that impacted the 2023 rate were the charges related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement (as discussed in Note 18). The primary factors that impacted the 2022 rate were the charges related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (as discussed in Note 18) and the tax efficient structure associated with the split-off of the Food Safety business (as discussed in Note 3).\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) involved a transition tax that is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 3M reflected $218 million and $380 million, respectively, in long term income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 3M reflected $189 million and $126 million, respectively, payable within one year associated with the transition tax.\n\nThe IRS completed its field examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns through 2018, but the years 2005 through 2018 have not closed as the Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax returns for the years ended 2019 and 2020. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions where the Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments, which could be impacted by evolving political environments in those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company's tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M's unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.",

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:\n\n| (Millions)                                                   | 2023   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Gross UTB Balance at January 1                               | $  927 | $  1,071 | $  1,113 |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to the current year | 11     | 115      | 91       |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior years                   | 63     | 36       | 22       |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior years                  | (53)   | (138)    | (60)     |\n| Settlements                                                  | (34)   | (118)    | (57)     |\n| Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations | (114)  | (39)     | (38)     |\n| Gross UTB Balance at December 31                             | $  800 | $  927   | $  1,071 |\n\nThe total amount of net UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $884 million as of December 31, 2023. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $76 million of expense, $1 million of expense, and $14 million of expense in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $188 million and $116 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\n\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain foreign operations in the following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2025), Switzerland (2026), Brazil (2029) and Singapore (2032). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $112 million (20 cents per diluted share) in 2023, $170 million (30 cents per diluted share) in 2022, and $204 million (36 cents per diluted share) in 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has approximately $16.1 billion of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $7.8 billion of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to repatriate these earnings to the US is immaterial. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $8.3 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.",

Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n\nThe difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company's stock-based compensation plans. Certain awards outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (36.1 million average shares for 2023, 30.3 million average shares for 2022, and 7.8 million average shares for 2021).

The maturities of long-term debt for the periods subsequent to December 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\n\n| 2024     | 2025     | 2026     | 2027   | 2028   | After 2028   | Total   |\n|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| 1,152  $ | 1,867  $ | 1,563  $ | 846  $ | 818  $ | 7,994  $     | 14,240  |\n\nAs a result of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments, long-term debt payments due in 2024 include floating rate notes totaling $53 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt).\n\nCredit Facilities: In May 2023, 3M entered into a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028; the facility was amended in July and September 2023. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender's discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The agreement replaced the amended and restated $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement and the $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility that would have expired in November 2024 and November 2023, respectively. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2023. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2023, this ratio was approximately 15 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\nOther Credit Facilities: The Company also had an additional $355 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps: During 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which has since been amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments: In 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixedrate registered notes that matured, $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured and redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022 via a make-whole-call offer.",

        "page_content": "Floating Rate Notes: At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index (noting contracts have been modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable). Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\n\n## NOTE 14. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has over 98 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant's years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. definedbenefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. In December 2023, the Company committed to the future freeze of U.S. defined benefit pension benefits for non-union U.S. employees, effective December 31, 2028 . The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n\nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care benefit plan, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\n\nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation are matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant's total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to employees' elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $241 million, $241 million and $231 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $108 million, $108 million and $117 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and aggregated to less than $25 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5% for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.98% for the U.S. pension plans and 5.06% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2023, which is a decrease of 0.20 percentage points and a decrease 0.19 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2022. A decrease in the discount rate increases the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2023 resulted in an approximately $0.2 billion increase in benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans.\n\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.50% in 2023. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's 2024 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.75%. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The 2023 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 11% global equities, 13% private equities, 63% fixed-income securities, and 13% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2023 was 10.4%. In 2022 the plan earned a rate of return of -17.4% and in 2021 earned a return of 6.7%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 7.1% and 8.0%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\n\nIn 2021 the Company updated the mortality improvement scales to the Society of Actuaries Scale MP- 2021. The December 31, 2021 update resulted in an immaterial increase to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. The Society of Actuaries did not release an update to the Scale MP-2021 in 2022 or 2023. For the December 31, 2023 annual valuation, the Company updated the plans' mortality assumption to use the Pri-2012 Mortality Table with White Collar Adjustment. The December 31, 2023 update resulted in an approximate $450 million increase to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company contributed $143 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $9 million to its postretirement plans. During 2022, the Company contributed $155 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2024, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2024. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.",

The primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\n\nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\n\nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets: In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately 83% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.",

The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 84 defined benefit plans in over 27 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.\n\nEach plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.\n\nThe fair values of the assets held by the international pension plans by asset class are as follows:\n\n|                                                       | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as    | Investments Measured                                  | Investments Measured                                  |                             |                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                       | Level 1                                               | Level 1                                               | Level 2                                               | Level 2                                               | Level 3                                               | Level 3                                               | at Net Asset Value*                                   | at Net Asset Value*                                   | Fair Value at  December 31, | Fair Value at  December 31, |\n| Asset Class (Millions)                                | 2023                                                  | 2022                                                  | 2023                                                  | 2022                                                  | 2023                                                  | 2022                                                  | 2023                                                  | 2022                                                  | 2023                        | 2022                        |\n| Equities                                              | $  226                                                | $  288                                                | $  513                                                | $  252                                                | $  1                                                  | $  2                                                  | $  45                                                 | $  1                                                  | $  785                      | $  543                      |\n| Fixed income                                          | 148                                                   | 134                                                   | 3,501                                                 | 3,542                                                 | 2                                                     | 4                                                     | 719                                                   | 623                                                   | 4,370                       | 4,303                       |\n| Private equity                                        | -

The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\n\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities. The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks and are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived input\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2023 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses increased this balance by $138 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased this balance by $6 million for a net increase of $144 million. In 2022 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $24 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased the balance by $42 million for a net decrease to this balance of $66 million.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 15. Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were approximately $270 million and $260 million, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## NOTE 16. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.\n- \u00b7 Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 17.\n- \u00b7 Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 13.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income (Loss) Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/ (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had a balance of $54 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $87 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2023 of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2023, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $26 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense.\n\nDuring 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which has since been amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nThe following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for active fair value hedges, as well as remaining amounts for discontinued fair value hedges:\n\n|                                                       |                    |                    | Cumulative Amount of Fair Value  Hedging Adjustment Included in the  Carrying Value of the Hedged  Liabilities   | Cumulative Amount of Fair Value  Hedging Adjustment Included in the  Carrying Value of the Hedged  Liabilities   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Location on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Millions) | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2023                                                                                               | December 31,  2022                                                                                               |\n| Long-term debt                                        | $  918             | $  903             | $  (84)                                                                                                          | $ (98)                                                                                                           |\n\nNet Investment Hedges: The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments to hedge portions of the Company's investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is de-designated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.\n\n3M's use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company's net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are de-designated, matured, or are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company's desired foreign exchange risk coverage.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 150 million euros, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 1.8 billion euros. The maturity dates of these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2024 to 2031.\n\nThe amount of gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in income relative to instruments designated in net investment hedge relationships is not material. The amount of pre-tax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows.\n\n|                                    | Pretax Gain (Loss) Recognized as Cumulative Translation within Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   | Pretax Gain (Loss) Recognized as Cumulative Translation within Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   | Pretax Gain (Loss) Recognized as Cumulative Translation within Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Millions)                         | 2023                                                                                               | 2022                                                                                               | 2021                                                                                               |\n| Foreign currency denominated debt  | $  (86)                                                                                            | $ 162                                                                                              | $  296                                                                                             |\n| Foreign currency forward contracts | (5)                                                                                                | 10                                                                                                 | 8                                                                                                  |\n| Total                              | $  (91)                                                                                            | $ 172                                                                                              | $ 304                                                                                              |",

In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings.

        "page_content": "Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company's risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n\n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company's consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation. For the periods presented, 3M has not received cash collateral from derivative counterparties.\n\n## Offsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n\n|                                                  | Gross Amount of Derivative  Assets Presented in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet   | Gross Amount of Derivative  Assets Presented in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet   | Gross Amount of Eligible  Offsetting Recognized   | Gross Amount of Eligible  Offsetting Recognized   | Net Amount of Derivative Assets   | Net Amount of Derivative Assets   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (Millions)                                       | December 31,  2023                                                                | December 31,  2022                                                                | December 31,  2023                                | December 31,  2022                                | December 31,  2023                | December 31,  2022                |\n| Derivatives subject to master netting agreements | $  84                                                                             | $  217                                                                            | $  30                                             | $  40                                             | $  54                             | $  177                            |\n\n## Offsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n\n|                                                  | Gross Amount of Derivative  Liabilities Presented in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet   | Gross Amount of Derivative  Liabilities Presented in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet   | Gross Amount of Eligible  Offsetting Recognized   | Gross Amount of Eligible  Offsetting Recognized   | Net Amount of Derivative  Liabilities   | Net Amount of Derivative  Liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (Millions)                                       | December 31,  2023                                                                     | December 31,  2022                                                                     | December 31,  2023                                | December 31,  2022                                | December 31,  2023                      | December 31,  2022                      |\n| Derivatives subject to master netting agreements | $  127                                                                                 | $  142                                                                                 | $  30                                             | $  40                                             | $  97                                   | $  102                                  |\n\nCurrency Effects: 3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax loss by approximately $40 million in 2023, increased pre-tax income by approximately $127 million in 2022, and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $105 million in 2021. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n\n## NOTE 17. Fair Value Measurements\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain derivative instruments. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company's financial statements on a recurring basis for 2023 and 2022.\n\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n- \u00b7 Available-for-sale marketable securities - except certain U.S. municipal securities: Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curvebased algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 12.\n- \u00b7 Available-for-sale marketable securities -certain U.S. municipal securities only : 3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2023. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method references the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation, and as such, will be classified as level 3 securities separately.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Derivative instruments : The Company's derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are required to be recorded at fair value. The Company's derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M's net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n- 3M has determined that foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M's primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\n\nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022 .\n\n|                                            |               |               | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   | Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Fair Value at | Fair Value at | Level 1                                              | Level 1                                              | Level 2                                              | Level 2                                              | Level 3                                              | Level 3                                              |\n| Description (Millions)                     | 2023          | 2022          | 2023                                                 | 2022                                                 | 2023                                                 | 2022                                                 | 2023                                                 | 2022                                                 |\n| Assets:                                    |               |               |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n| Available-for-sale:                        |               |               |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n| Marketable securities:                     |               |               |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n| Commercial paper                           | $  -

Refer to Note 14.\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis: Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments, goodwill impairments, and adjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. There were no material impairments of assets or adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for the periods presented except as described below.\n\nIn 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of net assets in Russia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $109 million, primarily within selling, general and administrative expense related to recording this held-for-sale disposal group at the lower of its fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount. In determining the carrying amount, the balance of cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be eliminated upon sale was included and contributed to the impairment charge. As of December 31, 2022 the amounts of major assets and liabilities of this held-for-sale disposal group primarily included approximately $50 million within other current liabilities that largely represented a reserve against the balance of cumulative translation adjustment. In 2023, 3M closed on the sale of these subsidiaries, resulting in an immaterial gain after reversing this reserve while reclassifying the balance of cumulative translation adjustment into earnings.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, in 2022, 3M committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in 2022, related to impairment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant, and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion). These charges were reflected within selling, general and administrative expense and goodwill impairment expense, respectively. The plan affects each of the Electronics Materials Solutions Division and Advanced Materials Division asset groupings/ reporting units (both part of the Transportation and Electronics business) with impairment resulting for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rates and other applicable items. Significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair values of the asset groupings included discount rates, which were 11% to 12%.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments : The Company's financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party's internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:\n\n|                                           | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Millions)                                | Carrying Value      | Fair Value          | Carrying Value      | Fair Value          |\n| Long-term debt, excluding current portion | $  13,088           | $  11,859           | $  14,001           | $  12,484           |\n\nThe fair values reflected in the sections above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of certain fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company's net investment in its European subsidiaries.\n\n## NOTE 18. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nWarranties/Guarantees : 3M's accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $55 million at December 31, 2023, and $48 million at December 31, 2022. Further information on product warranties is not disclosed, as the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\n\nLegal Proceedings: The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings relate to matters including, but not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal healthcare program related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act and antikickback laws, securities, and environmental laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. The Company generally responds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil, or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the Company's operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings: Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The categories of legal proceedings in which the Company is involved may include multiple lawsuits and claims, may be spread across multiple jurisdictions and courts which may handle the lawsuits and claims differently, may involve numerous and different types of plaintiffs, raising claims and legal theories based on specific allegations that may not apply to other matters, and may seek substantial compensatory and, in some cases, punitive, damages. These and other factors contribute to the complexity of these lawsuits and claims and make it difficult for the Company to predict outcomes and make reasonable estimates of any resulting losses. The Company's ability to predict outcomes and make reasonable estimates of potential losses is further influenced by the fact that a resolution of one or more matters within a category of legal proceedings may impact the resolution of other matters in that category in terms of timing, amount of liability, or both.",

        "page_content": "When making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in excess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2023, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple codefendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 4,042 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,028 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2022.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.",

        "page_content": "The Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that the filing of claims in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in sixteen of the seventeen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits -one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December -both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M's 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In 2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above, and the appeal was dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M's 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of plaintiff's mesothelioma. The plaintiff appealed the verdict. In May 2022, the First Division intermediate appellate court in Washington affirmed in part and reversed in part 3M's trial victory, concluding that the trial court misapplied Washington law in instructing the jury about factual causation. The Washington Supreme Court declined to review the matter. More recently, in November 2023, a jury in Hawaii delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 respirator was not a cause of plaintiff's mesothelioma.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. In the second half of 2020 and into 2021, the Company experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine dust; that increase represents a substantial majority of the growth in case numbers referred to above. The rate of coal mine dust-related case filings decelerated in 2022 and, in 2023, continued to stay significantly lower than in 2021. 3M moved two cases involving over 400 plaintiffs to federal court based on, among others, the Class Action Fairness Act. The federal district court remanded the cases to state court. In March 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted 3M's petition to review the remand order, and in April 2023 reversed the district court's remand order; accordingly, those cases will remain in federal court.\n\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker's compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the State's motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3M's respirators. In the first quarter of 2023, a bench trial for the unfair trade practices claims was continued indefinitely. An expert witness retained by the State has recently estimated that 3M sold over five million respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia as to key issues, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a factfinder may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.",

        "page_content": "## Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n\nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company's mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims (collectively, the 'Claims Data'). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses this analysis to develop its estimate of probable liability.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company's accrual, including the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, and the average cost of defending and resolving claims and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\n\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2023 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $57 million. In 2023, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $88 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $574 million. This accrual represents the Company's estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of (i) the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the fact that complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of liabilities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an immaterial receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/ asbestos litigation. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation -Aearo Technologies: On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies ('Aearo'). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo's respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation ('Cabot')) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silicarelated, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. In July 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation (including the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters). The U.S. Bankruptcy Court had stayed the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters during the chapter 11 proceedings. With the June 2023 dismissal of the Aearo bankruptcy that is described in the Product Liability Litigation section below, the stay of respirator mask/asbestos litigation is no longer in effect. For additional information, see the discussion within the section Product Liability Litigation with respect to Aearo Technologies Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs.",

        "page_content": "During the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings, 3M's accrual relating to the commitments associated with funding that trust included Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters. However, following the June 2023 dismissal of the Aearo bankruptcy, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $62 million as of December 31, 2023 for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation: The Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, which are enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and many for which private parties in the United States and abroad may have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damages. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury, natural resource, and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\")), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (\"PFOA\"), perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (\"PFHxS\"), perfluorobutane sulfonate (\"PFBS\"), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (\"HFPODA\") and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, \"PFAS\").",

        "page_content": "As a result of a phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their precursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of those compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of those compounds by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, precursor compounds to PFBS. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company's policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is progressing toward exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. 3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M has already eliminated the PFAS use in certain product categories and has made progress across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M but manufactured by companies other than 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such third-party products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate whether there may be some circumstances in which the use of PFAScontaining materials manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M's product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries and printed circuit boards widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, may continue beyond 2025. In such instances, the Company intends to continue to evaluate the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible.\n\n## PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\n\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, and increasingly stringent restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions and environmental media, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulatory limits for PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are being set at increasingly low levels. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, including PFAS compounds manufactured by 3M, used in current 3M products or generated as byproducts or degradation products from certain 3M production processes. If such activity continues, including as regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of regulation-related litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M's reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other environmental standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn the European Union, where 3M has PFAS manufacturing facilities in Germany and Belgium, recent regulatory activities have included various proposed and enacted restrictions of PFAS or certain PFAS compounds, including under the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\") and the EU's Persistent Organic Pollutants (\"POPs\") Regulation. PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS (and their related compounds) are listed under several Annexes of the POPs Regulation, resulting in a ban in manufacture, placing on the market and use as well as some waste management requirements of these substances in EU Member States. These substances have also been listed in the Stockholm Convention, which has been ratified by more than 180 countries and aims for global elimination of certain listed substances (with narrow exceptions). In February 2023, an EU-wide restriction on the manufacturing, use, placing on the market and import of certain perfluorocarboxylic acids (C9-C14 PFCAs), which are PFAS substances, also went into effect.\n\nWith respect to the applicability of the amendment of the EU POPs Regulation to include PFOA, which has been applicable since 2021, Dyneon, a 3M subsidiary that operates the Gendorf facility in Germany, proactively consulted with the relevant German competent authority regarding improvements necessary to meet applicable limits for a recycling process for a critical emulsifier for which small amounts of PFOA are present after recycling as an unintended contaminant. In consultation with German regulatory authorities, to achieve the applicable limits for the use of the emulsifier until the exit of PFAS manufacturing, Dyneon has started to use a method containing a mix of recycled and virgin emulsifier.",

        "page_content": "In February 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposal to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS under REACH, subject to certain proposed exceptions. In March 2023, the six-month consultation phase on the PFAS Restriction Proposal started and, in September 2023, the Company submitted comments on the proposal. Depending on the timing, scope and obligations contained in any final restriction, PFAS manufacturers and manufacturers of PFAS-containing products including 3M could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including costs of having to discontinue or modify products, future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.\n\nEffective January 2023, the EU Food Contaminants Regulation targeting four PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (\"PFNA\"), and PFHxS) in foodstuff (eggs and animal derived meat) prohibits the sale in all member states of foods containing levels of these chemicals exceeding certain regulatory thresholds. As member states implement the regulation, Dyneon, in coordination with local authorities and farmers, has proposed a pilot program of food sampling to determine if any remedial action is necessary. Sampling and further assessment of results is ongoing.\n\nThe EU regulates PFAS in drinking water via a Drinking Water Directive, which includes a limit of 0.1 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l) (or 0.1 parts per billion (ppb)) for a sum of 20 PFAS in drinking water. January 2023 was the deadline for Member States to implement the Directive in their countries. A majority of Member States have adopted the EU Directive. Some Member States, including Germany, adopted more restrictive limits for certain PFAS substances.\n\nDyneon and the predecessor operators of the Gendorf facility have commissioned a voluntary feasibility study by an independent soil consultant and shared with the competent authority the initial study including soil management concept related to the Chemical Park in which Dyneon and other companies operate their plants.\n\n3M Belgium, a subsidiary of the Company, has been working with the Public Flemish Waste Agency (\"OVAM\") for several years to investigate and remediate historical PFAS contamination at and near the 3M Belgium facility in Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, Belgium. In connection with a ring road construction project (the Oosterweel Project) in Antwerp that involved extensive soil work, an investigative committee with judicial investigatory powers was formed in June 2021 by the Flemish Parliament to investigate PFAS found in the soil and groundwater near the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium testified at Flemish parliamentary committee hearings in September and December 2021 on PFAS-related matters. As discussed in greater detail below, the Flemish Parliament, the Minister of the Environment, and regulatory authorities initiated investigations and demands for information related to the release of PFAS from the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium has cooperated with the authorities with respect to the investigations and information requests and is working with the authorities on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Safety measures -wastewater discharge:\n\nAs previously disclosed, in August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a safety measure requiring the capture of certain process wastewaters to prevent their entry into the site wastewater treatment plant. While 3M Belgium appealed the safety measure due to the belief it lacked adequate legal and factual foundation, 3M Belgium promptly implemented the required actions.\n\nIn October 2021, the Province of Antwerp unilaterally adopted lower discharge limits for the nine PFAS compounds specifically identified in the water discharge permit for the Zwijndrecht facility and added a special condition that essentially prohibits discharge of any PFAS chemistry without a specific limit in the permit. 3M Belgium received a new two-year permit in May 2022 which contained strict limits for 24 different PFAS, effective July 1, 2022. 3M Belgium installed additional control systems that it believes allows the system to meet those limits.\n\nDuring 2022, 3M Belgium identified certain short chain PFAS compounds in the wastewater from the Zwijndrecht facility and shared the results with the Inspectorate. The compounds at issue do not have specific discharge limits in the applicable wastewater discharge permit, however according to Belgian authorities a special condition in the permit prohibits detectable discharge of PFAS compounds that do not have a specific discharge limit in the permit. 3M Belgium disagrees with the Inspectorate's interpretation of the special condition and the time period during which a permit application needs to be submitted if such compounds are detected. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate regarding the discharge of certain short chain PFAS compounds in wastewater from the Zwijndrecht facility. Moreover, 3M Belgium instituted a capturing process to reduce or prevent wastewaters containing short chain PFAS identified in the infraction report from entering the treatment system or its discharge. 3M Belgium notified the Inspectorate that complying with the special condition means ceasing the legally required extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. The Inspectorate acknowledged this fact but insisted that 3M Belgium continue to extract and treat groundwater. Groundwater treatment continues, and 3M Belgium will continue its efforts to comply with the special condition and to minimize discharge of all PFAS, including the PFAS identified in the infraction report.",

        "page_content": "In February 2023, 3M Belgium applied for a modification of the water discharge permit to add parameters for certain short chain PFAS. In September 2023, the permitting authority rejected the application to add the additional short chain PFAS to 3M Belgium's discharge permit. 3M Belgium has appealed this decision and is evaluating the potential impact of this action and potential next steps. 3M Belgium cannot at this time predict the outcome of any potential appeal on discharge limits for short chain PFAS and is therefore unable to assess whether the current Zwijndrecht wastewater treatment system, or currently conceived additional treatment technology, will meet any discharge limits imposed with respect to manufacturing at the Zwijndrecht facility.\n\n## Safety measure -emissions:\n\nAs previously disclosed, in October 2021, the Flemish environmental enforcement agency issued a safety measure prohibiting, with limited exceptions, all emissions of all forms of PFAS from the facility unless specifically approved on a process-byprocess basis. 3M Belgium appealed the safety measure to the Belgian Council of State, while also complying with the safety measure by idling the affected production at the facility. The agency subsequently clarified that the safety measure applies to release of PFAS into water, and as such, reviews have been expanded as requested. In mid-2022 Flemish authorities approved the restart of key production processes. 3M Belgium continued to conduct required monitoring and reporting activities. In September 2022, the environmental enforcement agency issued an infraction report alleging that 3M Belgium had not \"fully complied\" with the safety measure in the operation of certain production lines. Those production lines were determined to require approval under the provisions of the safety measure.\n\nIn October 2022, 3M Belgium received a report from the Flemish Inspectorate regarding certain health and safety issues noted during inspections of the Zwijndrecht facility in March 2022, alleging certain related deficiencies, some dating back to 2010. In July 2023, the Environmental Inspectorate issued an infraction report stating the actions taken by 3M Belgium to address the September 2022 infraction report were insufficient to reduce dust formation from the facility. 3M Belgium implemented additional control measures to address potential dust formation and is working to outline further actions to reduce potential dust formation.\n\nAlso in the third quarter of 2023, Flemish authorities responsible for maintaining oversight of 3M Belgium's operations at the Zwijndrecht facility requested analyses of the projected cumulative impacts of continued PFAS-related manufacturing (rather than the analysis previously accepted on a process-by-process basis). In September 2023, the authorities expressed concerns based upon new information from the process identified in the September 2022 infraction report and stated their intention to investigate compliance with the safety measure further. As previously disclosed in the Company's Form 8-K, on September 22, 2023, 3M Belgium idled all PFAS manufacturing processes at the Zwijndrecht facility in response to the actions by the Flemish authorities.\n\nSubsequently, in September 2023, the Environmental Inspectorate issued an infraction report to 3M Belgium and instructed that all PFAS-related manufacturing processes at the Zwijndrecht facility be suspended until specifically approved due to emissions of certain PFAS molecules from the Zwijndrecht facility. Based on the Inspectorate's actions 3M Belgium submitted a plan to accelerate the phase out of its PFAS-related production processes at the Zwijndrecht site. In December 2023, Flemish authorities gave 3M Belgium approval to complete a PFAS-related production process for existing raw materials. In January 2024, 3M Belgium also received guidance from the relevant Flemish authorities on steps necessary to process existing quantities of intermediate and byproduct materials at the facility.\n\nA review by 3M Belgium of the underlying facts related to the manufacturing processes cited by the Environmental Inspectorate is also underway. In this same time period, the Flemish Minister of the Environment made public statements to the effect that the government will review the integrated environmental permit for the Zwijndrecht manufacturing site, which is essential for the Zwijndrecht site's overall manufacturing and processing operations. 3M Belgium has made Flemish government aware of ongoing discussions with the Flemish regulatory authorities of plans to accelerate the phase out of PFASrelated production processes at the Zwijndrecht site, and 3M Belgium has not received notice of any official action to review the integrated environmental permit for the facility.\n\nA negative development in the discussions with the Flemish authorities regarding completion of PFAS manufacturing at the Zwijndrecht facility or a negative action relating to the facility's integrated environmental permit, could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgium's normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the Zwijndrecht facility, some of which may not be available or in similar quantities from other 3M facilities.",

        "page_content": "## Soil remediation and environmental law compliance\n\nFlemish government actions and Remediation Agreement. As previously disclosed, in September 2021, the Flemish Region issued a notice of default alleging violations of environmental laws and seeking PFAS-related information, indemnity and a remediation plan for soil and water impacts due to PFAS originating from the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2021, 3M responded to the notice of default and announced a plan to invest up to \u20ac125 million over three years in actions related to the Zwijndrecht community, including support for local commercial farmers impacted by restrictions on sale of agricultural products, and enhancements to site discharge control technologies. 3M Belgium is also committed to payment for ongoing offsite descriptive soil investigation and appropriate soil remediation. In March 2022, the Company announced an investment of \u20ac150 million to advance remedial actions to address legacy PFAS previously produced at the Zwijndrecht facility.\n\nIn July 2022, 3M Belgium and the Flemish Government announced an agreement (the 'Remediation Agreement') in connection with the Zwijndrecht facility. Pursuant to the Remediation Agreement, 3M Belgium, among other things, committed an aggregate of \u20ac571 million, which includes the previous commitments described above. In aggregate, the commitment includes enhancements to site discharge control technologies, support for qualifying local farmers, amounts to address certain identified priority remedial actions (which may include supporting additional actions as required under the Flemish Soil Decree), funds to be used by the Flemish Government in its sole discretion in connection with PFAS emissions from the Zwijndrecht facility, and support for the Oosterweel Project in cash and support services. The agreement contains certain provisions ending litigation and providing certain releases of liability for 3M Belgium, while recognizing that the Flemish Government retains its authority to act in the future to protect its citizenry, as specified in the agreement. In connection with these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $500 million in the first half of 2022, with approximately $355 million in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nSoil remediation . Consistent with Flemish environmental law, descriptive soil investigations ('DSI') have been carried out to assess areas of potential PFAS contamination that may require remediation. An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has conducted several DSIs, one of which evaluated an area close to the Zwijndrecht site. That DSI was approved by Flemish authorities. The third-party soil remediation expert developed a remedial action plan ('RAP') based on the DSI for that area which was approved by the Flemish authorities.\n\nIn February 2023, OVAM rejected a DSI submitted by 3M Belgium for several additional areas near the Zwijndrecht site, required that a new DSI be submitted by the end of March 2023, and also required that 3M Belgium propose a plan to implement additional precautionary measures for individuals living in designated areas near the Zwijndrecht plant. At the end of March 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a revised DSI, along with a document identifying proposed precautionary measures that were subsequently approved by OVAM. 3M Belgium also appealed the rejection of the DSI. In May 2023, OVAM confirmed the main findings of the resubmitted DSI for certain zones and set an October 2023 deadline to submit a remedial action plan related to these zones.\n\n3M Belgium submitted two additional DSIs in May 2023 for areas around the Zwijndrecht plant, both of which were rejected by OVAM. 3M Belgium appealed the rejection of the May 2023 DSIs and also submitted a remedial master plan for approval.\n\nAlthough 3M Belgium proposed altering the October 1, 2023 deadline for the submission of certain additional DSIs and RAPs, the Flemish government informed 3M Belgium in late September 2023 that the plans were to be submitted by October 1, 2023. 3M Belgium was unable to meet the October 1, 2023 deadline, given the complexity of the issues involved and the short notice received from the Flemish government that the deadline for submission would not be extended. 3M Belgium informed the authorities that it could not meet the October 1, 2023 deadline and a new deadline was set for December 23, 2023. 3M Belgium submitted a consolidated DSI in December 2023 as required. In November, OVAM issued an administrative measure setting a RAPs submission deadline for areas adjacent to the area covered by the approved RAP for the Zwijndrecht community. 3M filed an appeal regarding one area covered by the administrative measure.\n\n3M Belgium representatives continue to have discussions with the relevant authorities regarding further soil remedial actions in connection with the Flemish Soil Decree.\n\nChanges to Flemish Soil Decree . In December 2022, the Flemish Cabinet took steps to implement an executive action (the 'Site Decision') designed to expand 3M Belgium's remedial obligations around the Zwijndrecht site. On March 31, 2023, the Site Decision was fully approved by the Flemish Cabinet and the Site Decision was published in April 2023. While the full impact of the Site Decision remains to be determined, it appears to establish a remediation zone within 5 kilometers of Zwijndrecht and may create a presently undetermined amount of additional financial and remedial obligations for 3M Belgium. In June 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the Site Decision to the Belgian Council of State. In September 2023, the Flemish government submitted its response to the petition. 3M Belgium filed its final submission responding to the Flemish government's arguments in November 2023. Various parties purporting to have an interest in the proceeding, including the government of the Netherlands, have intervened and will have the opportunity to submit arguments supporting the Site Decision.",

        "page_content": "In July 2023, the Flemish government approved a decree modifying the Flemish Soil Decree to establish a temporary action framework setting soil and groundwater values for evaluation of remediation of PFAS. While the full impact of the temporary action framework remains to be determined, its use of the values in the EU Drinking Water Directive for remediation of groundwater, regardless of whether the groundwater would be used for drinking water, may create a presently undetermined amount of additional financial and remedial obligations for 3M Belgium. In December 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the temporary action framework to the Belgian Council of State.\n\nVarious additional proposed amendments to the Flemish Soil Decree are pending, including a proposal to allow OVAM to require financial security for remediation work and a proposal to impose a percentage of the cost of remediating river sediment on various parties while requiring financial assurance for such work.\n\n## Pending or potential litigation and investigations\n\n## Litigation .\n\nBelgium. As of December 31, 2023, a total of seventeen actions against 3M Belgium are pending in Belgian civil courts. 3M Belgium has also received pre-litigation notices from individuals and entities in Belgium indicating potential claims. The pending cases include claims by individuals, municipalities, and other entities for alleged soil and wastewater or rainwater contamination with PFAS, nuisance, tort liability, personal injury and for an environmental injunction. In December 2023, 3M Belgium, 3M Company and several additional 3M entities were named in a lawsuit naming approximately 1,400 individuals as plaintiffs. The suit involves claims for defective products, liability for unlawful acts, and alleges liability of 3M entities as directors and/or shareholders of 3M Belgium, among other claims. An introductory hearing in the case is set for April 2024.\n\nWhile most of the actions are in early stages, one of the actions resulted in an award of provisional damages of 500 euros to each of four family members who live near the Zwijndrecht site, and denied other damages. Approximately 1,400 individuals have petitioned to intervene in a second \"pilot case\" alleging primarily nuisance claims. The Belgian court has not yet determined that the interventions will be permitted. An introductory hearing in the case is expected to be set for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Netherlands. In May 2023, the government of the Netherlands sent 3M Belgium a notice of liability stating it holds 3M Belgium liable for damages related to alleged PFAS contamination in the Netherlands. The notice purports to identify claims by the Dutch government and references potential damages to other parties. 3M Belgium has met, and intends to continue to meet, with representatives of the Dutch government to discuss the notice. 3M Belgium has also met with representatives of various private parties.\n\nInvestigations . As previously disclosed, the Company is aware that certain residents of Zwijndrecht and non-governmental organizations filed a criminal complaint with an Antwerp investigatory judge against 3M Belgium, alleging it had unlawfully abandoned waste in violation of its environmental care obligations, among other allegations. Certain additional parties reportedly joined the complaint. 3M Belgium has not been served with any such complaint. 3M Belgium has been cooperating with the investigation.\n\n## United States: Federal Activity\n\nIn the United States, the EPA's 'PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024' presents EPA's regulatory approach to PFAS, including investing in research to increase the understanding of PFAS, pursuing a comprehensive approach to proactively control PFAS exposures to humans and the environment, and broadening and accelerating the scope of clean-up of PFAS in the environment.\n\nWith respect to drinking water, in June 2022, EPA released final lifetime health advisory levels for PFBS (2,000 ppt) and HFPO-DA and its salts ('GenX') (4 ppt), and interim lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA (.004 ppt) and PFOS (.02 ppt). Lifetime health advisories are intended to provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. In November 2022, EPA published its final Drinking Water Contaminant Candidates List 5 (CCL 5), which includes a broad group of PFAS that are not currently subject to national primary drinking water regulations but which EPA is considering for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\").\n\nIn March 2023, EPA published proposed national primary drinking water standards for six PFAS -PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA, along with an economic analysis including purported estimated costs of the proposed rule. For PFOA and PFOS, EPA has proposed a drinking water standard of 4 ppt. For the other four PFAS, EPA proposes to adopt for the first time a drinking water standard based on a 'hazard index' approach, under which the levels of those four compounds, if detected, would be input into an EPA-provided formula to determine whether they exceed EPA's cumulative risk threshold. 3M submitted comments on EPA's proposal in May 2023. The proposed standards were sent to the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") for review in December 2023. If the proposed drinking water standards are finalized, 3M could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.",

        "page_content": "## United States: State Activity\n\nSeveral state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken various regulatory actions related to PFAS in the environment, including proposing or finalizing cleanup standards for PFAS in soil and water, groundwater standards, surface water standards, and/or drinking water standards for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS. 3M has submitted various responsive comments to these proposals.\n\nStates with finalized drinking water standards for certain PFAS include Vermont, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021 and 2022, California finalized its listing of PFOS (and its salts and transformation and degradation precursors) and PFOA as carcinogens and reproductive toxicants, and PFNA as a reproductive toxicant under its Proposition 65 law. California has also proposed listing PFDA, PFHxS, and PFUNDA as reproductive toxicants under Proposition 65.\n\nIn April 2021, 3M filed a lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (\"EGLE\") to invalidate the drinking water standards EGLE promulgated under an accelerated timeline. In November 2022, the court granted 3M's motion for summary judgment on the merits and invalidated EGLE's rule based on its failure to properly consider relevant costs. The court stayed the effect of its decision pending appeal. EGLE appealed the decision in December 2022. In August 2023, the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision that EGLE's rule was invalid. EGLE has appealed this ruling to the Michigan Supreme Court.\n\nSome states have also been evaluating or have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS compounds in products. In 2021, the State of Maine passed its Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution, which bans intentionally added PFAS in products effective January 1, 2030, and requires broad reporting of products containing intentionally-added PFAS effective January 1, 2023. In December 2022, 3M submitted to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") a list of products containing intentionally added PFAS that have been sold in the U.S. in the past two years in compliance with the law. 3M submitted an updated copy of that list to the Maine DEP in May 2023. In June 2023, Maine enacted legislation retroactive to January 1, 2023, that includes certain changes to the notification requirement in the original legislation, including an extension of the compliance date until January 2025.\n\nIn May 2023, Minnesota enacted legislation that includes a broad PFAS prohibition and reporting statute. The statute requires product notifications starting in 2025 and a general prohibition on sales of PFAS-containing products no later than 2032 for all product categories, subject to exemptions that may be adopted by rulemaking. In September 2023, MPCA opened a rulemaking to establish a program to collect the information required by the statute. MPCA also issued a request for comments, with comments due in November 2023.\n\nCertain states, including Colorado, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington have enacted restrictions on PFAS in certain categories of products, including textiles, children's products, cosmetics, and food packaging products.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, seven states have enacted laws requiring written notification of firefighting personal protective equipment that contains PFAS, with most such laws providing for potential civil penalties for non-compliance. In November 2022, the Company identified it likely did not provide required notifications for some of its products, including its Scott Safety Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses. The Company began providing written notices with those products starting November 2022. In addition, the Company continues to work to determine the extent of any potential non-compliance, has made voluntary self-disclosures to states and customers as applicable, and has expressed its willingness to work with those states to address and resolve any potential non-compliance. The Company cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by those states.\n\nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions to the Company, including to its manufacturing operations and its products. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.",

        "page_content": "## Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\n\nAs previously reported, 3M has resolved numerous claims relating to alleged PFAS contamination of properties and water supplies by 3M's Decatur, Alabama manufacturing facility. In November 2021, 3M and the City of Decatur, Decatur Utilities and Morgan County executed a collaborative agreement under which the Company agreed to contribute approximately $99 million and also to continue to address certain PFAS-related matters in the area. The contribution relates to initiatives to improve the quality of life and overall environment in Decatur, including community redevelopment and recreation projects by the City, County and Decatur Utilities. It also includes addressing certain PFAS matters at the Morgan County landfill and reimbursement of costs previously incurred related to PFAS remediation. 3M will continue to address PFAS at certain other closed municipal sites at which the Company historically disposed waste and continue environmental characterization in the area. This work will complement an Interim Consent Order that 3M entered with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management ('ADEM\") in 2020 and includes sampling of environmental media, such as ground water, regarding the potential presence of PFAS at the 3M Decatur facility and legacy disposal sites, as well as supporting the execution of appropriate remedial actions.\n\nIn August 2022, Colbert County, Alabama, which opted out of an earlier class settlement, filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River, from which the County draws its drinking water. Defendants' joint motion to dismiss was denied in December 2022, and defendants' petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court of Alabama was denied in September 2023. The case is in early stages of discovery but is currently stayed as to 3M pending final approval of the proposed public water supplier class action settlement described below.\n\nIn February 2023, the City of Muscle Shoals, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River, from which the City draws its drinking water. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in March 2023. This case has been stayed pending final approval of the proposed public water supplier class action settlement described below. Also in February 2023, two individuals who opted out of an earlier class settlement filed suit in Alabama state court against 3M, alleging PFAS contamination of their property resulting from 3M's operations in Decatur. 3M removed the case to federal court and answered the complaint in March 2023. The case is in early stages of discovery. In December 2023, several plaintiffs filed a personal injury action against 3M and other defendants, alleging exposure to PFAS from defendants' operations in Decatur.\n\n## State Attorneys General Litigation Related to PFAS\n\nAs previously reported, several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against 3M and other defendants that are now pending in a federal Multi-District Litigation (\"MDL\") court in South Carolina regarding Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), described further below. The lawsuits generally seek on a state-wide basis: injunctive relief, investigative and remedial work, compensatory damages, natural resource damages, attorneys' fees, and, where available, punitive damages related to the states' response to PFAS contamination. Currently in the AFFF MDL, state attorneys general lawsuits have been brought against 3M on behalf of the people of the states of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as on behalf of the people of the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nThere are also multiple state attorneys general lawsuits that are proceeding outside the AFFF MDL, as described below.\n\nNew Jersey. In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed two actions against 3M, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. ('DuPont'), and Chemours Co. (\"Chemours\") on behalf of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\"NJDEP\"), the NJDEP's commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges at two DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In June 2020, the court consolidated the two actions, along with two others brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities, for case management and pretrial purposes. As of March 2023, the actions are stayed pending the parties' participation in court-mandated mediation.\n\nNew Hampshire. In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state's drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The Company recently removed the other case to federal court and attempted to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this juncture in the litigation. In March 2023, the federal judge granted the state's motion to remand the case back to state court. 3M has appealed that decision and oral argument was held in October 2023.",

        "page_content": "Vermont. In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state's drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The other suit asserts PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several entities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. In late 2022, the complaint was amended to add claims related to PFBS and GenX and to add a claim under Vermont's Waste Management Act, which had been amended to add manufacturers as liable parties for the release or threatened release of hazardous materials (which in Vermont includes certain PFAS compounds). The case was removed to federal court in January 2024. Prior to the filing of that Notice, the suit was proceeding in state court, and the court had set a trial-ready date in March 2025. In October 2023, the State issued a letter to 3M and another entity requesting that an environmental investigation be conducted at the site of a facility in Rutland, Vermont that 3M owned from approximately 1955 until 1975. 3M responded to the State in November 2023.\n\nIllinois. In March 2022, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court against 3M alleging contamination of the state's natural resources by PFAS compounds disposed of by, or discharged, or emitted from 3M's Cordova plant. The complaint requests monetary damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, a testing program, and a public outreach and information sharing program. The case was removed to federal court and 3M moved to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied. In September 2023, the federal judge granted the state's motion to remand the case back to state court. 3M has appealed the remand.\n\nIn January 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a new lawsuit against 3M and other defendants in Illinois state court, alleging contamination of a number of drinking water systems and natural resource damages at several sites statewide, and seeking to recover monetary damages, injunctive relief for remediation, civil penalties and other relief. The complaint states that the Attorney General is not seeking damages for AFFF by this lawsuit. In April 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants alleging PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF. Both cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL.\n\nMaine. In March 2023, Maine's Attorney General filed two lawsuits in state court against 3M and other defendants that contain allegations related to PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF and non-AFFF products, respectively. As described above, the AFFF lawsuit was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. In July 2023, following 3M's removal of the other lawsuit to federal court, a federal district court ordered that the 'non-AFFF' lawsuit be remanded to state court. 3M is appealing the remand decision.\n\nMaryland. In May 2023, Maryland's Attorney General filed two lawsuits in state court against 3M and other defendants that contain allegations related to PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF and non-AFFF products, respectively. As described above, the AFFF lawsuit was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. 3M has also removed the 'non-AFFF' case to federal court. 3M's motion to transfer the 'non-AFFF' case to the MDL was denied and the state's motion to remand the case back to state court is pending.\n\nHawaii. In December 2023, Hawaii's Attorney General filed a lawsuit in state court against 3M and other defendants alleging PFAS contamination of state natural resources. The case was removed in January 2024 to federal court, where its transfer to the AFFF MDL is being sought.\n\nConnecticut. In January 2024, Connecticut's Attorney General filed two lawsuits in state court against 3M and other defendants that contain allegations related to PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF and non-AFFF products, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Company is in discussions with several state attorneys general and agencies, responding to information and other requests, including entering into tolling agreements, relating to PFAS matters and exploring potential resolution of some of the matters raised.\n\n## Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation\n\n3M manufactured and marketed AFFF containing certain PFAS for use in firefighting from approximately 1963 to 2002. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 6,775 lawsuits (including approximately 48 putative class actions and 678 public water system cases) alleging injuries or damages from PFAS contamination or exposure allegedly caused by AFFF use have been filed against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state and federal courts. As further described below, a vast majority of these pending cases are in a federal MDL court in South Carolina. Additional AFFF cases continue to be filed in or transferred to the MDL. Claims in the MDL are asserted by individuals, public water systems, putative class members, state and territorial sovereigns, and other entities. Plaintiffs seek a variety of relief in cases in the MDL, including, where applicable, damages for personal injury, property damage, water treatment costs, medical monitoring, natural resource damages, and punitive damages. The Company also continues to defend certain AFFF cases that remain in state court and is in discussions with pre-suit claimants for possible resolutions where appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## AFFF MDL and Water System Cases\n\nIn December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Over the past five years, the parties in the MDL have conducted substantial discovery, including ongoing master discovery and several rounds of discovery involving potential water supplier bellwether cases.\n\nIn the MDL, there are cases filed by approximately 669 public water systems (\"PWS\"). These include community water systems, which are public water systems that provide water for human use and consumption to a set population, and noncommunity water systems, which are public water systems that supply water to a varied population (for example, campgrounds or schools). There are approximately 50,000 community water systems in the United States. The MDL cases focus on AFFF, but the MDL also contains a number of cases with allegations related to the broader category of PFAS products. 3M and other defendants also face cases filed by approximately 40 public water systems outside of the MDL. Public water system cases include a variety of claims, including for product liability, negligence, and public nuisance. The cases seek damages for, among other things, remediation costs to remove PFAS from drinking water provided to communities, as well as punitive damages. The MDL court has repeatedly encouraged the parties in the MDL to negotiate to resolve cases, including these PWS cases. In October 2022, the court appointed a retired federal judge as mediator.\n\nOn June 22, 2023, 3M entered into a proposed class-action settlement to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States ('PWS Settlement'), subject to court approval. Eligible class members are United States public water systems as defined in the PWS Settlement. Subject to court approval, the PWS Settlement would resolve the portion of the MDL that involves PWS drinking water claims in the United States by providing funding for treatment technologies to eligible PWS that have tested positive for PFAS, funding for future testing, and funding for eligible systems that test positive in the future.\n\nUnder the PWS Settlement, class members would agree to release 3M from any claim arising out of, relating to, or involving (i) PFAS that has entered or may enter drinking water or the class member's water system; (ii) the development, manufacture, formulation, distribution, sale, transportation, storage, loading, mixing, application, or use of PFAS or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS; (iii) the transport, disposal, or arrangement for disposal of PFAS-containing waste or PFAS-containing wastewater, or a class member's use of PFAS-containing water for irrigation or manufacturing; or (iv) representations about PFAS or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS. The PWS Settlement would also require class members to release punitive- or exemplary-damages claims that arise out of conduct occurring at least in part before the PWS Settlement's effective date and that relate to PFAS, or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS.\n\nIf the court approves the PWS Settlement and all conditions in the PWS Settlement are met, 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023. The charge reflected the present value (discounted at an estimated 5.2% interest rate at time of proposed settlement) of the expected $12.5 billion nominal value of 3M's payments under the PWS Settlement. The PWS Settlement, as amended to include payments to the cities of Stuart, Rome and Middlesex (as discussed below), calls for 3M to make payments from 2023 through 2036. The actual amounts that 3M will pay will be determined in part by which class members that do not have a positive test result for the presence of PFAS in their drinking water (as defined by the PWS Settlement) as of the date of the PWS Settlement receive such a test result by the end of 2025.\n\nThe PWS Settlement gives 3M the option to terminate the PWS Settlement if the numbers of eligible class members opting out of the Settlement exceed specified levels. The PWS Settlement provides that 3M does not admit any liability or wrongdoing and does not waive any defenses. In August 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The deadline for eligible public water suppliers to opt out of the PWS Settlement was December 11, 2023. Plaintiffs submitted their motion in support of final approval of the settlement in December 2023 and filed their response to objections to the settlement in January 2024. The final approval hearing was held on February 2, 2024.\n\nThe previously disclosed case filed by the City of Stuart, Florida that was selected by the MDL court as the first bellwether trial was also settled in connection with the PWS Settlement. Outside the MDL, a trial was also scheduled to occur in June 2023 in a water provider lawsuit brought by the City of Rome, Georgia. 3M reached a settlement agreement to resolve the case. 3M also reached a settlement in a water provider lawsuit brought by Middlesex Water Company in New Jersey. Under the terms of the PWS Settlement, 3M's payments due under the PWS Settlement factor in amounts related to the City of Rome and Middlesex settlements.\n\nIn December 2023, the parties selected an initial set of 25 plaintiffs for potential personal injury bellwether cases. Initial discovery is ongoing in these cases. In September 2022, the court issued an order denying defendants' MDL-wide summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense, which defense can be presented to a jury at future trials.",

        "page_content": "## Other AFFF Cases\n\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL, and one case was voluntarily dismissed. The five cases that remain pending in state courts are stayed by agreement of the parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is aware of approximately 68 other AFFF suits outside the AFFF MDL in which the Company has been named a defendant. 3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, several cases are expected to remain pending in state courts, including a case in Illinois state court brought by an oil refinery worker alleging harm caused by PFAS and other chemicals.\n\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\n\nIn December 2023, a putative class action was filed against 3M Canada, 3M Company, and other defendants in British Columbia civil court on behalf of Canadian individuals alleging personal injuries from exposure to AFFF imported into Canada for firefighting and other applications. The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, disgorgement of profits, and the recovery of health care cost incurred by provincial and territorial governments.\n\n## Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n\nNumerous other PFAS-related suits naming 3M as a defendant have been filed outside the MDL in courts across the country in which 3M has been named a defendant. The Company anticipates most of the cases that relate to AFFF will ultimately be removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. However, some of these cases are likely to remain in state or federal courts outside of the MDL.\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc. (\"Wolverine\"), Georgia-Pacific LLC, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet manufacturers.\n\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers do not opt out of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn New York, 3M has settled all cases that were pending or threatened against it in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and New York state court, which alleged that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non-3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick, and Petersburgh, New York. 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell previously settled a class action (Baker), with the federal court granting final approval in February 2022. 3M, Saint-Gobain and Honeywell collectively contributed a total amount of $65 million to resolve the plaintiffs' claims on behalf of themselves and the proposed classes. Additionally, 3M is defending a case in New York state court filed by the Town of Petersburgh in September 2022. Plaintiff alleges that 3M and several other manufacturers contributed to PFOA contamination in the town's public water supply. Oral argument on a motion to dismiss that was filed by 3M and the other defendants was adjourned. This matter is stayed pending approval of the PWS Settlement. 3M is also defending 22 individual cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. 3M has filed answers in these cases, which are subject to the stay order issued pending approval of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn Michigan, a consolidated putative class action was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine. The action arose from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. 3M and Wolverine agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs, and 3M's share was not considered material. 3M's final payment related to the settlement was made in June 2023.",

        "page_content": "In Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending two state court cases brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3M's sale of PFAS-containing products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. The plaintiffs in these two water utilities cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Centre, Alabama and Rome, Georgia. In the Centre case, 3M has filed a notice of stay pending final approval of the PWS Settlement. As discussed above, the parties in Rome reached a settlement.\n\nIn April 2023, another case that included similar allegations was filed by Shelby County, Alabama, and Talladega County, Alabama, against 3M and other defendants. Those cases have been removed to federal court, where they are currently stayed as to 3M pending final approval of the PWS Settlement.\n\n3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery, which has been extended by the court through November 2023. However, the portion of the case relating to Summerville's claims has been stayed as to 3M pending final approval of the PWS Settlement.\n\nAnother case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. That case continues, with class certification and other motions recently briefed.\n\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022, which was granted in part and denied in part in February 2023. The claims that will proceed against 3M and other defendants, including negligence, wantonness, and public nuisance, are moving into discovery. However, the case is currently stayed as to 3M pending final approval of the PWS Settlement.\n\nIn Delaware, 3M is defending one putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case was removed to federal court, and in September 2022, the court dismissed all but plaintiffs' negligence claim. In November 2022, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint seeking to replead certain previously dismissed claims and, in August 2023, the court once again dismissed all but plaintiffs' negligence claim.\n\nIn New Jersey, 3M has been named a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong and Pequannock Township as water providers seeking damages for PFAS remediation. Those cases are stayed pending approval of the PWS Settlement.\n\n3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 29 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. 3M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in ten cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval. Plaintiffs in the 19 remaining individual cases allege personal injuries to themselves or to their disabled adult children.\n\n3M and Middlesex Water Company are defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November 2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFOA. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative class action brought by customers of the water company, seeking contribution and indemnity from the Company. In November 2023, Middlesex Water Company dismissed its third-party complaint against the Company in connection with the settlement of Middlesex Water Company's separate action against 3M. The parties in those two class actions are participating in the mediation process through February 2024. Discovery in the action in federal court is stayed pending the outcome of mediation. A trial date in the state court action has been set for September 2024. In March 2023, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M and Middlesex Water Company by another Middlesex Water Company customer. In May 2023, 3M filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims in that lawsuit and plaintiff subsequently amended his complaint to withdraw certain claims against 3M. The case is now proceeding in discovery.\n\nIn South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges property damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey & Lord plant from 1966 until 2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in November 2022, and 3M and DuPont filed a joint motion to dismiss, which was largely denied in September 2023.",

        "page_content": "In Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by local paper manufacturing facilities. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of Westminster. This case was removed to federal court. In February 2023, the federal court consolidated this action with a previously-filed federal case involving similar allegations and claims against 3M's co-defendants. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting claims against 3M. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in March 2023. The motion was granted in part and denied in part in December 2023. The case is expected to proceed to discovery in 2024.\n\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as defendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills. The lawsuit seeks to recover for alleged property damage. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint limiting the scope of their claims to allegations pertaining to one paper mill and three defendants that allegedly supplied PFAS-containing products to that mill, including 3M. In October 2023, the court denied 3M's motion to dismiss the case.\n\nIn Wisconsin, in August 2023, 3M and other defendants were named as defendants in a putative class action brought in federal court by several residents of Oneida County alleging property damage resulting from PFAS contamination they attribute to the operations of a paper mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. In December 2023, the JPML denied 3M's request to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a group of plaintiffs filed a complaint against 3M and other defendants in state court in December 2023 alleging personal injury, property damage, and medical monitoring claims arising from alleged water contamination from natural gas fracking and mine water discharge, which plaintiffs claim contained PFAS supplied by 3M.\n\nIn October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order 'establishing an independent panel of scientists' to evaluate PFAS. In March 2022, the court certified a class of \"[i]ndividuals subject to the laws of Ohio, who have 0.05 [ppt] of PFOA (C-8) and at least 0.05 ppt of any other PFAS in their blood serum.\" The judge ordered additional briefing to permit defendants to narrow the proposed nationwide class by 'show[ing] what states do not recognize the type of claim for relief filed by' the plaintiff. In September 2022, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants' request to appeal the district court's class certification order. In November 2023, the Sixth Circuit issued an order vacating the class certification decision and remanding the case with instructions that the district court dismiss the case. In January 2024, the Sixth Circuit denied a motion by plaintiffs for en banc rehearing of that order.\n\n## Other PFAS-related Matters\n\nAt its Greystone, Wisconsin plant where the Company conducts mining operations, the tap water available for consumption on the grounds was recently sampled and tested, and the level of certain PFAS exceeded the state's maximum contaminant level. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in October 2023 instructed the plant to notify potential drinking water users on the grounds of the plant and indicated that a notice of violation would be issued to the plant. The Company made the required notifications on October 24, 2023. On January 9, 2024, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Enforcement Conference from the Wisconsin DNR. The Company plans to meet with the DNR to discuss the appropriate next steps. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by Wisconsin DNR.\n\nThe Company continues to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants.\n\nAs previously reported, the Illinois EPA in August 2014 approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results. Effective May 2022, the Illinois EPA terminated the Cordova May 2000 Site Remediation Agreement. The Company continues to perform pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results to Illinois EPA. In addition, the Company is treating its pumped groundwater at its Cordova wastewater treatment plant.",

        "page_content": "In Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of a previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order (SACO) to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company's manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (\"HBV\") or Health Risk Limit (\"HRL\") (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the MDH to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. In January 2024, the Minnesota Department of Health issued updated, more stringent, HBVs for PFOA and PFOS. 3M is evaluating any potential impact of these developments on its obligations under the SACO.\n\nIn August 2009, the MPCA issued a decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. In the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the approved remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites, and in late 2010, 3M commenced the approved remedial option at the Oakdale site. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\n\nAs previously reported, in February 2020, the Company received an information request from EPA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Company's compliance with the Clean Water Act at its facilities that manufacture, process, and use PFAS, including the Decatur, Cordova, and Cottage Grove facilities, and the Company has completed its production of responsive documents and information.\n\nSeparately, as previously reported, in June 2020, the Company reported to EPA and MPCA that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and waste stream profile verification process of the Waste and Feedstream Analysis Plan (WAP/FAP) of its RCRA permit for its Cottage Grove incinerator. The Company and MPCA resolved the issues associated with the foregoing disclosure in a May 2022 stipulation agreement, and permanently retired the Cottage Grove hazardous waste incinerator in December 2021. In connection with the now closed incinerator, the Company in December 2022 received from EPA a draft Consent Agreement and Penalty Order under the Clean Air Act, with a proposed civil penalty to resolve issues raised in a Finding of Violation issued in 2019. The Company and EPA resolved this matter in which the Company has agreed to pay an administrative civil penalty. In October 2021, the Company received information requests from MPCA seeking additional toxicological and other information related to certain PFAS compounds. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries and is producing documents and information in response to the requests.\n\nIn June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility. The Company worked with MPCA to develop a plan to address its stormwater, which is embodied in an order issued by MPCA in December 2022.\n\nMPCA issued to the Company a Notice of Violation in March 2023, alleging that the Company is discharging stormwater containing PFAS at the 3M's facility in Hutchinson, Minnesota. The Company is working with MPCA regarding the allegations in the Notice of Violation.\n\nIn January 2024, MPCA issued a pre-publication notice of a draft Clean Water Act permit for 3M's Cottage Grove facility, with significantly revised limits on PFAS, some of which are below the limit of quantification. 3M is engaging with the MPCA and cannot at this time predict the outcome of such discussions.\n\nThe Company continues to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it conducts these reviews and responds to information, inspection, and other requests from the agencies. The Company is in negotiations with EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Alabama, Illinois and Minnesota state environmental agencies to address claims arising under the CWA and the TSCA related to the Company's plants in those states. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters, what actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies or the potential consequences to the Company.\n\n## Other Environmental Litigation\n\nIn July 2018, the Company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company's involvement in the case relates to its past use of two commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.",

        "page_content": "The Cottage Grove facility received an Alleged Violation Letter from the MPCA in November 2023 following an inspection, alleging violations relating to materials shipped in 2023 to a hazardous waste disposal facility. The Cottage Grove facility had self-reported this information to the MPCA in September 2023. In December 2023, the Company provided a written response to the MPCA detailing what the Company believes to be the completion of all of the corrective actions identified in the Alleged Violation Letter (also including waste spills and container management). At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by MPCA.\n\nIn January 2024 the Company received an information request from U.S. EPA regarding an October 2023 reported release of 1,2-propylenimine at the Cottage Grove facility. The Company is working to produce documents and information sought by this request and cooperating with this inquiry.\n\nFor environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise described below, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. The Company's environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.\n\n## Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During 2023, as a result of ongoing review and recent developments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation (including the proposed PWS Settlement), the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $10.6 billion and made related payments of $209 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded liabilities of $11.0 billion for 'other environmental liabilities.' These amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within other current liabilities ($3.0 billion) and other liabilities ($8.0 billion). The accruals represent the Company's estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related matters and litigation described above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded liabilities of $36 million for estimated non-PFAS related 'environmental remediation' costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company's commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company's current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company's operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both 'environmental remediation liabilities' and 'other environmental liabilities,' at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required postremediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.\n\nThe Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was not material. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers' purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.",

        "page_content": "## Product Liability Litigation\n\n## Combat Arms Earplugs\n\nIn December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M's Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs -Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. As previously disclosed, additional lawsuits were subsequently filed involving similar allegations.\n\nIn April 2019, the JPML granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs' summary judgment motion and denied the defendants' summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs' claims are not barred by the government contractor defense. The court denied the Company's request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to consolidate three plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021.\n\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms -Version 2 Earplugs starting in about 1999. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless, as discussed below, prior to the CAE Settlement (as defined below), the Aearo Entities and 3M faced litigation from a significant number of claimants (in the range of 260,000 to 285,000 individual claimants). As noted in the Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation -Aearo Technologie s section above, in July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters and those described in the earlier section Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation -Aearo Technologies . 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities in connection with the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund this trust and committed an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company would provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities to resolve the matter as part of the chapter 11 proceeding. Related to these actions, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M. Upon the filings in late July 2022 in the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, all litigation against Aearo Entities that filed chapter 11 cases was automatically stayed.\n\nThe Aearo Entities also requested that the Bankruptcy Court confirm that Combat Arms Earplugs litigation against the Company was also stayed or order it enjoined. In August 2022, the Bankruptcy Court denied Aearo's motion for a preliminary injunction to stay all Combat Arms related litigation against 3M. In September 2022, the bankruptcy judge certified Aearo's request to appeal the decision directly to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and in October the Seventh Circuit accepted the appeal. In December 2022, Aearo filed its opening brief with the Seventh Circuit appealing the bankruptcy court's decision. Oral argument took place in April 2023.\n\nIn February 2023, the plaintiffs filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy filings of the Aearo Entities. In June 2023, the Bankruptcy Court granted the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. As a result of this dismissal, the Court's previous stay on the Aearo Combat Arms and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation was lifted. Also in June 2023, the bankruptcy judge certified a direct appeal of the motion to dismiss decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Aearo appealed the decision and the Seventh Circuit accepted the direct appeal. Aearo's appeals of the Bankruptcy Court's preliminary injunction and motion to dismiss rulings are stayed as a result of the CAE Settlement (as defined below).\n\nAs a result of the June 2023 bankruptcy dismissal, 3M reconsolidated the former deconsolidated Aearo Entities, in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in an immaterial income statement impact. A summary of affected material consolidated balance sheet amounts is included at the end of this Combat Arms litigation discussion.\n\nRelated to the dismissal of the bankruptcy, in May 2023, the federal and state MDL courts issued orders providing that mediation would resume. In August 2023, 3M and the Aearo Entities entered into a settlement arrangement (as amended, the 'CAE Settlement') which is structured to promote participation by claimants and is intended to resolve, to the fullest extent possible, all litigation and alleged claims involving the Combat Arms Earplugs sold or manufactured by the Aearo Entities and/ or 3M, as well as potential future claims.",
