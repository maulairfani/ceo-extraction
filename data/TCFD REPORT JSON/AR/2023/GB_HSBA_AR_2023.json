        "page_content": "## Highlights\n\nFinancial performance reflected net interest income growth, and we continued to make progress against our four strategic pillars.\n\n## Financial performance (vs 2022)\n\n- -Profit before tax rose by $13.3bn to $30.3bn, primarily reflecting revenue growth. This included a favourable year-onyear impact of $2.5bn relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France, which completed on 1 January 2024, and a $1.6bn provisional gain recognised on the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited ('SVB UK') in 2023. These were partly o/ffset by the recognition of an impairment charge in 2023 of $3.0bn relating to the investment in our associate, Bank of Communications Co., Limited ('BoCom'), which followed the reassessment of our accounting valuein-use. On a constant currency basis, profit before tax increased by $13.8bn to $30.3bn. Profit after tax increased by $8.3bn to $24.6bn.\n- -Revenue rose by $15.4bn or 30% to $66.1bn, including growth in net interest income ('NII') of $5.4bn, with rises in all of our global businesses due to the higher interest rate environment. Non-interest income increased by $10.0bn, reflecting a rise in trading and fair value income of $6.4bn, mainly in Global Banking and Markets. The associated funding costs reported in NII grew by $6.2bn. The increase also included the impact of the strategic transactions referred to above, partly o/ffset by disposal losses of $1.0bn relating to repositioning and risk management activities in our hold-to-collect-and-sell portfolio.\n\n## Outlook\n\n- -We continue to target a return on average tangible equity ('RoTE') in the mid-teens for 2024, excluding the impact of notable items (see page 25 for information on our RoTE target for 2024). Our guidance reflects our current outlook for the global macroeconomic environment, including customer and financial markets activity.\n- -Based upon our current forecasts, we expect banking NII of at least $41bn for 2024. This guidance reflects our current modelling of a number of market dependent factors, including market-implied interest rates (as of mid-February 2024), as well as customer behaviour and activity levels, which we would also expect to impact our non-interest income. We do not reconcile our forward guidance on banking NII to reported NII.\n- - While our outlook for loan growth remains cautious for the first half of 2024, we continue to expect year-on-year\n- -Net interest margin ('NIM') of 1.66% increased by 24 basis points ('bps'), reflecting higher interest rates.\n- -Expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges ('ECL') were $3.4bn, a reduction of $0.1bn. The net charge in 2023 primarily comprised stage 3 charges, notably related to mainland China commercial real estate sector exposures. It also reflected continued economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. ECL were 33bps of average gross loans, including a 3bps reduction due to the inclusion of loans and advances classified as held for sale.\n- -Operating expenses fell by $0.6bn or 2% to $32.1bn, mainly due to the nonrecurrence of restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost to achieve programme at the end of 2022. This more than o/ffset higher technology costs, inflationary pressures and an increase in performance-related pay. We also incurred a higher UK bank levy and a charge relating to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') special assessment in the US.\n- Target basis operating expenses rose by 6%. This is measured on a constant currency basis, excluding notable items and the impact of the acquisition of SVB UK and related investments internationally. It also excludes the impact of retranslating the prior year results of hyperinflationary economies at constant currency.\n\ncustomer lending percentage growth in the mid-single digits over the medium to long term.\n\n- - Given continued uncertainty in the forward economic outlook, we expect ECL charges as a percentage of average gross loans to be around 40bps in 2024 (including customer lending balances transferred to held for sale). We continue to expect our ECL charges to normalise towards a range of 30bps to 40bps of average loans over the medium to long term.\n- -We retain a Group-wide focus on cost discipline. We are targeting cost growth of approximately 5% for 2024 compared with 2023, on a target basis. This target reflects our current business plan for 2024, and includes an increase in sta/ff compensation, higher technology spend and investment for growth and e/fficiency, in part mitigated by cost savings from actions taken during 2023.\n- -Customer lending balances rose by $15bn on a reported basis, but fell by $3bn on a constant currency basis. Growth included a $7.8bn reclassification of secured loans in France from held for sale, an addition of $8bn from the acquisition of SVB UK, and higher mortgage balances in HSBC UK and Hong Kong. These increases were more than o/ffset by a reduction in wholesale term lending, notably in Asia, and from business divestments in Oman and New Zealand.\n- -Customer accounts rose by $41bn on a reported basis, and $13bn on a constant currency basis, primarily in Wealth and Personal Banking, reflecting growth in Asia, partly o/ffset by reductions in HSBC UK, reflecting cost of living pressures and the competitive environment, despite an increase of $6bn from the acquisition of SVB UK. There was also a reduction due to the sale of our business in Oman.\n- -Common equity tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 14.8% rose by 0.6 percentage points, as capital generation was partly o/ffset by dividends and share buy-backs.\n- - The Board has approved a fourth interim dividend of $0.31 per share, resulting in a total for 2023 of $0.61 per share. We also intend to initiate a share buy-back of up to $2.0bn, which we expect to complete by our first quarter 2024 results announcement.\n- - Our cost target basis for 2024 excludes the impact of the disposal of our retail banking business in France and the planned disposal of our banking business in Canada from the 2023 baseline. Our cost target basis is measured on a constant currency basis and excludes notable items and the impact of retranslating the prior year results of hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. We do not reconcile our forward guidance on target basis costs to reported operating expenses.\n- -We intend to continue to manage the CET1 capital ratio within our mediumterm target range of 14% to 14.5%.\n- -Our dividend payout ratio target remains at 50% for 2024, excluding material notable items and related impacts. We have announced a further share buyback of up to $2.0bn. Further buy-backs remain subject to appropriate capital levels.",

In March, we acquired SVB UK, and subsequently launched HSBC Innovation Banking, which includes SVB UK and new teams in the US, Hong Kong and Israel, as well as in Denmark and Sweden, to deliver a globally connected, specialised banking proposition to support innovation businesses and their investors.\n- - As part of our ambition to be a leading wealth provider in Asia, we entered into an agreement to acquire Citi's retail wealth management portfolio in mainland China.

The plan includes details on our sectoral approach, and on our implementation plan to embed net zero across key areas of our organisation.\n- - Our net zero transition plan provides an overview of the progress we have made to date and what we plan to do next, although we acknowledge there is still much more to do. It will form the basis of further work on our journey to net zero over time, and we expect to review and update it periodically.\n- - Following the recent launch of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ('PCAF') accounting standard for capital markets, we have now set combined on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions targets for two emissions-intensive sectors: oil and gas, and power and utilities, and report the combined progress for both sectors. We recognise that data, methodologies and standards for measuring emissions and for target setting will continue to evolve.\n- venture focusing on embedded finance solutions and financial services applications.\n- -We continue to make good progress on our strategic disposals. The planned sale of our banking business in Canada received government approval and is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2024. We completed the sale of our retail banking operations in France on 1 January 2024, as we reshape the organisation to focus on our international customer base. In addition, we announced the planned sale of our retail business in Mauritius, and also completed the sale of our operations in Greece, the merger of HSBC Bank Oman with Sohar International, and the sale of our New Zealand retail mortgage loan portfolio.\n- - While we remain committed to the sale of our business in Russia, the sale became less\n- - Since 2020, we have provided and facilitated $294.4bn of sustainable finance and investment, which was an increase of $83.7bn in the past year. Of our sustainable finance and investment progress to 31 December 2023, $258.3bn related to green and sustainable activities and $36.1bn related to social activities.\n- -Within our own operations, we have made a 57.3% reduction in our absolute greenhouse gas emissions from a 2019 baseline.\n\n## Build inclusion and resilience\n\n- -In 2023, 34.1% of senior leadership roles were held by women. We have a target to achieve 35% by 2025, which we are on track to achieve, although we recognise that progress in the past year has not been as fast paced as we would like. We also continued to work towards meeting our ethnicity goals.\n- - We continue to make the banking experience more accessible in both physical and digital spaces. We are working to ensure that our digital channels are usable by everyone, regardless of ability. We also expanded our e/fforts to support customers with disabilities in our branch spaces.\n- certain. As a result, the business is no longer classified as held for sale, the previously recognised loss has been reversed, and a broadly o/ffsetting charge relating to recoverability was recognised in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n- -We remain committed to consider the payment of a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the proceeds from the sale of our banking business in Canada in the first half of 2024. The remaining proceeds will accrue into CET1 capital in consideration for organic growth and investment, and we intend to use any excess capital to supplement share buy-backs. Upon completion, the sale is expected to result in an initial increase in the CET1 ratio of approximately 1.2 percentage points.\n\n## Act responsibly\n\n- - We aim to be a top-three bank for customer satisfaction. In 2023, we were ranked as a top three bank against our competitors in 58% of our six key markets across Wealth and Personal Banking and Commercial Banking, but we still have work to do to improve our rank position against competitors.\n- - We published guides to help our buyers and our suppliers better understand our net zero ambitions. The guides provide further details to support suppliers in understanding our sustainability expectations, as set out in our supplier code of conduct.\n- - We continued to raise awareness and develop our understanding of our salient human rights issues. In 2023, we provided practical guidance and training, where relevant, to our colleagues across the Group, on how to identify and manage human rights risk.",

Although inflation fell globally, core inflation levels and interest rates remained elevated. There was also significant variability in growth from market to market and increased volatility within the banking sector. Our core purpose of 'opening up a world of opportunity' underlines our focus on helping our customers and clients to navigate this complexity and access growth, wherever it is.\n\nMany of our customers and colleagues are living through very di/fficult times. Higher interest rates have had a significant impact on businesses and households, and we will remain conscious of this with interest rates expected to begin to fall back in 2024. The wars between Russia and Ukraine, and now between Israel and Hamas, are absolutely devastating. Our thoughts are with all those impacted, including our colleagues in those parts of the world, and their families and friends. Their resilience, professionalism and care for one another during these most testing of times has been, and is, exceptional.\n\n## Progress and performance\n\nTurning to our performance, I want to again pay tribute to my colleagues. The record profit performance that we delivered in 2023 was supported by the impact of interest rates on our strong balance sheet, but it was also testament to the tireless e/fforts of our people around the world. I would like to thank them sincerely for their hard work, dedication and commitment to serving our customers.\n\nIn 2023, reported profit before tax was $30.3bn, which was an increase of $13.3bn compared with 2022. This was due mainly to higher revenue and a number of notable items. Our three global businesses delivered good revenue growth, and we ended the year with strong capital, funding and liquidity positions.\n\nWe remain committed to sharing the benefits of our improved performance with our shareholders. The Board approved a fourth quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, bringing the total dividend for 2023 to $0.61 per share. Furthermore, in 2023 we announced three share buy-backs worth a total of $7bn and, today, have announced a further share buyback of up to $2bn.\n\nThe planned sale of our banking operations in Canada received final approval from the Canadian government at the end of last year. Subject to completion of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of 2024, the Board will consider a special dividend of $0.21 per share, to be paid in the first half of 2024, as a priority use of the proceeds.\n\nWith this anticipated transaction and the completion of the sale of our retail banking business in France last month, our focus has moved to investing for growth, while maintaining e/fficiency. Two examples of growth opportunities last year were the agreed acquisition of Citi's retail wealth business in mainland China, which will help accelerate our Wealth strategy, and the acquisition of SVB UK, following the di/fficulties experienced by its US parent entity. Acquiring SVB UK was opportunistic, but the deal made excellent strategic sense for HSBC, and it also helped to protect clients, safeguard jobs and maintain financial stability.\n\nTechnology and sustainability are two of the trends transforming banking and the world around us. The opportunities from generative AI are among the most transformative within my working life. We are actively exploring a number of use cases, while also working to manage the associated risks.\n\nMeanwhile the global climate challenge is becoming increasingly acute. Our presence in many of the sectors and markets where the need to reduce emissions is the greatest provides us with an opportunity to work with our clients to help address it. This is set out in our first net zero transition plan. The Board discussed and contributed to the net zero transition plan in depth. We believe that it is a realistic and ambitious assessment of the long-term journey ahead, as we continue to work with our clients on their transitions to a low-carbon future. It is clear there will be many uncertainties and dependencies, and that our approach will need to continue to evolve with the real world around us.",

Ahead of that, Noel and I were pleased to meet with Hong Kong shareholders at our Informal Shareholders' Meeting. At both meetings, we also discussed the resolutions that were requisitioned by shareholders on the Group's strategy and dividend policy. Shareholders expressed strong support for the Group's current strategy by voting overwhelmingly with the Board and against these resolutions at the AGM. This enabled the Board, my colleagues and our shareholders to focus on our shared objectives of serving our customers, driving stronger performance, and creating more value for our investors.\n\nIn 2023, the Board held meetings in London, Birmingham, Hong Kong, Paris, New York, Mumbai and Delhi. We also returned to Beijing and Shanghai last month. On each occasion, the Board engaged with clients, colleagues, government o/fficials and regulators - with these discussions underlining that HSBC continues to have a key role connecting the world's trade and finance hubs.\n\nThere were a number of changes to the composition of the Board last year. At the 2023 AGM, we said farewell to Jackson Tai, who made an important, extensive and lasting contribution to the success of HSBC during his time as a non-executive Director. His leadership in strengthening risk and conduct governance and oversight was particularly critical through a period of significant change.\n\nWe also announced in December that David Nish intends to retire from the Board at the 2024 AGM. David has made an invaluable contribution to the Board over the past eight years, particularly in recent years as Chair of the Group Audit Committee and as Senior Independent Director. I would like to thank him warmly for his consistent counsel and guidance.\n\nI am pleased that Kalpana Morparia, Ann Godbehere, Brendan Nelson and Swee Lian Teo joined the Board during 2023. Each of them brings experience and expertise that is an asset to the Board. Specifically, Ann's extensive public-listed company board experience means that she is ideally placed to take over as Senior Independent Director, while Brendan's UK and international financial expertise and significant experience as audit chair at UK-listed companies will be particularly valuable as he takes over leadership of the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Macroeconomic outlook\n\nLooking ahead, 2024 is likely to be another eventful year. The slowing of inflation in the second half of 2023 means that monetary tightening now appears to be coming to an end. However, current inflation levels in many economies remain above their targets. As central banks continue to try to bridge this gap, voters head to the polls in a significant number of countries across the globe. The timing and outcomes of these elections will impact the decision making of governments and have geopolitical, as well as fiscal, implications. We will monitor the results closely, and take a long-term view of strategy, purpose and capital allocation, while cognisant of any short-term challenges.\n\nAmong these potential challenges are the increased uncertainties due to wars in Europe and the Middle East, and disruption to global trade and supply chains caused by these and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. However, we remain cautiously optimistic about economic prospects for 2024. We expect growth to slow in the first half of the year and recover thereafter. We also expect the variable economic growth that has characterised recent years to continue.\n\nChina's recovery after reopening was bumpier than expected, but its economy grew in line with its annual target of around 5% in 2023. We expect this to be maintained in 2024, with recently announced policy measures to support the property sector and local government debt gradually flowing through to the wider economy. Hong Kong's growth has moved along at a slower but healthy pace and is likely to remain in line with pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAs Asia continues to grow, a significant opportunity is emerging to connect it to another high-growth region. The Middle East region performed very well economically in 2023 and the outlook remains strong for 2024, notwithstanding the risks arising from conflicts in the region. As countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to diversify their economies, new opportunities are created to connect them to Asia, and Asia to them.\n\nThe US economy grew more quickly than expected in 2023 in the face of higher interest rates. Growth is likely to be lower in 2024, although it should remain higher than in Europe where growth remains subdued. The UK economy, which entered a technical recession at the end of 2023, has nonetheless been resilient. Headline inflation should fall in the first half of the year, with core inflation following by the end of 2024. This will of course determine the pace of interest rate cuts.\n\nI would like to end by reiterating my thanks to my colleagues for all that they have done, and all that they continue to do, for HSBC. Their tireless e/fforts are reflected by our improved financial performance and increased returns for shareholders in 2023 - and I look forward to them securing the foundations for our future success.\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\n21 February 2024\n\nThe economies of south and south-east Asia carry good economic momentum into 2024. India and Vietnam are currently among the fastest-growing economies in the world, benefiting from competitive labour costs, supportive policies and changing supply chains. Chinese companies are among those increasingly looking towards these and other markets, as China's economic transformation towards high-quality growth and domestic consumption continues.",

I would like to start by paying tribute to my colleagues for all that they did last year, and in the preceding three years. As I have said before, they have fully embraced our core purpose of 'opening up a world of opportunity' in all they do -from helping clients and customers to expand to new markets or move overseas, to digitising our business and helping our people to be their best, to our ongoing work on the transition to net zero.\n\nOur performance last year was great credit to them. We delivered strong revenue growth across all three global businesses, supported by higher interest rates, which enabled us to deliver our best return on average tangible equity in more than a decade. As well as improving financial performance, our strategy is increasing shareholder returns. I am pleased that we have rewarded our shareholders for their loyalty with the highest full-year dividend per share since 2008, as well as three share buy-backs in 2023 totalling $7bn. In total, we returned $19bn to shareholders by way of dividend and share buy-backs in respect of 2023. In addition, we have today announced a further share buy-back of up to $2bn.\n\nAs we move into 2024, I am confident that there are opportunities ahead for us and our clients that can help us to sustain our good performance going into the next phase of the interest rate cycle.\n\nThe environment does, however, remain challenging. The wars in Europe and the Middle East are beyond comprehension on a human level, and my thoughts remain with all those impacted. Both conflicts also still have the potential to escalate further. That would first and foremost deepen the humanitarian crisis, but also likely lead to another wave of market and economic turmoil. Interest rates are expected to fall this year, which we believe should in turn help to increase economic activity. The outlook currently remains uncertain, however, and many of our customers remain concerned about their finances. In the midst of these challenges, we will stay focused on what we are here to do - which is to serve our customers and clients, and help them with any financial di/fficulties they face.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur results are a testament to the way we stayed focused in 2023. Reported profit before tax was $30.3bn, which was $13.3bn higher than in 2022. This included a number of notable items, including a favourable year-on-year impact of $2.5bn relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and a $1.6bn provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. These were o/ffset by a valuation adjustment of $3.0bn relating to our investment in BoCom, which followed the reassessment of our accounting value-inuse in line with recent market developments in mainland China. This adjustment has no material impact on our capital, capital ratio and distribution capacity, and therefore no impact on our share buy-backs or dividends. We remain confident in the resilience of the Chinese economy, and the growth opportunities in mainland China over the medium to long term.\n\nReported revenue grew by 30% or $15.4bn, driven by an increase in net interest income of $5.4bn from all three global businesses. Noninterest income increased by $10bn, reflecting increased trading and fair value income of $6.4bn, mainly in Global Banking and Markets, and the favourable year-on-year impact from the impairment relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK.\n\nIn 2023, we delivered a return on average tangible equity of 14.6%, or 15.6% excluding strategic transactions and the impairment on our investment in BoCom.",

        "page_content": "' I am confident that there are opportunities ahead for us and our clients that can help us to sustain our good performance going into the next phase of the interest rate cycle.'\n\nOur three global businesses performed well. In Commercial Banking, profit before tax was up by 76% to $13.3bn on a constant currency basis, driven by revenue increases across all our main legal entities. Within this, Global Payments Solutions revenue increased by 78% or $5.4bn on a constant currency basis, driven by higher margins reflecting higher interest rates and repricing. Fee income increased by 4% due to growth in transaction banking and higher volumes in cards and international payments, while our trade business performed well relative to the market and we increased our market share.\n\nGlobal Banking and Markets delivered profit before tax of $5.9bn, up 26% compared with 2022, on a constant currency basis. Revenue grew by 10% on a constant currency basis, due to higher net interest income in Global Payments Solutions and Securities Services. In Wealth and Personal Banking, profit before tax of $11.5bn was $6.1bn higher than in 2022, on a constant currency basis. Revenue was up by 31% or $6.4bn on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Personal Banking and in Wealth, as well as the positive year-on-year impact relating to the sale of our French retail banking business. Within this, Wealth revenue of $7.5bn was up 8% or $0.6bn on a constant currency basis, with good growth in private banking and asset management.\n\nReported costs for 2023 were down by 2% compared with the previous year, as lower restructuring costs o/ffset higher technology spending, inflation, higher performancerelated pay and levies. On a target basis, costs increased by 6%, which was 1% higher than previously guided due to levies including a charge relating to the FDIC special assessment levy in the US. Our reported cost-e/fficiency ratio improved to 48.5% from 64.6% in 2022, supported by higher net interest income.\n\nOur 2023 reported ECL charge of $3.4bn was $0.1bn lower than in 2022. This primarily comprised stage 3 net charges, notably related to mainland China commercial real estate sector exposures, and reflected the continued uncertainty within the global economy. After good capital generation in 2023, we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 14.8%. We are able to pay a fourth interim dividend of $0.31 per share, bringing the total 2023 dividend to $0.61 per share, which is the highest since 2008.\n\n## From transform to sustain and grow\n\nLooking forward, supportive interest rates and good underlying business growth have given us strong momentum. We continue to target a mid-teens return on average tangible equity. We are also, however, mindful of the interest rate cycle and the subsequent impact on net interest income. In 2023, we increased the size and duration of our structural hedges to reduce the sensitivity of banking net interest income to interest rate movements and help stabilise future earnings. We also see a number of growth opportunities within our strategy that play to our strengths.\n\nThe first is to further grow our international businesses, which remains our biggest di/fferentiator and growth opportunity. International expansion remains a core strategy for corporates and institutions seeking to develop and expand, especially the mid-market corporates that HSBC is very well-positioned to serve. Rather than de-globalising, we are seeing the world re-globalise, as supply chains change and intra-regional trade flows increase. Our international network and presence in markets that are benefiting like the ASEAN region and Mexico help us to capitalise on these trends. As a result, our market-leading trade franchise facilitated more than $850bn of trade in 2023, while we are the second biggest payments company by revenue and we processed around $500tn of payments electronically in 2023. This helped to grow wholesale multijurisdictional client revenue from customers who bank with us in more than one market, by 29% in 2023. With multi-jurisdictional corporate customers in Commercial Banking generating around five times as much client revenue as an average domestic customer, we continue to focus on growing this further, especially in the mid-market segment where we have a competitive advantage and there is still potential to further extend our market leadership.\n\nThe second is to diversify our revenue. Building our wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services, especially in Asia, has been a strategic priority. Last year, we attracted net new invested assets of $84bn, following $80bn in 2022 and $64bn in 2021, underlining the traction that we have gained. Our agreement to acquire Citi's retail wealth management portfolio in mainland China helps accelerate our plans. Another trend is the increasing demand for seamless, integrated, cross-border banking services, which innovation is helping us to deliver. We now have 1.3 million Global Money customers, up from 550,000 in 2022, and grew revenue from Wealth and Personal Banking international customers by 41% last year, from $7.2bn to $10.2bn. Critically, there was a 43% increase in new-to-bank international customers compared with 2022, driven by the new international proposition that we launched and continue to develop. As in wholesale, these international customers generate higher revenue, bringing in around three times as much as average domestic-only customers.\n\nThe third is continued growth in our two home markets. Our business is built on two very deep pools of liquidity in Hong Kong and the UK, which underpin our exceptional balance sheet strength and, therefore, all that we do as a business. Hong Kong and the UK are both also very profitable, wellconnected markets. We are well positioned to capitalise on our positions as the number one bank in Hong Kong and a leading bank in the UK. Hong Kong's connectivity, both globally and to mainland China, are helping us to grow our franchise. We have increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years, according to HKMA data. Meanwhile new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong increased by 36% over the same period as we have capitalised on the return of visitors from mainland China. In the UK, we have good traction in Commercial Banking and continue to grow market share in Wealth and Personal Banking. We are the leading bank for UK large corporates, with more than 70% market penetration last year, according to Coalition Greenwich. Euromoney also named us as the best bank in the UK for small and medium-sized enterprises, as digitisation helped to grow new-to-bank clients through Kinetic. We also increased our market share of UK mortgage stock, from 7.4% in 2020 to 8% in 2023, according to Bank of England data. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we are confident in our ability to grow further in these critical markets.",

        "page_content": "## Future growth levers\n\nIn 2023, we continued to build in areas we expect to drive future growth.\n\nWe brought in\n\n$84bn\n\nof net new invested assets in wealth.\n\nWe grew multi-jurisdictional wholesale revenue by\n\n29%\n\nfrom $15.8bn in 2022 to $20.4bn in 2023.\n\nWe have also continued to diversify our profit generation geographically across multiple markets. The positions that we have as a leading foreign bank in mainland China, India, Singapore, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Mexico - all of which are also well connected to our international network - mean we are well placed to capture opportunities in these fast-growing economies. This was again evident as they all grew reported profits significantly in 2023, with mainland China (excluding associates), India, and Singapore each contributing in excess of $1bn of profits to the Group.\n\nIt is critical that we maintain tight cost discipline. This was challenging in 2023 in a high inflation environment, and will likely remain so in 2024. At the same time, we need to invest in growth, so we remain very focused on maintaining tight underlying costs. The sale of our French retail banking operations completed on 1 January 2024, and the planned sale of our banking business in Canada remains due to complete in the first quarter of 2024. A number of smaller exits remain underway as we continue to look at opportunities to reshape our portfolio. At the same time, our acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to create a bigger, new proposition in HSBC Innovation Banking, which combines deep sector specialisms with our balance sheet strength and global reach, ensuring we continue our long history of supporting entrepreneurs.\n\nDriving cost savings enables us to invest in technology, which is the fourth opportunity. The digitisation of our business continues to improve customer experience and increase e/fficiency. Using AI to help price complex structural options in our Foreign Exchange business has cut execution times down from hours to minutes. We have also identified hundreds of opportunities to leverage generative AI, and will focus our e/fforts on use cases with tangible benefits for the Group and our customers.\n\nInnovation also creates new avenues for growth. We recently launched Zing, which is our open market mobile platform focused on cross-border payments, initially available in the UK. It o/ffers similar capabilities as Global Money does to our international Wealth and Personal Banking customers, but is targeted at non-HSBC customers and allows us to drive growth beyond our traditional customer footprint.\n\nUnderpinning all of this is our work to build a stronger performance culture, improve colleague experience and prepare our workforce for the future. This is important because achieving our ambitions depends on our 220,000 colleagues feeling motivated and believing in our strategy. In our most recent sta/ff survey, I was pleased that the number of colleagues seeing the positive impact of our strategy in 2023 was up 11 percentage points on 2020, which is also above the financial services sector benchmark.\n\nFinally, helping to finance the substantial investment needs of our customers in the transition to net zero is a growing commercial opportunity, as well as a necessity to mitigate rising financial and wider societal risks. Our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It also sets out our roadmap for implementing net zero, which we will do by supporting our customers, embedding net zero into the way we operate and partnering for systemic change. We understand that our approach - including our own transition plan - will need to evolve over time to keep pace with both the evolving science and real economy decarbonisation across the sectors and geographies we serve.\n\n## Thank you\n\nOn a personal note, one of the most enjoyable parts of 2023 for me was spending time with many of my colleagues around the world. Reconnecting with them, and seeing firsthand their passion for serving our customers, pride in HSBC and ambitions for the future, was energising and inspiring. Leading HSBC is a privilege, and my colleagues are the main reason why.\n\n2023 was a very good year for HSBC. We now have an opportunity to ensure that it becomes part of a longer-term trend of ongoing good performance and to secure the foundations for future success. I am confident that we have the opportunities, the platform and the team to enable us to get it done.\n\n## Noel Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n21 February 2024",

In our global businesses, WPB revenue increased by 31% on a constant currency basis, including a\n\nfavourable year-on-year impact relating to the sale of our retail banking business in France. In CMB, revenue increased by 40% on a constant currency basis, including a provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. In addition, revenue in GBM increased by 10% on a constant currency basis.\n\n## Focus\n\n## Wholesale - double down on leadership in international connectivity\n\nOur strength in international connectivity remains one of our key di/fferentiators. We seek to partner with our clients as they expand internationally, and capitalise on opportunities arising from the reconfiguration of global supply chains.\n\nIn 2023, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue 1 by 29% since 2022, supported by the interest rate environment. These customers also generate more revenue with us. In CMB, multi-jurisdictional corporate clients generate approximately five times the revenue of a domestic-only corporate customer. In addition, there was increased collaboration across markets. In GBM, crossborder client revenue from clients managed in the West and booked in the East increased by 39% from 2022.\n\nOur ambition is to maintain strong, resilient returns through the interest rate cycle. As such, we are prioritising growing capitallight, fee-income generating businesses, such as transaction banking. In 2023, we processed around $500tn electronic payment transactions, ranking second by Global Payments Solutions revenue in the first half of 2023 2 . We also facilitated over $850bn in trade and have been ranked first in revenue since 2018 2 .\n\n- 1  For further information and the basis of preparation for multi-jurisdictional client revenue, see page 1 34 .\n- 2  Global Payments Solutions and trade revenue rankings sourced from Coalition Greenwich.\n\n## WPB - build our international and wealth propositions\n\nWe continued to build our international and wealth propositions, taking advantage of the growth of wealth assets globally but especially in Asia. We amassed $84bn in net new invested assets in 2023, bringing total wealth invested assets to $1,191bn, an increase of 17% from 2022.\n\nIn 2023, our international strategy generated good results. We continued to attract international customers, who are either multi-jurisdictional, non-resident or resident foreigners, from our top 11 markets 1 . We increased new-to-bank customers 2 in this segment by 43% since 2022, bringing total international customers to 6.7 million. These customers also each generated approximately three times the income compared with domestic customers. As a result, we increased revenue in this segment by 41% compared with 2022.\n\nCustomers increasingly demand seamless banking across geographies. We continued to enhance Global Money, our mobile proposition that allows customers to spend and send money in multiple currencies. The product gained traction with more than 750,000 new customers in 2023, taking total customers to over 1.3 million.\n\n- 1  Top 11 markets include the UK, Hong Kong, Mexico, the US, India, Singapore, Malaysia, the UAE, Australia, mainland China and the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\n- 2  New-to-bank customers includes both new to bank customers and those customers who have opened an account in a new market, including those who already bank with us in one or more other markets.\n\n## Percentage of wholesale revenue from multi-jurisdictional customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Multi-jurisdictional customers\n- Domestic-only customers\n\n## Percentage of WPB revenue from international customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational customers\n\n- Domestic-only customers\n\nt",

Furthermore, a total of 75% of WPB's international customer accounts were opened digitally in 2023, an increase of 30 percentage points from 2022.\n\n## Energise\n\n## Inspire a dynamic culture\n\nWe are opening up a world of opportunity for our colleagues by building an inclusive organisation that empowers and energises them. We intend to accomplish this by building a stronger performance culture, improving colleague experience and preparing a workforce for the future.\n\nOur success is underpinned by our colleagues. In a changing world, we empower our colleagues by providing clarity of our strategy and opportunities for them to develop and have\n\nWe are also focused on building future-ready business models by investing in open-market propositions. In 2023, we announced a partnership with Tradeshift to launch a new embedded finance solution in the first half of 2024, which will provide payment and financial services embedded into trade, e-commerce and marketplace experiences. In January 2024, in the UK we launched Zing, a mobile platform enabling cross-border payments available to non-HSBC consumers.\n\nWe are also investing in innovative technologies for the future. In 2024, we plan to both concentrate our e/fforts and increase our\n\nfulfilling careers. Our 2023 employee Snapshot survey showed that 73% of our colleagues see the positive impact of our strategy, a 3 percentage point increase from 2022, and a 11 percentage point improvement from 2020. The survey also showed that 81% of our colleagues feel confident about HSBC's future, a 4 percentage point increase from 2022, and also a 11 percentage point improvement over 2020.\n\nWe remain focused on creating a diverse and inclusive environment.

Since then, we have taken a number of steps to execute on our ambition and manage climate risks. In January 2024, we published our first net zero transition plan, which provides an overview of the progress we have made to date and the actions being taken and planned to embed our net zero ambition across HSBC. It sets out how we intend to harness our strengths and capabilities in the areas where we believe we can support large-scale emissions reduction: transitioning industry, catalysing the new economy, and decarbonising trade and supply chains.\n\nTo support our customers through the transition to net zero and to a sustainable future, in 2020, we set out an ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investments by 2030. In 2023, we provided and facilitated $83.7bn of sustainable finance and investments, bringing our cumulative total since January 2020 to $294.4bn.\n\nAs part of our ambition to align our financed emissions to achieve net zero by 2050, we have set on-balance sheet or combined financed emissions targets for a number of emission-intensive sectors.\n\nWork continues on the integration of ESG and climate analysis into HSBC Asset\n\ninvestment in artificial intelligence ('Al'). At present, we employ Al in areas such as fraud detection and transaction monitoring. We also launched Al Markets, a digital service that utilises natural language processing to enrich the way investors interact with global markets. Additionally, we are in the process of piloting numerous generative Al use cases in areas like developer augmentation, creative content generation and knowledge management, and have identified hundreds more potential opportunities.\n\nleadership roles were held by women, and we are on track to achieve our ambition of 35% by 2025. We also set a Group-wide ethnicity strategy to better represent the communities we serve, with 3.0% of leadership roles in the UK and US held by colleagues of Black heritage in 2023, against our ambition of 3.4% by 2025. Additionally, in 2023, over 37.8% of our senior leaders have identified as being from an Asian heritage background.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the following 'ESG overview' section, we outline how we put our purpose and values into practice.\n\nManagement's actively managed product o/fferings to help ensure the ESG risks faced by companies are considered when making investment decisions and to assess ESG risks and opportunities that could impact investment performance.\n\nWe also made progress in our ambition to become net zero in our own operations and supply chain by 2030.

Our purpose is underpinned by our values: we value di/fference; we succeed together; we take responsibility; and we get it done.\n\nOur approach to ESG is shaped by our purpose and values and a desire to create sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders. As an international bank with significant breadth and scale, we understand that our economies, societies, supply chains and people's lives are interconnected. We recognise we can play an important role in helping to tackle ESG challenges. We focus our e/fforts on three areas: the transition to net zero, building inclusion and resilience, and acting responsibly.\n\n## Transition to net zero\n\nIn 2020, we set an ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050. Since then, we have made progress in support of this ambition including providing and facilitating sustainable finance and investment for our customers, updating several of our sustainability and investment risk policies, and setting 2030 targets for financed emissions in a range of high-emitting sectors.\n\nWe recognise both the commercial opportunity of taking action to transition to net zero and the potential risks of inaction by society at large. In our net zero transition plan, we provide an overview of the actions we are taking and plan to take to support our customers, embed net zero into the way we operate and partner for systemic change. We also set out how we are starting to work to integrate nature and just transition considerations into our net zero approach.\n\nWe set out in more detail the steps we are taking on our climate ambitions in the ESG review on page 41.\n\n## Build inclusion and resilience\n\nTo help create long-term value for all stakeholders, we focus on fostering inclusion and building resilience for our colleagues, our customers and the communities we operate within.\n\nFor colleagues, we focus on creating an inclusive, healthy and rewarding environment as this helps us to attract, develop and retain the best talent, and we support their resilience through well-being and learning resources. We continue to make progress towards our goals for gender and ethnic diversity.\n\nWe strive to provide an inclusive and accessible banking experience for our customers. We do this by providing resources that help them manage their finances, and services that help them protect what they value.\n\nWe are developing an updated global philanthropy strategy that aligns with our ESG areas of focus: 'transition to net zero' and 'building inclusion and resilience'.\n\n## Act responsibly\n\nWe are focused on operating a strong and sustainable business that puts the customer first, values good governance, and gives our stakeholders confidence in how we do what we do. Our conduct approach guides us to do the right thing and to focus on the impact we have on our customers and the financial markets in which we operate. Customer experience is at the heart of how we operate. We aim to act responsibly and with integrity across the value chain.\n\nOn page 15, we have set out ways that we have supported our stakeholders through a challenging year.\n\n## ESG disclosure map and directory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Transition            | Our approach to the transition                                         | Read more on our approach to the transition to net zero                                                                                                        | Page  45                  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| to net zero           | Supporting our customers                                               | Read more on our progress made against our $750bn   to $1tn sustainable finance and investment ambition                                                        | Page  49                  |\n|                       |                                                                        | Read more on our progress made against our ambition   to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050                                                    | Page  53                  |\n|                       | Embedding net zero into the way we  operate                            | Read more on our ambition to achieve net zero in our own  operations and supply chain by 2030                                                                  | Page  63                  |\n|                       | Partnering for systemic change                                         | Read more on how we partner externally in support of   systemic change                                                                                         | Page  68                  |\n|                       | Detailed Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') | We make disclosures consistent with Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') recommendations,  highlighted with the symbol:  TCFD         | Page  69                  |\n| Build  inclusion  and | Diversity and inclusion disclosures                                    | Read more on how we are building an inclusive environment  that reflects our customers and communities, and our latest   pay gap statistics                    | Page  76                  |\n| resilience            | Pay gap disclosures                                                    | Read more on how we are building an inclusive environment  that reflects our customers and communities, and our latest   pay gap statistics                    | Page  77                  |\n| Act  responsibly      | How we govern ESG                                                      | Read more on our approach to ESG governance and   human rights                                                                                                 | Page  88                  |\n| Act  responsibly      | Human rights and modern   slavery disclosures                          | Read more on our approach to ESG governance and   human rights                                                                                                 | Page  89                  |\n| Act  responsibly      | How our ESG targets link to  executive remuneration                    | Read more on our ESG targets embedded in executive  remuneration                                                                                               | Page  16 Pages 284 to 298 |\n| ESG Data  Pack        | Detailed ESG information                                               | Our ESG Data Pack provides more granular ESG information,  including the breakdown of our sustainable finance and  investment progress, and complaints volumes | www.hsbc.com/esg          |",

As the rising cost of living has been particularly high in the UK, one of our largest markets, most of our initiatives focused on supporting our UK personal and business customers. We have enhanced our range of digital resources available on our website and we are proactively approaching those most in need - both personal and business customers - to o/ffer targeted support and help build their financial resilience.\n\n## Proactive support\n\nFor personal customers in financial di/fficulty, we have developed our digital services with improvements to the 'Rising cost of living' hub on our public website in the UK. Use of segmentation data has enabled us to take a proactive approach to supporting customers and o/ffering targeted solutions to those who are identified as being most in need.\n\nWe have engaged with vulnerable customer groups through cost of living calls, targeted emails and direct mail. In 2023, we also:\n\n- - o/ffered customers the option to switch mortgage rates early, extend their mortgage term with an option to reverse it at a later date, or pay interest only for six months, as part of our commitment to the new UK Mortgage Charter;\n- - o/ffered a temporary reduction of fees on arranged overdrafts to help those most in need pay less;\n- - held over 1,000 financial well-being webinars, including 227 cost of living sessions for 50,000 customers and colleagues;\n- - helped more than 37,000 customers identify \u00a32.9m in potential benefits by providing access to a benefits calculator tool via our website; and\n- - helped more than 130,000 customers generate a financial fitness score, and obtain tips on how to improve their financial resilience using our online financial fitness tool.\n\nIn the UK, CMB has continued to support commercial banking clients exhibiting signs of financial vulnerability. We reviewed client needs on a case-by-case basis and provided solutions including repayment holidays, extending loan repayments and o/ffering extensions to collection periods. The use of data and front-line insights has improved our ability to identify financially vulnerable customers.\n\nIn 2023, we contacted targeted clients to help improve awareness of the support available, including communicating with over 178,000 SMEs and proactively making over 43,000 outbound calls.\n\nIncreasing understanding of fraud and scam risk and education on how to protect against becoming a victim continues to be another key area of focus. In 2023, we also:\n\n- - held fraud and scam awareness webinars to highlight recent trends and case studies, attended by approximately 4,300 customers;\n- - sent 2.1 million emails and 300,000 letters in quarterly campaigns to share our insights and enhance understanding of key fraud topics and trends; and\n- - published 44 articles and alerts on the HSBC Fraud and Cyber Awareness mobile app, covering a broad range of topics as well as any emerging threats and trends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our work to support vulnerable communities and customers see page 85.\n- For further details on our conduct and product responsibilities, see the ESG review on page 96.",

We will advocate the same from our customers, suppliers and the industry.\n\nWe have set out our key climate-related financial disclosures throughout the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 and related disclosures. We recognise that further work lies ahead as we continue to develop our management and reporting capabilities. In 2023, we made certain enhancements to our disclosures. These include enhancing our merger and acquisition process to consider potential climate and sustainability-related targets, net zero transition plans and climate strategy, and how this relates to HSBC. In addition, we published our net zero transition plan.\n\nWe have considered our 'comply or explain' obligation under both the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules and Sections 414CA and 414CB of the UK Companies Act 2006, and confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, including its annexes and supplemental guidance, save for certain items, which we summarise below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - For financed emissions we do not plan to set 2025 targets. We set targets in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA') guidelines by setting 2030 targets. While the NZBA defines 2030 as intermediate, we use di/fferent time horizons for climate risk management. For climate, we define short term as time periods up to 2025; medium term is between 2026 and 2035; and long term is between 2036 and 2050. These time periods align to the Climate Action 100+ disclosure framework. In 2023, we disclosed interim 2030 targets for financed emissions for a number of sectors as we outline on page 18. Following this, we have now set combined on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions targets for two emissions-intensive sectors: oil and gas, and power and utilities.\n- - The methodology and data used for financed emissions is evolving and we expect industry guidance, market practice, data availability, scenarios and regulatory disclosure requirements to continue to change, along with the shape of our own business. We expect to periodically review and, if required, update our methodologies, baselines, scenarios, and targets to reflect real economy decarbonisation and evolving guidance and data.\n- - We do not fully disclose impacts from climate-related opportunities on financial planning and performance including on revenue, costs and the balance sheet, quantitative scenario analysis, detailed climate risk exposures for all sectors and geographies or physical risk metrics. This is due to transitional challenges in relation to data limitations, although nascent work is ongoing in these areas. We expect these data limitations to be addressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented.\n- - We currently disclose four out of 15 categories of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions including business travel, supply chain and financed emissions. In relation to financed emissions, we publish on-balance sheet financed emissions for a number of sectors as detailed on page 18. We also publish facilitated emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. Future disclosures on financed emissions and related risks are reliant on our customers publicly disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, targets and plans, and related risks. We recognise the need to provide early transparency on climate disclosures but balance this with the recognition that existing data and reporting processes require significant enhancements.\n- For a full summary of our TCFD disclosures, including detailed disclosure locations for additional information, see pages 69 to 74. The additional information section on page 440 provides further detail.\n\n## Backing renewable connections in South America\n\nWe helped to finance one of the largest transmission lines in South America, which will connect central and southern Chile to renewable energy generated in the north.\n\nConexi\u00f3n is building the Kimal-Lo Aguirre initiative after winning a tender from Chile's Minister of Energy in 2022. The project will aim to develop approximately 1,400km of critical infrastructure with the ability to carry up to 3,000 million watts of energy when scheduled to complete in 2029.\n\nWe provided a $160m equity bridge loan to support China Southern Power Grid's contribution to the project. China Southern Power Grid is the second largest electric power company in China. The funds will help unlock energy transition infrastructure required to support Chile in achieving its net zero goals.",

Our ambition is to align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nOur net zero transition plan sets out how we intend to harness our strengths and capabilities in areas where we believe we can support large-scale emissions reduction: transitioning industry, catalysing the new economy, and decarbonising trade and supply chains. The plan also provides details on our sectoral approach, and on our implementation plan to embed net zero into the way we operate.\n\nWe continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary, and our ambition to achieve net zero in our own operations and supply chain by 2030. We also recognise that green and sustainable finance and investment taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n\nTo date, we have set 2030 financed emissions targets across energy, heavy industry and\n\ntransport, specifically for the following sectors: oil and gas; power and utilities; cement; iron, steel and aluminium; aviation; automotive; and thermal coal mining.\n\nFollowing a reduction in our exposure to the shipping sector after the strategic sale of part of our European shipping portfolio in 2023, and work undertaken to assess the materiality of our remaining portfolio from a financed emissions perspective, we have concluded that the remaining exposure as of year-end 2023 is not material enough to warrant setting a stand-alone target. This aligns with NZBA guidelines on sector inclusion for target setting. Due to ongoing data availability and quality challenges, we continue to assess our financed emissions for our real estate and agriculture sectors.\n\nWe recognise that there is a significant amount of uncertainty and complexity related to the transition, and that progress in the real economy will depend heavily on external factors including the policy and regulatory landscape across markets, the speed of technological innovation and growth, and economic and geopolitical events. In addition, climate science and the availability and quality of climate data continue to evolve, and the net zero-aligned scenarios upon which we have based our approach will also update\n\n| Net zero  implementation plan                | Metrics and indicators                                                                                  | Progress to date                                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Supporting our  customers                    | Sustainable finance and investment  provided and facilitated ($bn) 1                                    | $294.4bn cumulative progress since 2020 (for further breakdown   see page 49)                                                                             |\n|                                              | Number of sectors analysed for   financed emissions 2                                                   | We have set seven financed emissions targets, comprising five  on-balance sheet and two combined financed emissions targets   so far (see pages 53 to 62) |\n|                                              | Thermal coal financing exposures 2,3                                                                    | Our thermal coal financing drawn balance exposure was approximately  $1bn as at 31 December 2020 (for further details, see page 67)                       |\n| Embedding net zero  into the way we  operate | Percentage of absolute operational  greenhouse gas emissions reduced 4                                  | 57.3% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from 2019  baseline (see page 63)                                                                    |\n|                                              | Percentage of renewable electricity  sourced across our operations                                      | Increase from 48.3% in 2022 to 58.4% (see page 63)                                                                                                        |\n|                                              | Percentage of energy   consumption reduced                                                              | 26.3% reduction in energy consumption from 2019 baseline   (see page 63)                                                                                  |\n| Partnering for   systemic change             | Philanthropic investment in climate  innovation ventures, renewable energy,  and nature-based solutions | Committed $105m to our NGO partners since 2020, as part of the  Climate Solutions Partnership (see page 68)                                               |\n\nover time to keep pace with real economy developments. Emissions and broader customer data is also expected to improve, as well as approaches and standards for greenhouse gas accounting and target setting. As a result of this, we expect to regularly refine and update our analysis as well as data collection and consolidation processes to accommodate new data sources and updated methodologies and scenarios, and intend to be transparent on any changes we make and why. As an example, our ESG review includes recalculated 2019 and 2020 financed emissions figures for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. In addition, periodic updates to published net zero-aligned scenarios mean that it will be important that our net zero-aligned reference scenario choice, and by extension our target-setting approach, remain in step with the evolving real economy context and is informed by the latest science.\n\nIn the following table, we set out our metrics and indicators and assess our progress against them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our approach to measuring financed emissions, including scope, methodology, assumptions and limitations, see page 53.",

In the first instance we encourage colleagues to speak to their line manager, and our annual Snapshot survey showed that 86% of colleagues have trust in their direct manager. HSBC Confidential is our whistleblowing channel, which allows colleagues past and present to raise concerns confidentially and, if preferred, anonymously (subject to local laws). Our Snapshot survey showed that 80% of colleagues feel able to speak up when they see behaviours they consider to be wrong.\n\nWe promote an environment where our colleagues are treated with dignity and respect and we act where we find behaviours that fall short. Our inclusion index measures our colleagues' sense of belonging and psychological safety within the organisation, and in 2023 this increased to 78%.\n\nWe aspire to be an organisation that is representative of the communities in which we serve. We have committed to achieving a 35% representation of women in senior leadership roles (classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure) by 2025. We remain on track, having achieved 34.1% in 2023.\n\nWe aspire to achieve a 3.4% representation of Black heritage colleagues in senior leadership roles across the UK and US combined by 2025. We are on track to achieve this, having increased our representation to 3.0% this year. We continue to make progress but we know there is more to be done.\n\nTo ensure we set representation goals that are locally relevant, we enable our employees to self-disclose ethnicity data. We have enabled\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n91% of our colleagues to disclose their ethnicity, with 62% currently choosing to do so, where this is legally permissible.\n\nThe table below outlines high-level diversity metrics.\n\n## All employees\n\n| Male                | 48%   |\n|---------------------|-------|\n| Female              | 52%   |\n| Senior leadership 1 |       |\n| Male                | 66%   |\n| Female              | 34%   |\n| Holdings Board      |       |\n| Male                | 53%   |\n| Female              | 47%   |\n\n- 1  Senior leadership is classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure.\n- For further details of how we look after our people, including our diversity targets, how we encourage our employees to speak up, and our approach to employee conduct, see the Social section of the ESG review on page 75.\n\n## Listening to our customers\n\nWe continue to listen, learn and act on our customers' feedback. We have implemented the net promoter system, enabling us to share customer feedback with our front-line teams and allowing them to respond directly to customers. We also have dedicated global forums to promote continuous improvement of our customers' experience.\n\n## Social matters\n\nWe invest in the long-term prosperity of the communities where we operate. We aim to provide people, especially those in marginalised and vulnerable communities, with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive through the transition to a sustainable future. For this reason, we focus our support on programmes that help build inclusion and resilience. We also support climate solutions and innovation, and contribute to disaster\n\nrelief when needed. For examples of our programmes, see the 'Communities' section of the ESG review on page 86.\n\n## Human rights\n\nAs set out in our Human Rights Statement, we recognise the role of business in respecting human rights. Our approach is guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ('UNGPs') and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. Our Human Rights Statement, and annual statements under the UK's Modern Slavery Act, are available on www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ esg-and-responsible-business/esg-reportingcentre. For further details of our approach, see the 'Human rights' section of the ESG review on page 89.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n\nWe are required to comply with all applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws in every market and jurisdiction in which we operate while focusing on the spirit of relevant laws and regulations to demonstrate our commitment to ethical behaviours and conduct as part of our environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nFor details of our climate ambition and carbon emission metrics, see the ESG review on page 44.\n\n## Group non-financial and sustainability information statement\n\nThis section primarily covers Group nonfinancial and sustainability information as required by applicable regulations.

We review against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for our websites in 23 markets and mobile apps in 18 markets, and engaged with more than 10,000 colleagues, partners and companies through our digital accessibility training and awareness programme in 2023. To share best practice externally, HSBC sponsored and hosted AbilityNet's Techshare Pro at our head o/ffice in the UK. Our work on digital accessibility was recognised through 11 awards in 2023, including in Hong Kong, where we were the only financial services provider to be recognised for our core banking apps.",

        "page_content": "## Principal strategic decisions\n\nThe Board operates having regard to the duties of the Directors, including the relevant matters set out in section 172(1)(a)-(f) of the Companies Act 2006. A key focus for the Board is setting, and monitoring execution against, the Group strategy. Principal decisions taken by the Board consider how the decision furthers the Group purpose, and aligns with one or all of the strategic pillars: 'Focus', 'Digitise', 'Energise' and 'Transition'.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how the Board operated having regard to the duties of the Directors. Good governance practices adopted by the Board facilitate its key decision taking. Governance features as an agenda item at all scheduled Board meetings. Papers presented to the Board for consideration are expected to follow a template to help ensure that Directors get the right level of information to take informed decisions in keeping with their duties. The template requests authors to, among others things, describe the extent to which relevant stakeholders are engaged with, or impacted by, the matter under consideration, and whether this has influenced the recommendation to the Board.\n\n## Group strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the Board's responsibility to set, and monitor execution against, HSBC's strategy, Directors take into consideration the Group's strategies across the global businesses and legal entities. The Board continued to oversee the progression of the Group's divestment of non-core operations while targeting select acquisitions. One such principal decision taken during the year was the acquisition by HSBC UK Bank plc of SVB UK. In considering this opportunity, the Board took into account the views of key stakeholders, including UK regulators and the government. It also considered the potential impact of the acquisition on SVB UK customers, principally that their banking services would be maintained, backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC. The Board also considered how the acquisition would enhance shareholder value, strengthen our CMB franchise, and further its ability to serve innovation and fast-growing firms in the technology and life sciences sectors, supporting our 'Focus' strategic pillar. Following the acquisition of SVB UK, HSBC Innovation Banking was\n\n## Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board is responsible for the oversight of the Group's sustainability and ESG strategy setting and delivery, and monitors progress against execution of our net zero ambitions. Key outcomes are reviewed regularly by the Board. Directors also received training on ESG-related matters as part of their ongoing development.\n\nThe Board's understanding of the progress against the Group's ESG strategy was informed by the ESG dashboard. The data provided in this dashboard included key metrics that help the Board to monitor progress against the Group's ESG ambitions, including the transition to net zero, building inclusion and resilience, and acting responsibly. Additional details were provided on metrics relating to the roll-out of the Group's supplier code of conduct, female entrepreneurship and gender diversity in senior roles.\n\nIn 2023, the Board gave the Group Executive Committee feedback on the need to better\n\nlaunched in June 2023. Senior management embarked on a programme of communication and interactions with customers, employees and investors by way of townhalls and Q&A sessions to help key stakeholders understand the rationale for the transaction and reiterate HSBC's support for its customers.\n\nThe Board continued its monitoring and oversight of the impacts flowing from its principal strategic decisions taken in the current and previous years, in particular the sale of the retail banking operations in France and the planned sale of the banking business in Canada. The Board met in order to agree amended terms to complete our France business sale. It was updated regularly, and provided input as appropriate, on actions required to ensure the successful completion of these transactions. It also liaised with relevant stakeholders such as governments, regulators, work councils, employees and customers, as necessary.\n\nIn this way, the Board e/ffectively carried out its duties and assured itself that the principal\n\ndefine core areas of the Group's sustainability execution programme, a Group-wide programme to enable the delivery of our sustainability agenda. The core areas included accountability, governance, capability, investment in infrastructure and data. Governance was enhanced by the establishment of the Sustainability Execution Committee, with responsibility to oversee delivery of the sustainability execution programme. This committee reports to the Group Executive Committee which receives regular updates on progress towards fulfilment of our net zero ambitions. It takes into account key stakeholder considerations and potential impacts on the Group's strategic direction for sustainability, and reports these to the Board, helping Directors take relevant decisions. In addition, three non-executive Directors participated in climate advisory panel meetings with external subject matter experts to discuss sustainability, including the Group's net zero transition plan.\n\nAppreciating the importance of the Group's commitment to publish a net zero transition plan, the Board took the decision to establish a dedicated sub-group with responsibility for overseeing its finalisation, taking into consideration the implications for all our stakeholders and communication of the plan to the market. This sub-group included four non-executive Directors, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial O/fficer, as well as other members of senior management. It took into consideration the short-term consequences on stakeholders, particularly for customers and investors, and balanced these against long-term benefits for the Group, the society in which we live, and the success of the company as a whole for the long term. Recommendations made to the Board by the sub-group, including stakeholder impacts, helped to inform the Board's deliberations, leading to its final approval of the net zero transition plan, published in January 2024.\n\nstrategic decisions taken were, and continue to be, most likely to promote the long-term success of the company.\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Board continued a targeted focus on receiving relevant and succinct management information, including key metrics and data, to help demonstrate progress against strategic areas of interest. The Board considered how it should be informed, in the most transparent way, on the evolution of the Group's strategy from transformation to one focused on growth. The Board has agreed key performance indicators to help keep it informed on relevant areas of strategic progress, all of which are focused on four overarching perspectives: external commitments/key outcomes; key business drivers; sustainable financial performance; and the ability to transform and license to operate. These indicators will also be used to foster a culture of performance and discipline across the organisation and will be factored into executive Directors' scorecards.",

In overseeing legal entity and global business strategies, the Board acts to promote connectivity of technology strategies across the organisation.\n\nTo help assure the Board that the Vision 27 initiatives remained strategically aligned and appropriately resourced, it supported the appointment of a third-party professional services firm to conduct a review. The third party engaged with employees from across\n\n## Financial performance and capital returns\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen taking its decision to approve the annual financial resource plan, the Board engaged in active deliberation, taking into account stakeholders' perspectives, including customers, employees and investors, as well as market perception and regulatory expectations. The Board considered the alignment between the Group's medium-term strategic and investment plans with projected performance throughout the annual financial resource plan. In addition, consideration was given to scenario analysis related to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment to ascertain the risks - and potential mitigating actions - to best protect the Group's financial performance and capital returns.\n\nIn 2023, the Board adopted a dividend policy designed to provide sustainable cash\n\n## People and culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach Board meeting starts with a culture moment - a standing agenda item for one of the Board members, on a rotational basis, to share insights into their perceptions on how the Group culture is being lived. These perceptions help the Board to fulfil its responsibility of monitoring the Group's culture. They also serve to shape and frame discussions more generally in Board meetings.\n\nThe Board regularly considers updates on people and the workforce, supported by key metrics and culture insights. These updates help the Board understand employee sentiment, including any upward or downward trends, which informs considerations of how the tone from the top is being embedded. Regular reporting to the Board and/or its committees from the Group Chief Human Resources O/fficer includes metrics on attrition, whistleblowing, escalations, employee understanding of strategy and pay sentiment across our legal entities. This, together with the annual Snapshot survey results, demonstrate\n\nthe global businesses and functions to explore how the organisation was executing various technological initiatives.\n\nThe third party's review was facilitated by its attendance at the newly formed technology steering committee, overseen by the Board's Technology Governance Working Group. This steering committee comprised senior management including global business representatives to ensure that business views were well represented. The insights gained from the steering committee helped to form its reports to the Technology Governance Working Group, which in turn reports to the\n\ndividends, while retaining the flexibility to invest and grow the business in the future, supplemented by additional shareholder distributions, if appropriate. To this end, in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022, the Board approved the Group's announcement regarding its intention to revert to paying quarterly dividends from the first quarter of 2023. Following discussion at the Board, subject to the completion of the sale of the banking business in Canada, the Board agreed its intention to consider the payment of a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use of the proceeds generated by the completion of the transaction. On 21 February 2023, an interim dividend of $0.23 per share for the 2022 full-year was announced, followed by interim dividends of $0.10 each on 2 May 2023, 1 August 2023 and\n\npeople-related challenges and successes across the Group and legal entities. In these ways the Board broadens its understanding of the interests of our employees, which in turn helps to shape its decisions or add value when asked to approve HR policy and other peoplerelated matters.\n\nThe dedicated workforce engagement non-executive Director provides a regular report to Board meetings, which together with the Directors' own participation in arranged employment engagement activities, strengthen the Board's appreciation of what matters to employees, and help to inform decisions related to HR and people matters. An example of people and culture data and engagements assisting Board decision making in 2023 included the discussion held by the Board on a strategic focus around 'the workforce of the future' programme. This programme is looking at the key workforce skills necessary for the future, the role of technology in the workplace and development\n\nBoard. It also attended a Board meeting in person to discuss the independent review. The findings from the report helped deepen the Board's understanding of contributing factors to the success of Vision 27.\n\nAs a result of the review and related Board discussions, in order to enhance governance around overseeing the progress of the Group's long-term technology strategy, the Board agreed that a new Board committee will be established in 2024 in place of the Technology Governance Working Group, to be chaired by a non-executive Director.\n\n30 October 2023. In approving the payment of the dividends, the Board took into account the interests of the shareholders and sought to act in the best interests of the members as a whole.\n\nIn addition to dividend payments, HSBC undertook share buy-backs of up to $2bn each commencing on 10 May 2023 and 3 August 2023, and commenced a further buy-back of up to $3bn on 1 November 2023. In considering the buy-backs, the Board (or the Chairman's Committee with delegated authority from the Board) took into account its stated intention to consider buy-backs subject to appropriate capital levels, the views of its regulators with regard to its regulatory capital requirements and, in particular, the benefit to shareholders, and determined that the buy-backs would promote the success of the company.\n\nof a plan for its implementation. For further details of how we structure engagement between the Board and the workforce, see page 257.\n\nThe Board took the decision in 2023 to approve HSBC's new headquarters and to move to the new Panorama St Paul's development. This decision was facilitated by people data gathered from the Snapshot survey and other methods that demonstrated a desire from colleagues to continue to create an agile and technologically fit-for-purpose environment to work and succeed together. The Board took this decision knowing that a new purpose-built o/ffice and the continuation of a hybrid working model would enable the Group to continue to attract top talent, and provide them with collaboration spaces to support their success and well-being. The Board concluded the new headquarters would be in the best interests of the company for the long term. For further details of the new head o/ffice, see page 99.\n\nt",

Our reward principles and commitments centre on rewarding colleagues responsibly, recognising their success and supporting colleagues to grow.\n\nPay is a critical part of our proposition. We were encouraged by a nine percentage point improvement to 52% in colleagues' perceptions they are paid fairly because of actions we took through 2022. The Group Remuneration Committee remain very focused on the need to improve this further. For 2024, we are putting more structure in place to improve transparency and clarity about how we make pay decisions.\n\n## Rewarding colleagues responsibly\n\nFixed pay increases for 2024 were determined based on consistent principles to help address wage inflation in the markets where we operate.\n\nAs part of the 2023 pay review we introduced fixed pay ranges to help managers make fair and competitive fixed pay decisions and improve clarity for colleagues.\n\nWe will award an overall global fixed pay increase of 4.4% in 2024, compared with 5.5% for the previous year, reflecting lower wage inflation in many markets.\n\nThe level of increases vary by market, depending on the economic situation and individual roles.\n\nTo ensure fixed pay levels provide financial security to colleagues, we established Living Wage benchmarks for every market and have been certified by the Fair Wage Network as a global Living Wage employer for 2024. This is an important commitment we make to our employees and the communities in which we operate to help ensure we pay responsibly and provide financial security.\n\nMore than 95% of colleagues have private medical insurance, a retirement plan and life insurance.\n\n## Recognising colleagues' success\n\nThe Group Remuneration Committee determined an overall variable pay pool for Group employees of $3,774m (2022: $3,359m). This followed a review of our performance against financial and non-financial metrics set out in the Group risk framework.\n\nIndividual variable pay outcomes varied significantly depending on role, business area and performance. Our highest performers and those who role-model our values-aligned behaviours received the largest increases in variable pay compared with the previous year.\n\n## Remuneration for our executive Directors\n\nVariable pay for our executive Directors is driven by achievement against performance scorecards set by the Group Remuneration Committee at the start of the year to align pay outcomes with the delivery of our strategy and plan.\n\nThe Committee considered carefully the impact of strategic transactions and one-o/ffs on the Group's financial performance in 2023. Consistent with the approach in prior years, the Committee judged that it was appropriate to assess financial performance for the purpose of the annual scorecard excluding these items, to ensure that out-turns were not impacted by one-o/ffs.\n\nReflecting on the overall risk management in the year and in respect of the PRA Notice relating to compliance with the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme and related Depositor Protection rules, the Committee applied a downward adjustment of 7.5% to Noel Quinn's annual incentive outcome.\n\nThe Committee also carefully considered the executive Directors' pay outcomes in the context of pay decisions made for the wider workforce and determined that these were an appropriate reflection of Group, business and individual performance delivered in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Details of the current executive Directors' remuneration policy can be found on pages 257 to 265 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2021.\n\n## Variable pay pool\n\n($m)($m)\n\n|   2023 | 3,774   |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2022 | 3,359   |\n\n2019 From 2024, we will introduce a new variable pay structure for over 150,000 junior and middle management colleagues, providing more clarity around the variable pay levels for on-target performance, while retaining flexibility to di/fferentiate outcomes for performance.\n\n## Supporting colleagues to grow\n\nGuided by data and colleague feedback, the pillars of our well-being programme are mental, physical, financial and social well-being.\n\nIn our 2023 employee Snapshot survey, 83% of employees said their mental health was positive, while all measures of physical wellbeing (exercise, sleep, nutrition) have improved.

Excluding the impact of strategic transactions and the impairment of our investment in BoCom, RoTE was 15.6%.\n\nFrom 2024, we intend to revise the adjustments made to RoTE to exclude all notable items, improving alignment with the treatment of notable items in our other income statement disclosures. On this basis, we continue to target a RoTE in the mid-teens for 2024. If this basis had been adopted for 2023, our RoTE excluding notable items would have been 16.2%.\n\nOur guidance reflects our current outlook for the global macroeconomic environment, including customer and financial markets activity.\n\nTarget basis operating expenses\n\n## $31.6bn\n\n(2022: $29.8bn)\n\nIn 2023, the Group targeted cost growth of approximately 3% on a target basis. Our target basis excluded the impact of foreign currency translation di/fferences, notable items and the impact of retranslating the 2022 results of hyperinflationary economies at constant currency, as well as cost growth from our acquisition of SVB UK and related investments internationally.\n\nIn 2023, target basis cost growth was 6% compared with 2022. In addition to our targeted growth of 3%, there was an incremental rise of approximately 1%,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthese in 2023, and - where relevant - our expectations for 2024 and beyond. We also include a more detailed table covering further key financial metrics that we consider insightful for understanding the Group's performance.\n\nThe Group financial results that follow provide more detailed insight into the performance\n\nprimarily due to technology expenditure, which we did not mitigate. We also increased performance-related pay, which resulted in a further rise of around 1%. Costs grew by an additional 1%, primarily due to a charge relating to the FDIC special assessment.\n\nIn 2024, we will target growth of approximately 5% compared with 2023, on a target basis (2023: $31.1bn). This target reflects our current business plan for 2024, and includes an increase in sta/ff compensation, higher technology spend and investment for growth and e/fficiency, in part mitigated by cost savings from actions taken during 2023.\n\nOur cost target basis for 2024 excludes the direct cost impact of the disposal in France and the planned disposal in Canada from the 2023 baseline. It is measured on a constant currency basis and excludes notable items and the impact of retranslating the prior year results of hyperinflationary economies at constant currency.\n\nCapital and dividend policy CET1 ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend payout ratio 50%\n\nAt 31 December 2023, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.8%, which was higher than our medium-term target range of 14% to 14.5%.

It covers income statement performance on both a reported and constant currency basis, and the main factors impacting the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity position.\n\nexclude from earnings per share material notable items and related impacts. See page 131 for our calculation of earnings per share.\n\nWe aim to retain our dividend payout ratio of 50% for 2024, excluding material notable items and related impacts. From 2024 this will be disclosed as our 'dividend payout ratio target basis'.\n\n## Interest rate management strategy\n\nOur ambition is to maintain strong, resilient returns through the interest rate cycle. As part of our balance sheet structural hedging and risk management strategy we continue to seek opportunities to stabilise future earnings and mitigate downside risk from interest rate movements. During 2023, we took actions to increase the size and duration of our structural hedge.

        "page_content": "## Basis of presentation\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nOn 1 January 2023, HSBC adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'. As required by the standard, the Group applied the requirements retrospectively with comparative data previously published under IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' restated from the 1 January 2022 transition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details, see 'Changes to presentation from 1 January 2023' on page 100.\n\n## Changes to our reporting framework\n\nOn 1 January 2023, we updated our financial reporting framework. We no longer report 'adjusted' results, which excluded the impact of both foreign currency translation di/fferences and significant items. Instead, we compute constant currency performance by adjusting comparative reported results only for the e/ffects of foreign currency translation di/fferences between the relevant periods.\n\n## Constant currency performance\n\nConstant currency performance is computed by adjusting reported results of comparative\n\n## Reported results (vs 2022)\n\n## Reported profit\n\nReported profit before tax of $30.3bn was $13.3bn higher. This was driven by a $15.4bn increase in revenue, primarily due to growth in net interest income, reflecting the impact of interest rate rises. The increase also included a provisional gain of $1.6bn recognised on the acquisition of SVB UK in 2023, as well as a year-on-year favourable impact of $2.5bn associated with the sale of our retail banking operations in France. This reflected an initial impairment loss of $2.3bn following the initial classification of these operations as held for sale in 2022, a reversal of $2.1bn in the first quarter of 2023 as the sale became less certain, and a subsequent impairment loss of $2.0bn as we reclassified these operations as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThese increases were in part o/ffset by an impairment charge in 2023 of $3.0bn relating to our investment in BoCom. This impairment reflected a reduction to the accounting value-in-use in line with recent market-wide developments in mainland China. For further details, see page 101. This impairment will have no material impact on HSBC's capital, capital ratios or distribution capacity and therefore no impact on dividends or share buy-backs. Reported operating expenses decreased, primarily reflecting a reduction in restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022, which mitigated growth notably from higher technology spend, an increase in the performance-related pay\n\nperiods for the e/ffects of foreign currency translation di/fferences, which distort periodon-period comparisons.\n\nWe consider constant currency performance to provide useful information for investors by aligning internal and external reporting, and reflecting how management assesses periodon-period performance.\n\nThe results of our global businesses are presented on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with how we manage and assess global business performance.\n\n## Notable items\n\nWe separately disclose 'notable items', which are components of our income statement that management would consider as outside the normal course of business and generally non-recurring in nature.\n\nThe tables on pages 112 to 113 and pages 123 to 128 detail the e/ffects of notable items on each of our global business segments and legal entities during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\naccrual and the impact of inflation. Reported ECL of $3.4bn decreased by $0.1bn and included charges of $1.0bn relating to exposures in the commercial real estate sector in mainland China.\n\nReported profit after tax of $24.6bn was $8.3bn higher than in 2022. This included a higher tax expense, in part from the nonrecurrence of a $2.2bn gain in 2022 resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset from historical tax losses in HSBC Holdings.\n\n## Reported revenue\n\nReported revenue of $66.1bn was $15.4bn or 30% higher, which included a $2.5bn yearon-year favourable impact relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France, and the recognition of a $1.6bn provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK in 2023, as mentioned above.\n\nThe remaining growth primarily reflected the impact of interest rate rises, mainly in Global Payments Solutions ('GPS') in CMB and GBM, Personal Banking and Global Private Banking in WPB, as well as Securities Services in GBM. There were also good performances in Capital Markets and Advisory and Securities Financing in GBM, as well as in life insurance and asset management in WPB. An increase in revenue in Corporate Centre was driven by Central Treasury, mainly due to the nonrecurrence of adverse fair value movements on financial instruments, and valuation gains on structural hedging.\n\nMaterial notable items are a subset of notable items, which are excluded from our earnings per share measure for the purposes of calculating our dividend payout ratio, and from 2024 will be referred to as on a 'dividend payout ratio target basis'. Categorisation as a material notable is dependent on the nature of each item in conjunction with the financial impact on the Group's income statement.\n\n## Management view of revenue on a constant currency basis\n\nOur global business segment commentary includes tables that provide breakdowns of revenue on a constant currency basis by major product. These reflect the basis on which revenue performance of the businesses is assessed and managed.\n\n## Comparative periods\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all performance commentary that follows compares our results in 2023 with those of 2022.\n\nThese increases were partly o/ffset by lower Credit and Lending revenue in CMB and GBM, mainly driven by a fall in balances and margin compression, and a decline in revenue in Equities in GBM, reflecting weaker client demand and softer market conditions.\n\nRevenue reduced in Markets Treasury due to the impact of rising interest rates on our funding costs and flattening yield curves, partly o/ffset by increases from dynamic risk management and redeployment of asset disposals. We incurred losses on asset disposals of $1.0bn relating to repositioning and risk management activities in our hold-tocollect-and-sell portfolio in certain key legal entities. These actions are accretive to net interest income and reduce the consumption of the Group's financial resources. This revenue is allocated to our global businesses.\n\nRevenue in 2023 was also adversely a/ffected by a $1.4bn impact of hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, including the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, compared with a $0.4bn adverse impact in 2022.",

The charge in 2023 primarily comprised stage 3 net charges, notably related to mainland China commercial real estate sector exposures. ECL charges in this sector were $1.0bn in 2023. The charge in 2023 also reflected the impact of continued economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. The charge in 2022 included $1.3bn of charges related to mainland China commercial real estate exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of the calculation of ECL, see pages 156 to 168.\n\n## Reported operating expenses\n\nReported operating expenses of $32.1bn were $0.6bn or 2% lower, primarily driven by lower restructuring and other related costs of $3.0bn following the completion of our cost to achieve programme, which concluded at the end of 2022. The reduction also included favourable foreign currency translation di/fferences between the periods of $0.4bn, a $0.2bn reduction due to a reversal of historical asset impairments, and the e/ffects of our\n\ncontinued cost discipline. There was also a favourable impact of $0.2bn due to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina in 2023.\n\nThese reductions were partly o/ffset by increases in technology costs, the impacts of inflation, a higher performance-related pay accrual and severance payments. There was also an increase in the UK bank levy of $0.3bn, including adjustments relating to prior years, and we incurred a $0.2bn charge in the US relating to the FDIC special assessment.\n\nThe number of employees expressed in fulltime equivalent sta/ff ('FTE') at 31 December 2023 was 220,861, an increase of 1,662 compared with 31 December 2022. The number of contractors at 31 December 2023 was 4,676, a decrease of 1,371 due to the completion of our cost-saving programme.\n\n## Reported share of profit from associates and joint ventures less impairment\n\nReported share of profit from associates and joint ventures included an impairment charge of $3.0bn relating to our investment in BoCom due to a reduction to the accounting value-\n\nin-use of the investment, resulting in a loss of $0.2bn in 2023. This compared with a profit of $2.7bn in 2022. The impact of the impairment in 2023 was partly o/ffset by an increase in the share of profit from Saudi Awwal Bank ('SAB').\n\n## Tax expense\n\nThe e/ffective tax rate for 2023 of 19.1% was higher than the 4.7% in 2022. The e/ffective tax rate for 2023 was increased by 2.3 percentage points by the non-deductible impairment of investments in associates, and reduced by 1.6 percentage points by the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions and reduced by 1.5 percentage points by the non-taxable bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. The e/ffective tax rate for 2022 was reduced by 12.8 percentage points by the recognition of a deferred tax asset on historical tax losses of HSBC Holdings as a result of improved profit forecasts for the UK tax group. Excluding these items, the e/ffective tax rates were 19.9% for 2023 and 17.5% for 2022.",

The charge in 2023 also reflected the impact of continued economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.\n\nLoans and advances to customers as a percentage of customer accounts was 58.2%, compared with 58.8% at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Distributable reserves\n\nThe distributable reserves of HSBC Holdings at 31 December 2023 were $30.9bn, a $4.3bn decrease since 2022, primarily driven by $18.6bn in ordinary dividend, additional tier 1 coupon and share buy-back payments, o/ffset by profits generated and other reserve movements of $14.3bn. Distributable reserves are sensitive to impairments of investments in subsidiaries to the extent they are not o/ffset by the realisation of related reserves. The impairment of BoCom in 2023 did not impact distributable reserves, as its intermediate parent and direct subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, HSBC Asia Holdings Limited, was not impaired.\n\n## Capital position\n\nWe actively manage the Group's capital position to support our business strategy and meet our regulatory requirements at all times, including under stress, while optimising our capital e/fficiency. To do this, we monitor our capital position using a number of measures. These include our capital ratios and the impact on our capital ratios as a result of stress.\n\nOur CET1 ratio at 31 December 2023 was 14.8%, up 0.6 percentage points from 2022, mainly driven by capital generation net of dividends, share buy-backs and regulatory\n\nOperating expenses were $0.2bn or 1% lower on a constant currency basis, as reduced restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme were broadly o/ffset by increases in technology costs, the impacts of inflation, and a higher performance-related pay accrual. There was also an increase in the UK bank levy, including adjustments relating to prior years, and a charge in the US relating to a special assessment of the FDIC.\n\nShare of profit in associates and joint ventures less impairment included a $3.0bn impairment of our investment in BoCom due to a revision to the accounting value-in-use of the investment, resulting in a loss of $0.2bn in 2023. This compared with a share of profit of $2.6bn in 2022 on a constant currency basis. The impact of the impairment was partly o/ffset by an increase in the share of profit from SAB.\n\nadjustments, which was partly o/ffset by an increase in risk-weighted assets ('RWAs') during the year.\n\n## Liquidity position\n\nWe actively manage the Group's liquidity and funding to support the business strategy and meet regulatory requirements at all times, including under stress. To do this, we monitor our position using a number of risk appetite measures, including the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio. During 2023, the average high-quality liquid assets we held was $647.5bn. This excludes highquality liquid assets in legal entities which are not transferable due to local restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, see page 206.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt",

The refresh involved six services launched across 10 international markets, with the aim of helping customers move and invest overseas easier.\n\nThis included supporting our international customers, who generate around three times the average revenue of a domestic customer, so they can open an international account digitally predeparture, gain access to a credit card in their new market with an appropriate limit, and make use of quick, competitively priced cross-border payment solutions with 24/7 global support to manage their international needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo meet our customers' needs, we o/ffer a full suite of products and services across transactional banking, lending and wealth.\n\nWPB continued to invest in our key strategic priorities of expanding our Wealth franchise, developing our transactional banking and lending capabilities, and addressing our customers' international needs.\n\nPerformance in 2023 benefited from rising interest rates and balance sheet growth, including Wealth deposits. There was also positive growth in Wealth, including strong sales in insurance and net new invested assets growth. The results included a broadly stable ECL charge, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\n|                                        | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     | 2023 vs 2022   | 2023 vs 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Results - on a constant currency basis | $m       | $m       | $m       | $m             | %              |\n| Net operating income                   | 27,275   | 20,884   | 20,972   | 6,391          | 31             |\n| ECL                                    | (1,058)  | (1,186)  | 195      | 128            | 11             |\n| Operating expenses                     | (14,738) | (14,248) | (15,338) | (490)          | (3)            |\n| Share of profit in associates and JVs  | 65       | 30       | 36       | 35             | >100           |\n| Profit before tax                      | 11,544   | 5,480    | 5,865    | 6,064          | >100           |\n| RoTE (annualised) 1  (%)               | 28.5     | 13.8     |          |                |                |\n\n- 1  RoTE (annualised) in 2022 included a 4.7 percentage point adverse impact from the impairment losses relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France.\n\n## Divisional highlights\n\n## $84bn\n\nWPB net new invested assets in 2023, up 6% compared with 2022.\n\nConstant currency profit before tax ($bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2023 |   11.5 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2022 |    5.5 |\n|   2021 |    5.9 |\n\n2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational customers at 31 December 2023, an increase of 12% compared with 2022.\n\nConstant currency net operating income ($bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2023 |   27.3 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2022 |   20.9 |\n|   2021 |   21   |\n\n2019\n\n- International customers are those who bank with us in our 11 key markets, excluding Canada, and who bank in more than one market, those whose address is di/fferent from the market we bank them in and customers whose nationality, or country of birth for non-resident Indians and overseas Chinese, is di/fferent to the market we bank them in.

The growth in revenue reflected growth in both Personal Banking and Wealth. The increase also reflected a $2.4bn year-onyear impact relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. ECL remained broadly stable and operating expenses grew by $0.5bn.\n\nRevenue of $27.3bn was $6.4bn or 31% higher on a constant currency basis.\n\nIn Wealth, revenue of $7.5bn was up $0.6bn or 8%.\n\n- - Global Private Banking revenue was $0.2bn or 12% higher due to rising interest rates and deposit growth of $11bn or 15%.\n- - Asset management revenue was $0.2bn or 13% higher, driven by an increase in assets under management of 15%, and from positive market movements.\n- - Life insurance revenue rose by $0.1bn or 8%, mainly driven by an increase of $0.2bn\n\nin contractual service margin ('CSM') earnings and favourable net investment returns of $0.1bn, partly o/ffset by a $0.3bn loss from corrections to historical valuation estimates. There was strong growth in the new business CSM, up $0.6bn or 47%, mainly in Hong Kong.\n\nIn Personal Banking, revenue of $20.5bn was up $4.5bn or 28%.\n\n- - Net interest income was $4.5bn or 31% higher due to rising interest rates and balance sheet growth. Mortgage lending balances rose in Hong Kong by $6bn and in HSBC UK by $5bn. Unsecured lending balances increased by $3bn, notably in HSBC UK, Mexico and Hong Kong. In addition, there was an increase of $7.8bn from a reclassification of secured loans in France from held for sale. Deposit balances remained broadly stable as growth in Asia was partly o/ffset by outflows, mainly in HSBC UK due to higher cost of living and competitive pressures, and in our main entity in the US.\n\nOther revenue increased by $1.3bn, mainly due to a $2.4bn year-on-year impact relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. This was partly o/ffset by a $0.7bn reduction in Markets Treasury allocated revenue, including disposal losses on repositioning and an adverse impact of $0.5bn due to hyperinflationary accounting.\n\nECL were $1.1bn in 2023, down $0.1bn on a constant currency basis, as credit performance remained resilient, despite a rise in inflationary pressures.\n\nOperating expenses of $14.7bn were $0.5bn or 3% higher on a constant currency basis, mainly due to continued investments, notably in wealth in Asia, higher technology spend, higher performance-related pay and the impact of higher inflation. These increases were partly o/ffset by a reduction in restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022 and ongoing cost discipline.\n\nt",

This was driven by an increase in revenue in all our main legal entities, primarily from a $5.3bn increase in GPS net interest income. It also included a provisional gain of $1.6bn from HSBC UK's acquisition of SVB UK. These increases were partly o/ffset by a rise in operating expenses as a result of the SVB UK acquisition and increases in technology costs.\n\nRevenue of $22.9bn was $6.6bn or 40% higher on a constant currency basis.\n\n- - In GPS, revenue increased by $5.4bn, with growth in all main legal entities. The increase was driven by higher margins, reflecting interest rate rises and repricing actions, which were partly o/ffset by lower average balances notably due to a marketwide reduction in the UK. There was a 6% increase in fee income, as business initiatives drove growth in transaction banking, with higher volumes in cards and international payments.\n- - In Global Trade and Receivables Finance ('GTRF'), revenue decreased by $0.1bn or\n\n2%, driven by lower average balances in\n\nour main legal entities in Asia and Europe,\n\nprimarily reflecting the softer trade cycle,\n\npartly o/ffset by wider margins in our legal\n\nentities in Latin America and the UK. In\n\naddition, there was a $28m or 3% increase\n\nin fee income.\n\n- - In Credit and Lending, revenue decreased by $0.4bn or 7%, notably in our main legal entities in Asia and Europe, primarily due to margin compression. It also reflected lower balances due to softer demand from customers across these markets, and reduced exposures in the commercial real estate sector, notably in mainland China and the US.\n- - In GBM products, Insurance and Investments and Other, revenue increased by $1.6bn, driven by incremental revenue from HSBC Innovation Banking of $2.1bn, which included the provisional gain of $1.6bn on the acquisition of SVB UK. There was also an increase in collaboration revenue from GBM products of $0.1bn, notably in Foreign Exchange. These increases were partly o/ffset by a reduction in Markets Treasury allocated income of $0.6bn, including disposal losses on portfolio repositioning and the adverse\n\nimpacts of hyperinflationary accounting of $0.6bn. The remaining increase in revenue reflected higher interest on capital held in the business, partly o/ffset by higher HSBC Holdings interest expense.\n\n- ECL were a charge of $2.1bn, compared with a charge of $1.9bn in 2022 on a constant currency basis. The increase of $0.2bn was mainly driven by higher stage 3 charges in the UK, and included provisions from HSBC Innovation Banking, and charges in the Middle East. ECL in both periods reflected charges relating to the commercial real estate sector in mainland China, although they were lower in 2023.\n\nOperating expenses of $7.5bn were higher by $0.6bn on a constant currency basis. The increase reflected incremental costs in HSBC Innovation Banking of $0.3bn including the acquisition and integration of SVB UK, higher performance-related pay, ongoing investment in technology and inflationary impacts. These increases were in part mitigated by the impact of continued cost discipline and a reduction in restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022.",

This was driven by an increase in revenue of $1.5bn or 10%, notably from higher net interest income in GPS and Securities Services. ECL fell by $0.2bn, while operating expenses increased by $0.5bn or 6%.\n\nRevenue of $16.1bn was $1.5bn or 10% higher on a constant currency basis.\n\nIn Markets and Securities Services ('MSS'), revenue was marginally higher by $0.1bn or 2%.\n\n- - Securities Services revenue grew by $0.4bn or 19%, from higher net interest income as global interest rates rose.\n- - Global Debt Markets revenue increased by $0.1bn or 18%, from favourable primary market conditions and higher client trading volumes as the market environment normalised. The 2022 performance was impacted by lower primary activity and client flow due to uncertainty and challenging market conditions.\n- - Global Foreign Exchange revenue was largely in line with 2022 and reflected continued elevated client activity and trading facilitation, as we captured the benefit of market-wide volatility relating to interest rate and inflation di/fferentials.\n- - Equities revenue fell by $0.5bn or 45%, due to lower client activity as a result of reduced market volatility.\n- - Securities Financing revenue rose by $0.2bn or 22%, driven by higher client flows, growth in prime finance and the onboarding of new clients.\n\nIn Banking, revenue increased by $1.8bn or 27%.\n\n- - GPS revenue increased by $1.6bn or 56%, driven by margin growth as a result of the rising global interest rate environment and business pricing actions.\n- - Capital Markets and Advisory revenue rose by $0.3bn or 41%, primarily from increased financing activities and higher interest rates, against a backdrop of a smaller global market fee pool.\n- - Credit and Lending revenue decreased by $0.3bn or 12%, due to weaker client demand.\n- - Banking Other revenue increased by $0.2bn or 91%, from higher interest on capital held in the business.\n\nIn GBM Other, there was a $0.4bn reduction in revenue, mainly due to lower Markets Treasury allocated revenue, including disposal losses on repositioning, higher HSBC Holdings interest expense and the adverse impacts of hyperinflationary accounting.\n\nECL of $0.3bn were $0.2bn lower on a constant currency basis, reflecting a favourable credit performance, including lower charges in the commercial real estate sector in mainland China.\n\nOperating expenses of $9.9bn increased by $0.5bn or 6% on a constant currency basis due to the impact of higher inflation and strategic investments, which was in part mitigated by business actions and a reduction in restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Centre\n\nThe results of Corporate Centre primarily comprise the share of profit from our interests in our associates and joint ventures and related impairments. It also includes Central Treasury, stewardship costs and consolidation adjustments.\n\nCorporate Centre performance in 2023 reflected the recognition of an impairment in our investment in our associate BoCom. Additionally, the non-recurrence of restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022 resulted in lower operating expenses, while higher revenue included the non-recurrence of adverse fair value movements on financial instruments and the impacts of restructuring our business in Europe.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nLoss before tax of $0.4bn was $0.8bn or 65% lower than the loss in 2022, on a constant currency basis. This reflected lower restructuring and other related costs and higher revenue, partly o/ffset by the impact of an impairment of our investment in BoCom. This impairment reflects a reduction to the accounting value-in-use in line with recent market-wide developments in mainland China. For further details, see page 101.\n\nRevenue was $1.7bn or 90% higher than in 2022 on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily from the nonrecurrence of adverse fair value movements on financial instruments in Central Treasury and structural hedges, together with the nonrecurrence of losses and charges associated with the disposals of our branch operations in Greece and our French retail banking business, the planned disposal of our business in Russia, and legacy portfolios. These favourable yearon-year impacts were partly o/ffset by adverse fair value movements in 2023 on foreign exchange hedges related to the planned sale of our banking business in Canada.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by $1.9bn on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the non-recurrence of restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost-saving programme at the end of 2022. These were partly o/ffset by the recognition of a charge related to the FDIC special assessment, costs associated with the disposal of our retail banking operations in France and the planned disposal of our banking business in Canada, and a higher allocation of the UK bank levy, including adjustments related to prior years. Since 2021, the UK bank levy and any related adjustments have been allocated across our global businesses and Corporate Centre, primarily to GBM.\n\n|                                                                   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021   | 2023 vs 2022   | 2023 vs 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Results - on a constant currency basis                            | $m      | $m      | $m     | $m             | %              |\n| Net operating income                                              | (199)   | (1,898) | (678)  | 1,699          | 90             |\n| ECL                                                               | (1)     | (9)     | 3      | 8              | 89             |\n| Operating expenses                                                | 57      | (1,822) | (960)  | 1,879          | >100           |\n| Share of profit in associates and joint  ventures less impairment | (257)   | 2,574   | 2,770  | (2,831)        | >(100)         |\n| - of which: impairment loss relating   to our investment in BoCom | (3,000) | -       | -      | (3,000)        |                |\n| Profit/loss before tax                                            | (400)   | (1,155) | 1,135  | 755            | 65             |\n| RoTE (annualised) (%)                                             | (1.0)   | 2.8     |        |                |                |\n\n|                            | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | 2023 vs 2022   | 2023 vs 2022   |\n|----------------------------|--------|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Management view of revenue | $m     | $m      | $m     | $m             | %              |\n| Central Treasury 1         | 99     | ( 742)  | (324)  | 841            | >100           |\n| Legacy portfolios          | 3      | (174)   | (54)   | 177            | >100           |\n| Other 2,3                  | (301)  | (982)   | (300)  | 681            | 69             |\n| Net operating income 4     | (199)  | (1,898) | (678)  | 1,699          | 90             |\n\n| Notable items                                            | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                  |           |           |           |\n| Disposals, acquisitions and related costs                | (297)     | (525)     | -         |\n| Fair value movements on financial instruments            | 14        | (618)     | (221)     |\n| Restructuring and other related costs                    | -         | (145)     | 77        |\n| Disposal losses on Markets Treasury repositioning        | -         | -         | -         |\n| Currency translation on revenue notable items            | -         | 33        | (16)      |\n| Operating expenses                                       |           |           |           |\n| Disposals, acquisitions and related costs                | (216)     | ( 11)     | -         |\n| Restructuring and other related costs                    | 63        | (2,007)   | (1,262)   |\n| Currency translation on operating expenses notable items | -         | (22)      | 81        |\n| Impairment of interest in associate                      | (3,000)   | -         | -         |\n\nShare of profit in associates and joint ventures in 2023 included an impairment charge of $3.0bn in 2023 relating to our investment in BoCom due to a reduction of the accounting value-in-use of our investment, resulting in a\n\nloss of $0.3bn.

        "page_content": "## Risk overview\n\nActive risk management helps us to achieve our strategy, serve our customers and communities and grow our business safely.\n\n## Managing risk\n\nThe global economy proved more resilient in 2023 than had been expected, supported by strong growth in the US, and a stabilisation in China's economy, although there continues to be uncertainty and weakness in Europe. In most key markets, a fall in energy prices and other commodity prices facilitated a decrease in inflation. Central banks in most developed markets are expected to have concluded monetary policy tightening in the second half of 2023 and to start reducing interest rates in 2024. Certain emerging market central banks began reducing interest rates during 2023. However, interest rates in the medium term are likely to remain materially higher than in recent years.\n\nGeopolitical tensions are a source of significant risk, including the ongoing RussiaUkraine and Israel-Hamas wars. Both could have significant global economic and political consequences. The Israel-Hamas war has led to renewed volatility in energy prices, and recent attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the counter-measures taken to improve security have begun to disrupt supply chains. These developments have the potential to halt or reverse the recent decline in inflation especially in Europe and North America.\n\nSanctions and trade restrictions are complex, novel and evolving. In particular, the US, the UK and the EU, as well as other countries, have imposed significant sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia. In December 2023, the US established a new secondary sanctions regime, providing itself broad discretion to impose severe sanctions on non-US banks that are knowingly or even unknowingly engaged in certain transactions or services involving Russia's military-industrial base. This creates challenges associated with the detection or prevention of third-party activities beyond HSBC's control. The imposition of such sanctions against any non-US HSBC entity could result in significant adverse commercial, operational and reputational consequences for HSBC.\n\nThe relationships between China and several other countries, including the US and the UK, remain complex. Supply chains remain vulnerable to a deterioration in these relationships and this has resulted in e/fforts to de-risk certain sectors by reshoring manufacturing activities. The US, the UK, the EU and other countries have imposed various sanctions and trade restrictions on Chinese\n\n## Key risk appetite metrics\n\n| Component                              | Measure                                                                                                         | Risk  appetite   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------|\n| Capital                                | CET1 ratio - end point basis                                                                                    | \u226513.0%           | 14.8%  |\n| Change in  expected credit  losses and | Change in expected credit losses and other credit  impairment charges as a % of advances: (WPB)                 | \u22640.50%           | 0.21%  |\n| other credit  impairment  charges      | Change in expected credit losses and other credit  impairment charges as a % of advances:  wholesale (GBM, CMB) | \u22640.45%           | 0.40%  |\n\npersons and companies. The approach of countries to strategic competition and engagement with China continues to develop. In response, China has imposed sanctions, trade restrictions and law enforcement measures. Further sanctions or countersanctions may adversely a/ffect the Group, its customers and various markets.\n\nFiscal deficits are expected to remain large in both developed and emerging markets, as public spending on social welfare, defence and climate transition initiatives is expected to remain high. In many countries, the fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic has also left a very high public debt burden. Against a backdrop of slower economic growth and high interest rates, elevated borrowing costs could increase the strains on highly indebted sovereigns.\n\nPolitical changes may also have implications for policy. Many countries are expected to hold elections in 2024. This may result in uncertainty in some markets in response to domestic political priorities.\n\nSectoral risks are also a focus, and the real estate sector in particular faces challenges in many of our major markets. In mainland China, commercial real estate conditions remain distressed and signs of a material or sustained recovery are yet to emerge. Market data continues to reflect reduced investment and weak sentiment in the short term, although authorities are expanding fiscal and monetary support to the economy including specific measures to support developers and stimulate housing demand. We continue to closely monitor this sector, and take action to manage our commercial real estate portfolio risk.\n\nthe right support to customers in line with regulatory, government and wider stakeholder expectations. This follows our adoption of the UK government's Mortgage Charter released in June 2023.\n\nWe engage closely with regulators to help ensure that we continue to meet their expectations regarding financial institutions' activities to support economies during times of market volatility.\n\nOur approach to macroeconomic scenarios in relation to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' remained unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the corresponding period in 2022. Adjustments to the design and narrative of the most severe downside scenario were made to reflect increased geopolitical risks.\n\nIn addition, management adjustments to ECL were applied to reflect persisting uncertainty in certain sectors, driven by inflation, interest rate sensitivity and other macroeconomic risks, which were not fully captured by our models.\n\nWe continue to monitor, and seek to manage, the potential implications of all the above developments on our customers and our business. While the financial performance of our operations varies by geography, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong.\n\n- For further details of our Central and other scenarios, see 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 156.\n\nThe impact of the rising cost of living on retail customers is a key risk for our society. Our primary concern is to ensure that we o/ffer",

        "page_content": "## Managing risk continued\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite defines our desired forwardlooking risk profile and informs the strategic and financial planning process. It provides an objective baseline to guide strategic decision making, helping to ensure that planned business activities provide an appropriate balance of return for the risk assumed, while remaining within acceptable risk levels. Risk appetite supports senior management in allocating capital, funding and liquidity optimally to finance growth, while monitoring exposure to non-financial risks.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, our CET1 ratio and ECL charges were within their defined risk appetite thresholds. Our CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 14.8%, up 0.6 percentage points from 2022, mainly driven by capital generation net of dividends, share buy-backs and regulatory adjustments, partly o/ffset by an increase in RWAs during the year. For further details of the key drivers of the overall CET1 ratio, see 'Own funds disclosure' on page 207. Wholesale ECL charges during the year reflected the default of several mainland China commercial real estate developer clients. Wholesale ECL charges fell outside of appetite in the first half of 2023, although returned within appetite during the second half of 2023, due to relatively lower defaults in the UK and most other markets. During 2023, we enhanced the coverage of interest rate risk metrics in the banking book within the Group's appetite statement.\n\n## Stress tests\n\nWe regularly conduct stress tests to assess the resilience of our balance sheet and our capital adequacy, as well as to provide actionable insights into how key elements of our portfolios may behave during a crisis. We use the outcomes to calibrate our risk appetite to review and calibrate as required our strategic and financial plans, helping to improve the quality of management's decision making. The results from the stress tests also drive recovery and resolution planning to help enhance the Group's financial stability under various macroeconomic scenarios. The selection of stress scenarios is based upon the identification and assessment of our top risks, emerging risks and our risk appetite.\n\nIn January 2023, HSBC Holdings and HSBC UK, its UK ring-fenced bank, submitted the internally modelled results of the Bank of England's ('BoE') 2022-2023 annual cyclical scenario to the regulator. The BoE uses\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nOur top and emerging risks report identifies forward-looking risks so that they can be considered in determining whether any incremental action is needed to either prevent them from materialising or to limit their e/ffect. Top risks are those that have the potential to have a material adverse impact on the\n\nfinancial results, reputation or business model of the Group. We actively manage and take actions to mitigate our top risks. Emerging risks are those that, while they could have a material impact on our risk profile were they to occur, are not considered immediate and are not under active management.\n\nOur suite of top and emerging risks is subject to regular review by senior governance forums. During 2023, we removed Ibor transition as a top risk given the cessation of the publication of US dollar Libor in June 2023. We continue to monitor closely the identified risks and ensure management actions are in place, as required.\n\nthe annual cyclical scenario stress test to determine the banking sector's ability to withstand an adverse scenario and continue to serve UK households and businesses.\n\nThe results were published on 12 July 2023 by the BoE in its Financial Stability Report and indicated that both HSBC Holdings and HSBC UK are su/fficiently capitalised with a CET1 capital ratio remaining well above the regulatory reference rate on both an IFRS 9 transitional basis and on a non-transitional basis.\n\nDuring the second half of 2023, the Groupwide internal stress test was completed alongside testing of the Group's strategy. The concluding results of the Group-wide internal stress test provided updates to the Group Risk Committee in support of its assessment of adequacy of HSBC Holdings capital levels. The underlying conclusions drawn from this exercise will also be included in the Group internal capital adequacy assessment process ('ICAAP') in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nClimate risk relates to the financial and non-financial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy. Climate risk can impact us either directly or through our relationships with our clients. These include the potential risks arising as a result of our net zero ambition, which could lead to reputational concerns, and potential legal and/or regulatory action if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero targets.\n\nWe seek to manage climate risk across all our businesses in line with our Groupwide risk management framework and are incorporating climate considerations within our traditional risk types.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our approach to climate risk management, see 'Climate risk' on page 221.\n- For further details of our TCFD disclosures, see the 'ESG review' on page 42.\n\n## Climate stress tests\n\nTo support the requirements for assessing the impacts of climate change, we continue to develop a set of capabilities to execute climate stress testing and scenario analysis. These are used to help improve our understanding of risk exposures for managing risk and business decision making.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we ran further internal climate scenario analyses. The outcomes were used to identify challenges and opportunities to our net zero strategy, inform capital planning and risk appetite, as well as to respond to climate stress tests for regulators, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n- For further details of our approach to climate risk stress testing, see 'Insights from scenario analysis' on page 225.\n\n## Our operations\n\nWe remain committed to investing in the reliability and resilience of our IT systems and critical services, including those provided by third parties, which support all parts of our business. We do so to help protect our customers, a/ffiliates and counterparties, and to help ensure that we minimise any disruption to services. In our approach to defending against these threats, we invest in business and technical controls to help us detect, manage and recover from issues in a timely manner.\n\nWe are working to ensure that we balance the opportunity AI presents to accelerate delivery of our strategy with the need to ensure appropriate controls are in place to mitigate the associated risks. HSBC is committed to using AI ethically and responsibly. We continue to refine and embed robust and e/ffective governance and controls into our risk management processes to help meet the Group's needs and increasing regulatory expectations for when AI is both developed internally and enabled through third parties.\n\nWe continue to focus on improving the quality and timeliness of the data used to inform management decisions, and are progressing with the implementation of our strategic and regulatory change initiatives to help deliver the right outcomes for our customers, people, investors and communities.\n\n- For further details of our risk management framework and risks associated with our banking and insurance manufacturing operations, see pages 137 and 145, respectively.",

They must also specify the period covered by, and the appropriateness of, this statement.\n\nThe Directors have specified a period of three years to 31 December 2026. They are satisfied that a forward-looking assessment of the Group for this period is su/fficient to enable a reasonable statement of viability. In addition, this period is covered by the Group's stress testing programmes, and its internal projections for profitability, key capital ratios and leverage ratios. Notwithstanding this, our stress testing programmes also cover scenarios out to five years and our assessment of risks are beyond three years where appropriate (see page 140):\n\n- - This period is representative of the time horizon to consider the impact of ongoing regulatory changes in the financial services industry.\n- - Our updated business plan covers 2024 -2028.\n\nThe Board, having made appropriate enquiries, is satisfied that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, and it therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nBased upon their assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nIn making their going concern and viability assessments, the Directors have considered a wide range of detailed information relating to present and potential conditions, including projections for profitability, liquidity, capital requirements and capital resources.\n\nThe Directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group to determine its long-term viability, including those that would threaten its\n\nsolvency and liquidity. They determined that the principal risks are the Group's top and emerging risks as set out on page 38. These include geopolitical and macroeconomic risks (including geopolitical tensions and their impact on sanctions, trade restrictions and continued distressed Chinese economic activity), digitalisation and technological advances, financial crime risk and ESG risks, all of which have remained at heightened levels during 2023.\n\nThe Directors assessed that all of the top and emerging risks identified are considered to be material and, therefore, appropriate to be classified as the principal risks to be considered in the assessment of viability. They also appraised the impact that these principal risks could have on the Group's risk profile, taking account of mitigating actions planned or taken for each, and compared this with the Group's risk appetite as approved by the Board.\n\nIn carrying out their assessment of the principal risks, the Directors considered a wide range of information including:\n\n- - details of the Group's business and operating models, and strategy (see page 11);\n- - details of the Group's approach to managing risk and allocating capital;\n- - the continued validity of our existing risk management practices, liquidity monitoring process and metric assumptions, in light of the high-profile US and Swiss banking failures in the first quarter of 2023;\n- - a summary of the Group's financial position considering performance, its ability to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, liquidity funding and the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities over the period of the assessment. Notable are the risks which the Directors believe could cause the Group's future results or operations to adversely impact any of the above;\n- - enterprise risk reports, including the Group's risk appetite profile (see page 136) and top and emerging risks (see page 140);\n- - the impact on the Group due to the RussiaUkraine and Israel-Hamas wars; instability\n- in China's commercial real estate sector and strained economic and diplomatic relations between China and the US, the UK, the EU and other countries;\n- - reports and updates regarding regulatory and internal stress testing. The 2022-2023 Bank of England annual cyclical scenario stress test results were published on 12 July 2023. The stress scenario explored the potential impacts of a global economic contraction, persistently higher inflation and interest rates in advanced economies with materially increased unemployment, and a sharp fall in asset prices. Additionally during the second half of 2023, the Groupwide internal stress test was completed, which explores a prolonged global stress, depicting macroeconomic conditions that are generally more severe than that of the 2022-2023 annual cyclical scenario. The results of both these exercises indicated the Group is su/fficiently capitalised to withstand a severe but plausible adverse stress;\n- - the results of our 2023 internal climate scenario analysis exercise. The results of this exercise further demonstrate the Group is su/fficiently capitalised to withstand a severe stress. Further details of the insights from the 2023 climate scenario analysis are explained from page 225;\n- - reports and updates from management on risk-related issues selected for in-depth consideration;\n- - reports and updates on regulatory developments;\n- - legal proceedings and regulatory matters set out in Note 36 on the financial statements; and\n- - reports and updates from management on the operational resilience of the Group.\n\n## Aileen Taylor\n\nGroup Company Secretary and Chief Governance O/fficer\n\n21 February 2024",

In 2023, we provided practical guidance and training, where relevant, to our colleagues across the Group on how to identify and manage human rights risk.\n- - We were ranked as a top three bank against our competitors in 58% of our key six markets, although we still have work to do to improve our rank positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more in the Governance section on page 87.\n\n## Building inclusion and resilience\n\nOur social approach is centred around fostering inclusion and building resilience for our colleagues, our customers, and in the communities we serve.\n\nWe are building a workforce that is representative of the communities that we serve and we have targets and programmes in place to ensure fair and inclusive recruitment and to support the equitable progression of under-represented groups. We also strive to create an inclusive and accessible banking experience for all of our customers, and to help them access the finance they need without unnecessary barriers.\n\nEmployee resilience is central to our success, so we provide a wide range of resources to support colleagues' mental, physical and financial well-being, as well as training and support so that they are equipped with the skills they need to further their careers. We support customer resilience with products, services and education that build their\n\nOur purpose is: 'Opening up a world of opportunity'.\n\nOur purpose is guided by our values: we value di/fference; we succeed together; we take responsibility; and we get it done.\n\nOur approach to ESG is shaped by our purpose and values and a desire to create sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders. We collaborate and aim to build strong relationships with all of our stakeholders, which include the people who work for us, bank with us, own us, regulate us, and live in the societies we serve and on the planet we all inhabit to deliver the ESG approach.\n\n## Transition to net zero\n\nWe have continued to take steps to implement our climate ambition to become net zero in our operations and our supply chain by 2030, and align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050. In January 2024, we published our net zero transition plan, which is an important milestone in our journey to achieving our net zero ambition. The plan will help our people, customers, investors and other stakeholders to understand our long-term vision, the challenges, uncertainties and dependencies that exist, the progress we are making towards our own transition and what we plan to do in the future.\n\nIn this ESG review, we publish on-balance sheet financed emissions for thermal coal mining, in addition to other sectors we have already been reporting on, noting the challenge of evolving methodologies and data limitations. We also publish combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. We expect to iterate and mature our approach to supporting sector transitions over time. We also continue to work on improving our data management processes.\n\nWe continue to review policy implementation as we apply our policies in practice and our operationalisation of such policies continues to be enhanced. We take a risk-based approach when identifying transactions and clients to which our energy policy and thermal coal phase-out policies apply, and when reporting on relevant exposures, adopting approaches proportionate to risk and materiality.\n\nWe are also working with peers and industry bodies to help mobilise the systemic change needed to deliver action on climate change, nature and the just transition.\n\ncapabilities so that they can understand their finances and manage them e/ffectively.\n\n## Acting responsibly\n\nOur governance approach focuses on acting responsibly and recognises topics such as human rights, conduct and data integrity.\n\nOur policies and procedures help us to provide the right outcomes for customers, including those with enhanced care needs, which in 2023 took into account pressures from the increased cost of living. Customer experience is at the heart of how we operate and is measured through customer satisfaction and customer complaints.\n\nWe are continuing our journey to embed ESG principles across the organisation, including incorporating climate risks within the risk management framework, training our workforce, incorporating climate-related targets within executive scorecards, and engaging with customers and suppliers.",

        "page_content": "## How we decide what to measure\n\nWe listen to our stakeholders in a number of di/fferent ways, which we set out in more detail within the 'ESG overview' on page 14. We use the information they provide us to identify the issues that are most important to them and consequently also matter to our own business.\n\nOur ESG Committee and other relevant governance bodies regularly discuss the new and existing themes and issues that matter to our stakeholders. Our management team then uses this insight, alongside the framework of the ESG Guide (which refers to our obligations under the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide contained in Appendix C2 to The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited), and the LR9.8.6R(8) of the Financial Conduct Authority's ('FCA') Listing Rules, and other applicable laws and regulations to choose what we measure and publicly report in this ESG review. Under the ESG Guide, 'materiality' is considered to be\n\nthe threshold at which ESG issues become su/fficiently important to our investors and other stakeholders that they should be publicly reported. Our approach to materiality also considers disclosure standards and other applicable rules and regulations as part of our materiality assessment for specific ESG topics and relevant disclosures.\n\nGiven the recent developments in the ESG regulatory environment across various jurisdictions in which we operate, combined with the relative immaturity of processes, systems, data quality and controls, our focus remains on supporting a globally consistent set of mandatory sustainability standards. We aim to continue to evolve our reporting to recognise market developments, such as the International Sustainability Standard Board ('ISSB') or the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), and support the e/fforts to harmonise the disclosures. In this Annual Report and Accounts, we continue\n\nto report against the core World Economic Forum ('WEF') Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') metrics and will continue to review our approach as the regulatory landscape evolves.\n\nConsistent with the scope of financial information presented in our Annual Report and Accounts, the ESG review covers the operations of HSBC Holdings plc and its subsidiaries. Given the relative immaturity of ESG-related data and methodologies in general, we are on a journey towards improving completeness and robustness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our material ESG topics, see 'Engaging with our stakeholders and our material ESG topics' on page 15.\n- For further details of our approach to reporting, see 'Additional information' on page 439.\n\n## Our reporting around ESG\n\nWe report on ESG matters throughout our Annual Report and Accounts, including the 'ESG overview' section of the Strategic Report (pages 14 to 19), this ESG review (pages 41 to 98), and the 'Climate risk' and 'Insights from climate scenario analysis' sections of the Risk review (pages 221 to 230).

We also acknowledge that our internal processes to support ESG disclosures are in the process of being developed and currently rely on manual sourcing and categorisation of data. Certain aspects of our ESG disclosures are subject to enhanced verification and assurance procedures including the first, second and third line of defence. Assurance assists in reducing the risk of restatement, although it cannot be fully eliminated given the challenges in data, evolving methodologies and emerging standards.

We report our progress against our 2030 financed emissions targets and our wider progress towards net zero by 2050, including how we plan to engage with customers in high-emitting sectors.\n\n## Impact on reporting and financial statements\n\nWe have assessed the impact of climate risk on our balance sheet and have concluded that there is no material impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. The e/ffects of climate change are a source of uncertainty. We capture known and observable potential impacts of climate-related risks in our asset valuations and balance sheet calculations. These are considered in relevant areas of our balance sheet, including expected credit losses, classification and measurement of financial instruments, goodwill and other intangible assets; and in making the long term viability and going concern assessment. As part of assessing the impact on our financial statements we conducted scenario analysis to understand the impact of climate risk on our business (see page 65). For further details of our climate risk exposures, see page 221.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details of how management considered the impact of climate-related risks on its financial position and performance, see 'Critical estimates and judgements' on page 343.\n\n## In this section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Overview                                     | Our approach to  the transition                                | We aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, and in  our own operations and supply chain by 2030.                                                                                                                                                           | Page  45   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n|                                              | Understanding our  climate reporting                           | To achieve our climate ambition we need to be transparent on the  opportunities, challenges, related risks and progress we make.                                                                                                                                             | Page  46   |\n| Supporting our  customers                    | Sustainable finance  and investment                            | Our ability to help finance the transformation of businesses and  infrastructure is key to building a sustainable future for our customers  and society.                                                                                                                     | Page  49   |\n|                                              | Financed emissions                                             | We aim to align our financed emissions to achieve net zero by 2050  and support our clients on their transition.                                                                                                                                                             | Page  53   |\n| Embedding net  zero into the way  we operate | Net zero in our  own operations                                | Part of our ambition to be a net zero bank is to achieve net zero  carbon emissions in our operations and supply chain by 2030.                                                                                                                                              | Page  63   |\n|                                              | Managing climate risk                                          | We manage climate risk across all our businesses in line with our  Group-wide risk management framework.

        "page_content": "## Overview TCFD\n\n## Our approach to the transition\n\nThe Paris Agreement aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared with preindustrial levels. To limit the rise to 1.5\u00b0C, the global economy would need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We are working to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned phase-down of financed emissions from our portfolio.\n\nIn October 2020, we announced our ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050 and in 2021 we included the transition to net zero as one of the four key pillars of our corporate strategy.\n\nOur starting point in the transition to net zero is one of a heavy financed emissions footprint. Our history means our balance sheet is weighted towards the sectors and regions which matter the most in terms of emissions, and whose transitions are therefore key to the world's ability to reach net zero on time. This means we will have a complex transition, with markets and sectors at di/fferent starting points and moving at di/fferent speeds. However, it also provides us with an opportunity to work with our customers to help make an impact - in both the emissions challenge and the financing challenge.\n\n## Our net zero strengths\n\nWhere we believe we can best promote change\n\nOur implementation plan Embedding net zero into how we engage, operate and collaborate\n\nTransitioning industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupporting our customers\n\nEmbedding net zero into the way we operate\n\nPartnering for systemic change\n\nResponding to the challenges and opportunities presented by net zero requires us to work across HSBC to implement and embed our net zero approach, to manage associated risks, and to help sustain and grow value for our customers, our shareholders and our wider stakeholders. We want to make financing, facilitating and investment choices that can lead to a meaningful impact on emissions reduction in the real economy, not just in our portfolio. This requires engaging with our customers on their transitions to help finance decarbonisation in the sectors and geographies with the most change ahead.\n\nIn January 2024, we published our net zero transition plan. It provides an overview of our approach to net zero and the actions we are taking to help meet our ambition. It sets out how we intend to use our strengths as an organisation to help deliver a broader impact on decarbonisation, how we are working to embed net zero across key areas of our organisation, and the principles that we aim to use to guide the implementation of our approach.\n\n## Our net zero strengths\n\nWe aim to rebalance our capital deployment towards achieving net zero over the coming decades. We believe we can do this best by promoting change in three key areas that play to our strengths as an organisation: transitioning industry; catalysing the new economy; and decarbonising trade and supply chains.\n\nCatalysing the new economy\n\nDecarbonising trade and supply chains\n\n## Our implementation plan\n\nWe are working to embed net zero across our organisation. This includes embedding net zero into: the way that we support our customers, both through customer engagement and the provision of financing solutions; the way that we operate as an organisation, including risk management, policies, governance and own operations; and how we partner externally in support of systemic change. It also means focusing first on the sectors and customers with the highest emissions and transition risks, and evolving and expanding our e/fforts over time.\n\n## Our net zero principles\n\nIn implementing our approach to net zero, we aim to be guided by a set of principles which are aligned with our core values: science-based, transparent and accountable; integrating nature; and just and inclusive.\n\n- For further details of our approach to the transition, see our Net Zero Transition Plan 2024 at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-climatestrategy/our-net-zero-transition-plan.",

        "page_content": "## Understanding our climate reporting\n\nThe availability of high-quality climate-related data, transparent reporting standards and consistent methodology will play a vital role in helping deliver the economic transformation required to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C at the speed and scale that is needed. We understand that our existing data, systems, controls and processes require significant enhancements to drive e/ffective change, but we recognise the necessity to balance this with providing early transparency on climate disclosures.\n\n## Our stakeholder dependency\n\nCritical to our approach is a recognition that as a bank we cannot do this alone. Our ability to transition relies on decarbonisation in the real economy - both the supply and demand side - happening at the necessary pace. Our customers and the industries and markets we serve will need to transition e/ffectively, supported by strong government policies and regulation, and substantially scaled investment. Engagement and collaboration are therefore key to how we respond.\n\nWe acknowledge that to achieve our climate ambition we need to be transparent about the opportunities, challenges, related risks we face and progress we make. Our reporting must evolve to keep pace with market developments, and we will aim to work through challenges and seek to improve consistency across di/fferent markets. Standard setters and regulators will play a critical role. Some of the limitations and challenges that our organisation, and the wider industry, currently face with regard to climate reporting are highlighted on pages 47 to 48.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Explaining scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\nTo measure and manage our greenhouse gas emissions, we follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol global framework, which identifies three scopes of emissions. Scope 1 represents the direct emissions we create. Scope 2 represents the indirect emissions resulting from the use of electricity and energy to run a business. Scope 3 represents indirect emissions attributed to upstream and downstream activities. Our upstream activities include business travel and emissions from our supply chain including transport, distribution and waste. Our downstream activities include those related to investments and including financed emissions.\n\nUnder the protocol, scope 3 emissions are also broken down into 15 categories, of which we provide reporting emissions data for three related to upstream activities. These are: purchased goods and services (category 1); capital goods (category 2); and business travel (category 6). We also report data on downstream activities for financed emissions (category 15).\n\n- For further breakdown of our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Our analysis of financed emissions comprises 'on-balance sheet financed emissions' and 'facilitated emissions'.\n\n## Accelerating investment in Baltic o/ffshore wind energy\n\nPolish multi-energy company Orlen Group and Canadian power producer Northland Power have set up a joint venture to build the Baltic Power project - the first o/ffshore wind farm in Polish waters of the Baltic Sea.\n\nIn September 2023, we played a key role in supporting the construction and operation of 76 o/ffshore turbines when we acted as a mandated lead arranger for a $3.8bn (\u20ac4.4bn) credit facility. We helped coordinate a syndicate of 25 Polish and international financial institutions to finance the project.\n\nWith a target capacity of almost 1.2 gigawatts, the wind farm is expected to represent a significant step in reducing Poland's reliance on fossil fuels and generate enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of more than 1.5 million homes annually.",

        "page_content": "## Understanding our climate reporting continued\n\n## Keeping up-to-date with real economy progress\n\nNet zero-aligned scenarios are dynamic by nature; they are typically updated every few years to incorporate significant shifts that have occurred in the real economy. Key drivers of this include changes in the economic environment, new data on technology deployment across sectors and geographies, new policies, and increased investment in clean energy and/or in fossil fuels.\n\nThe reference scenario we have selected to date for our published 2030 targets, for on-balance sheet and facilitated emissions, is the International Energy Agency's ('IEA') NZE 2021 scenario, which is 1.5\u00b0C-aligned with limited overshoot. In September 2023, the IEA's NZE 2023 scenario was published as an update to reflect developments since 2021. As outlined in our net zero transition plan, going forwards we intend to review each updated set of 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenarios to further develop and enhance our understanding of the latest outlooks for evolving pathways to achieve net zero by 2050. This will help us to consider whether, how and when to iterate and update our approach to scenario selection and target setting, portfolio alignment, and policies to keep pace with the latest science and real-world developments. We anticipate standard setter and industry guidance on the treatment of updated scenarios in targetsetting to emerge.\n\nWe recognise that the so-called 'hard-toabate' sectors, such as cement, iron, steel and aluminium, and aviation have a large dependence on nascent technologies and the presence (or not) of enabling policies and regulations. We may consider tracking progress relative to 1.5\u00b0C-aligned ambition ranges for these sectors in the future, which could include industry-specific scenarios alongside the IEA NZE scenario.\n\n## Critical dependencies\n\nProgress in the real economy towards net zero will likely be non-linear and will depend heavily on external factors including the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npolicy and regulatory landscape, the speed of technological innovation, major economic shifts and geopolitical events. There is also a risk of government or customer net zero pledges or transition plans not turning into the necessary emissions reductions in the coming decade, or in the case of hard-to abate sectors, being pared back if technologies do not scale in time. In addition, climate science, the quality of data, and the scenarios upon which we have based our approach will change. We recognise that while we have limited control of these external dependencies, we can be clear on where we intend to focus our e/fforts to help drive meaningful change, and that we expect to iterate and mature our approach over time.\n\n## Our internal and external data challenges\n\nOur climate ambition requires us to continue to enhance our capabilities including governance, processes, systems and controls. In addition, there is a heightened need for subject matter experts for climate-related topics as well as upskilling of key colleague groups who are supporting customers through their net zero transition. We also need new sources of data, some of which may be di/fficult to assure using traditional verification techniques. This challenge, coupled with diverse external data sources and structures, further complicates data consolidation. Our internal data on customer groups used to source financial exposure and emissions data is based on credit and relationship management attributes, and is not always aligned to the data needed to analyse emissions across sector value chains. As a consequence, this can result in an inconsistent basis in our financed emissions calculations.\n\nWe continue to invest in our climate resources and skills. Our activities are underpinned by e/fforts to develop our data and analytics capabilities and to help ensure that we have the appropriate processes, systems, controls and governance in place to support our transition.\n\nWe continue to increase automation of our processes, with a particular focus on developing our ESG data capabilities to help address data gaps and improve consistency.\n\nThis includes sourcing more reliable data from external providers. We are also developing our processes, systems, controls and governance to meet the demands of future ESG reporting. Certain aspects of our reporting rely on manual sourcing and categorisation of data that is not always aligned with how our businesses are managed. We also have a dependency on emissions data from our clients. Given the manual nature of the process, enhanced verification and assurance procedures are performed on a sample basis over this reporting, including the first and second line of defence. Our climate models undergo independent review by an internal model review group, and we obtain limited assurance on our financed emissions and sustainable finance disclosures from external parties, including our external auditors.\n\n## Policy implementation\n\nWe continue to review policy implementation as we apply our policies in practice, and our operationalisation of such policies continues to be enhanced. We take a risk-based approach when identifying transactions and clients to which our energy and thermal coal phaseout policies apply, and when reporting on relevant exposures, adopting approaches proportionate to risk and materiality. This helps to focus our e/fforts on areas where we believe we can help drive meaningful change, while taking into account experience from policy implementation over time.\n\n## An evolving approach to embedding net zero\n\nWe acknowledge that our assessment of client transition plans - which to date has focused on clients in scope of our thermal coal phase-out and energy policies - is at an early stage with initial learnings on methodology and client engagement. We are also at the early stages of embedding transition plans alongside financed emissions into transaction and portfolio level business and risk processes. Our net zero transition plan provides further details of work underway and planned.\n\n## Limited alignment on sustainable finance taxonomies\n\nSustainable finance metrics, taxonomies and best practices lack global consistency. As standards develop over time and as the regulatory guidance around them evolves across jurisdictions, our methodologies, disclosures and targets may need to evolve. This could lead to di/fferences in year-on-year reporting and restatements.\n\nWe continue to engage with standard setters in di/fferent regions to support the development of transparent and consistent taxonomies to best incentivise science-based decarbonisation, particularly in high transition risk sectors. We aim to align to enhanced industry standards as they are further developed, and increase transparency across the di/fferent types of green and sustainable finance and investment categories going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Understanding our climate reporting continued\n\n## Financed emissions reporting challenges\n\nThe methodologies and data used to assess financed emissions and set targets continue to evolve alongside changes to industry guidance, market practice and regulation. We plan to refine our analysis using appropriate data sources and current methodologies available for the sectors we analyse. We have developed an internal recalculation policy (see page 56) to define the circumstances under which a recalculating of financed emissions is necessary to help support the consistency, comparability and relevance of our reported emissions data over time.\n\nWe have now set combined on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions targets for two emissions-intensive sectors: oil and gas, and power and utilities, and report the combined progress for both sectors. We continue to report on-balance sheet financed emissions and targets for cement, iron, steel and aluminium, aviation, automotive and in 2023 we added thermal coal mining financed emissions.\n\nEmissions related to our insurance business are partially captured within the disclosures of HSBC Asset Management, which manages the vast majority of our insurance assets. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ('PCAF') standard for insurance associated emissions (part C) is not applicable to our insurance business as HSBC Insurance focuses on the manufacturing of life insurance products.\n\nIn November 2023, our asset management business updated its 2022 thermal coal phase-out policy and released a new energy policy. It continues to focus on its portfolios' scope 1 and scope 2 decarbonisation target for 2030 with the aim of aligning with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. The commitment covers listed equity and corporate fixed income where data is most reliable and methodologies are most mature.\n\nIn January 2023, we withdrew our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi'), which we had made in 2016, because we determined that it would not be feasible for us to meet SBTi's requirement to submit a complete set of sector targets for validation by its deadline. We continue to engage with SBTi on guidance for financial institutions and we participated in SBTi's consultation process on its revised standards during the year.\n\n## Disclosure revisions\n\nWe are committed to timely and transparent reporting. However, we recognise that challenges on data sourcing, as well as the evolution of our processes and industry standards, may result in us having to restate\n\ncertain disclosures. In 2023, there has been an impact on certain climate disclosures, as follows:\n\n- - Financed emissions: we improved our methodology for calculating financed emissions using more granular product identification to isolate exposure in scope, more consistent emission factors for estimates, and a revised aggregation method for emission intensity. Previously reported onbalance sheet numbers included non-lending exposures for market products in error. The more granular product identification will help ensure these are not included in future.\n- - Financed emissions: to reflect these enhancements we have set out the recalculated metrics for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors in the financed emissions section. The oil and gas baseline for on-balance sheet financed emissions is now 28.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ('Mt CO 2 e') for 2019 versus 33.0 Mt CO 2 e reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. The power and utilities baseline for on-balance sheet financed emissions is now 537.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt hour ('tCO 2 e/ GWh') for 2019 versus 589.9 tCO 2 e/GWh reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. For other sectors, changes were not material enough to warrant a recalculation.\n- - Thermal coal exposures: we have now revised the basis of preparation for our thermal coal exposures. Aligned with our thermal coal phase-out policy, we applied a risk-based approach to identify clients and report on relevant exposures. Our thermal coal financing drawn balance exposure was approximately $1bn \u2020 as at 31 December 2020. We continue to work on our 2021 and 2022 numbers based on our revised basis of preparation and expect to report on these in future disclosures.\n- - Thermal coal power financed emissions: we have discontinued separate tracking and reporting of thermal coal power financed emissions. A review of the counterparties included within the on-balance sheet financed emissions calculation showed that the majority of thermal coal power entities in scope are included in other financed emission sector targets. We previously set separate targets to reduce on-balance sheet financed emissions for thermal coal power and thermal coal mining aligned to our thermal coal phase-out policy. We plan to maintain a financed emissions target for thermal coal mining only, and have set an absolute on-balance sheet reduction target for 2030 from a 2020 baseline. We used 2020 as a baseline to align with those applied to our drawn balance exposure targets. These targets reflect the percentage reduction that the IEA indicates in its net zero emissions scenario for global emissions to 2030.\n\n## Continuing to evolve our climate disclosures\n\nWe understand the need to provide early transparency on climate disclosures but we must balance this with the recognition that our existing data and reporting processes require significant enhancements. Due to ongoing data availability and quality challenges, we continue to assess our financed emissions for our real estate and agriculture sectors.\n\nWe are engaging with standard setters to support the development of transparent and consistent climate-related industry standards in areas such as product labelling, sustainability disclosures, sustainable finance taxonomy and emissions accounting. Voluntary industry initiatives can also help shape action and collaboration, and often form the basis of future climate policy and regulation. For example, we supported the TCFD, which is now referenced in climate disclosure rules around the world.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue to review our approach to disclosures, and enhance as appropriate.\n\n- - Shipping: following a reduction in our exposure to the shipping sector after the strategic sale of part of our European shipping portfolio in 2023, and work undertaken to assess the materiality of our remaining portfolio from a financed emissions perspective, we have concluded that the remaining exposure as of year-end 2023 is not material enough to warrant setting a stand-alone target. This aligns with Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA') guidelines on sector inclusion for target setting.\n- For details of assurance over our ESG data, see page 43.\n- For details of our approach to calculating financed emissions and the relevant data and methodology limitations, see page 55.\n- For details of our sustainable finance and investment ambition, see page 49.\n- For details of our approach to thermal coal financing exposures, see page 67.\n- For further details of our asset management policies, see page 67.\n- \u2020  Data is subject to independent limited assurance by PwC in accordance with ISAE 3000/ ISAE 3410.

Our sustainable finance and investment ambition aims to help promote green, sustainable and socially-focused business and sustainable investment products and solutions.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, we have provided and facilitated $267.8bn of sustainable finance and $26.6bn of ESG and sustainable investing, as defined in our Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary 2023. This included 38% where the use of proceeds were dedicated to green financing, 12% to social financing, and 15% to other sustainable financing. It also included 26% of sustainability-linked financing and 9% of net new investment flows managed and distributed on behalf of investors. In 2023, our underwriting of green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds for clients decreased over the year, measured on a proportional share basis, in line with the wider bond market environment, although it remained at 15% of our total bond underwriting. On-balance sheet sustainable\n\nlending transactions increased by 7% compared with 2022. In 2023, transactions totalling $0.7bn were identified as no longer fulfilling our eligibility criteria. These were declassified and removed from the cumulative progress total, and reported as a negative entry in 2023.\n\nContinued progress towards achieving our sustainable finance and investment ambition is dependent on market demand for the products and services set out in our Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary 2023.\n\n| Sustainable finance and investment summary 1               | 2023  ($bn)   | 2022   ($bn)   | 2021   ($bn)   | 2020   ($bn)   | Cumulative progress  since 2020 ($bn)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Balance sheet-related transactions provided                | 42.7          | 42.2           | 26.0           | 10.4           | 121.3                                   |\n| Capital markets/advisory (facilitated)                     | 33.3          | 34.5           | 48.7           | 30.0           | 146.5                                   |\n| ESG and sustainable investing (net new flows)              | 7.7           | 7.5            | 7.7            | 3.7            | 26.6                                    |\n| Total contribution 2                                       | 83.7          | 84.2           | 82.4           | 44.1           | 294.4                                   |\n| Sustainable finance and investment classification by theme |               |                |                |                |                                         |\n| Green use of proceeds 3,4                                  | 37.1          | 29.0           | 27.1           | 18.9           | 112.1                                   |\n| Social use of proceeds 3                                   | 8.4           | 6.7            | 11.3           | 9.7            | 36.1                                    |\n| Other sustainable use of proceeds 3,5                      | 10.7          | 12.6           | 11.7           | 8.3            | 43.3                                    |\n| Sustainability-linked 6                                    | 19.8          | 28.4           | 24.6           | 3.5            | 76.3                                    |\n| ESG and sustainable investing 7                            | 7.7           | 7.5            | 7.7            | 3.7            | 26.6                                    |\n| Total contribution 2,8                                     | 83.7          | 84.2           | 82.4           | 44.1           | 294.4                                   |",

This involves reviewing and strengthening our product definitions, where appropriate, adding and deleting qualifying products, making enhancements to our internal standards, and developing our reporting and governance.\n\nIndustry and regulatory guidance on definitions for sustainable finance continue to evolve. In 2023, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ('GFANZ'), NZBA and the UK government released work-inprogress definitions of transition finance. We will continue to monitor these and other developments in sustainable finance definitions.\n\nOur progress will be published each year, and we will seek to continue for it to be independently assured.\n\n## Mobilising capital to support our customers\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on providing our customers with products, services and initiatives to help enable emissions reduction in the real economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor example, we increased our funding from $5bn to $9bn for our sustainable finance scheme that supports businesses of all sizes in China's Greater Bay Area to transition to low-carbon operations. The scheme, launched in 2022, provides successful loan applicants access to a range of additional services including training, subsidised third-party assessments and assistance from a team with sustainable financing expertise. For our Wealth and Personal Banking customers, we launched green mortgages in Mexico, electric vehicle loans in India and a referral service to our electric vehicle leasing partner in the UK.\n\nIn 2023, we introduced an internal briefing series called Net Zero in Practice, which covers new technologies relevant to the net zero transition, drawing on expertise from across the organisation and highlighting financing opportunities and case studies.\n\nWe continue to be a participant in the Just Energy Transition Partnerships ('JETPs') in Indonesia and Vietnam, and in the Nexus for Water, Food and Energy in Egypt. These initiatives aim to play a catalytic role in mobilising finance to accelerate the energy transition. For further details of our involvement with the JETPs, see page 68.\n\n## Our sustainable finance and investment data dictionary\n\nWe define sustainable finance and investment as any form of financial service that integrates ESG criteria into business or investment decisions. This includes financing, investing and advisory activities that support the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs'), including but not limited to the aims of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nDetails of our revised definitions of the contributing activities for sustainable finance and investment and how we calculate the amounts we count are available in our Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor our ESG Data Pack and Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary, see www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ esg-and-responsible-business/esgreporting-centre.\n\nIn 2023, we won three awards at the Environmental Finance Bond Awards. We retained the Euromoney award for Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia for the sixth year in a row, and won the global award for Best Bank for Public Sector Clients in recognition of our innovation in sustainability and tokenised public-sector bonds.\n\n## Developing sustainable food supply chains in south-east Asia\n\nSingapore-based Glife Technologies has developed a digital business-to-business foodsourcing platform that connects farmers from marginalised communities in south-east Asia to the hospitality industry.\n\nThe distribution network, served by an app, aims to improve the e/fficiency and sustainability of supply chains by aggregating orders and sourcing in bulk direct from farmers, in order to help control costs and reduce the risk of food waste from damage or contamination.\n\nIn June 2023, we provided a working capital loan and access to our cross-border network to help Glife expand its platform into new markets, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The loan also aims to help Glife finance social projects seeking to improve food security and creating more sustainable food systems. The loan was drawn from HSBC's New Economy fund, which is dedicated to investing in high-growth, pre-profit new economy businesses in Singapore.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable finance and investment continued\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nWe o/ffer a broad suite of ESG capabilities across asset management, global markets, wealth, private banking and securities services, to help institutional and individual investors to generate financial returns, manage risk and pursue ESG-related opportunities.\n\nOur Asset Management business is committed to further developing our sustainable product range across asset classes, as well as enhancing our existing product suite for ESG and climate-related criteria where it is in the investors' interests to do so. In 2023, we launched 10 funds within our ESG and sustainable strategies, which adhere to, and are classified within, our Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary 2023.\n\nHSBC Asset Management managed over $684bn assets at the end of 2023, of which $73.3bn comprise assets of funds and mandates invested in our ESG and sustainable strategies.\n\nOur ESG and sustainable investing approach across di/fferent investment products can include but is not limited to the UN SDGs, including climate. For the avoidance of doubt, assets invested pursuant to, or considered to be in alignment with, HSBC's ESG and sustainable investing approach do not necessarily qualify as 'sustainable investments' as defined by the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation ('SFDR') or other relevant regulations. Our ESG and sustainable investing approach is an HSBC internal classification approach used to establish our own ESG and sustainable investing criteria (recognising the subjectivity inherent in such an approach and the variables involved). It is also used to promote consistency across asset classes and business lines where relevant, and should not be relied on externally to assess the sustainability characteristics of any given product. There is no single global standard definition of, or measurement criteria for, ESG and sustainable investing or the impact of ESG and sustainable investing products.\n\nWe seek to take an active stewardship role to help drive positive change in the companies on our priority list in which we invest on behalf of our customers. The priority list, which is defined in our Global Stewardship Plan, can be found at: www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/ en/institutional-investor/about-us/responsibleinvesting/-/media/files/attachments/uk/ policies/stewardship-plan-uk.pdf.\n\nHSBC Asset Management's fixed income, equity and stewardship teams held over 2,000 meetings with companies in its portfolios. This included engaging with companies on the priority list across several thematic priorities, such as climate change, human rights, public health, inclusive growth and shared prosperity, biodiversity and nature, trusted technology and data, and diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nFor our private banking and wealth customers, we expanded our investment o/ffering with the launch of eight ESG and sustainable investing mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in 2023. We also enhanced our ESG and sustainable investing structured products o/ffering linked to indices such as the MSCI World Islamic ESG Select 8% Risk Control Index. Throughout 2023, we published regular ESG and sustainability-related market insights and updates such as #WhyESGMatters and Learning about ESG to help clients better understand the implications for their investments.\n\nHSBC Life, our insurance business, continues to expand the availability of ESG investment fund options within its investment-linked products. In 2023, eight new ESG funds were introduced across Hong Kong, France and Singapore with a range of investment themes, including environmental, circular economy and sustainable energy.\n\nIn June, under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative ('UNEP FI') Principles for Sustainable Insurance, HSBC Life co-led a team of insurance organisations to publish an industry position paper focused on the role and opportunity for life and health insurers to help build a more inclusive and preventative healthcare model. This included examples of good industry practice to: help insurers improve access to healthcare; close the health protection gap; drive better health outcomes across populations; and mitigate potential health risks due to climate change and other environmental factors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our asset management policies, see page 67.\n\n## Helping customers to understand ESG in their investments\n\nWe have launched new metrics to help our Global Private Banking and Wealth customers understand the ESG performance of their investments. In selected markets in 2023, we also introduced a sustainability preference questionnaire to help identify and understand our customers' sustainable investing objectives and ambitions. By improving clarity on ESG performance, which traditional financial metrics fail to capture, we aim to provide customers with meaningful insights to enable them to make informed investment decisions. Examples of these metrics, available on digital platforms in selected markets, are:\n\n- - 'ESG rating and score', which measures a company's resilience to material long-term, industry ESG risks and opportunities, with data provided by MSCI.\n- - 'Carbon intensity', which measures a company's carbon emissions per million of revenue, with data provided by S&P Trucost.\n\nIn addition, we have also introduced 'HSBC ESG and sustainable investing classifications', which help customers to understand and identify ESG and sustainable investing products in their investment portfolio according to HSBC's definition.",

In 2023, the initiative, which aims to mobilise large-scale financing to develop sustainable infrastructure, invited pilot photovoltaic and wind power projects around the world to apply for the provisional FASTInfra label. The label is awarded to projects that meet specific sustainability criteria. HSBC is supporting the introduction and widespread adoption of the labelling system as a standard for sustainable infrastructure assets globally.\n\nLabel applicants included a solar photovoltaic project submitted by Pentagreen Capital, our sustainable infrastructure debt financing partnership with Singapore-based investment firm Temasek. The project sponsor was Citicore Solar Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of the Philippines-focused renewable energy developer and operator Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation. Pentagreen acted as lead arranger of a $100m green loan facility and committed an initial $30m to help fund Citicore's development of six solar power projects capable of generating 490 megawatts of electricity for the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The commitment marks Pentagreen's first investment in the construction of ready-to-build clean energy projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the World Bank Group issued HSBC Holdings a guarantee of $1.8bn in regulatory capital relief on mandatory reserves held by its subsidiary in Mexico. The benefits of the capital relief are expected to be deployed to exclusively support eligible climate finance projects in Mexico, including renewable energy, energy e/fficiency, clean transportation and sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe HSBC Alternatives business, part of HSBC Asset Management, continued to develop its energy transition infrastructure capabilities in Asia, targeting investments in renewable energy generation, storage, grids, charging and hydrogen infrastructure. To help support the transition to green energy in North Asia, the energy transition infrastructure strategy made its first investment in solar photovoltaic power project developer Tekoma Energy.\n\n## Natural capital as an emerging asset class\n\nClimate Asset Management, a joint venture we launched with climate investment and advisory firm Pollination in 2020, continues to create investment opportunities for investors to help protect biodiversity and support the transition to net zero.\n\nIt o/ffers two investment strategies that aim to build resilience across landscapes while generating returns. Its nature-based carbon strategy targets nature restoration and conservation projects in developing economies, prioritising community benefits while generating high-quality carbon credits. Its natural capital strategy invests in agriculture, forestry and environmental assets and aims to deliver impact at scale alongside long-term financial returns.\n\nOn behalf of these strategies in 2023, Climate Asset Management allocated more than $400m to projects in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Spain, Australia and Portugal.\n\n## Backing new technology and innovation\n\nAt the COP28 Summit in the UAE, HSBC pledged its support for the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing Platform, which aims to scale up the development of renewable energy projects in developing countries. Established in 2021 with initial support from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and the International Renewable Energy Agency, the platform brings together public and private institutions. HSBC signed alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. We will work with platform partners to expand the pipeline of investable projects in core HSBC markets, including in Asia and the Middle East, bringing financing solutions that support the transition to net zero.\n\nWe also became a founding member of the Global Climate Finance Centre, a newly launched UAE-based think tank created to connect public and private finance to help accelerate the transition to net zero.\n\nHSBC Alternatives made direct investments in assets that help to promote the transition to a net zero climate. The venture capital strategy invests across four themes: power transformation, transport electrification, supply chain sustainability and climate risk mitigation. The strategy raised additional funds from institutional and private wealth clients over the course of 2023. As of 31 December 2023, the strategy had deployed capital into eight start-up companies. These included US-based Electric Era, which provides electric vehicle fast-charging technology, and Israel-based SeeTree, which has developed a software platform that tracks the health and productivity of trees.",

We have published initial financed emissions targets for 2030, and plan to review them in five-year increments thereafter.\n\nOur analysis of financed emissions comprises 'on-balance sheet financed emissions' and 'facilitated emissions', which we distinguish where necessary in our reporting. Our onbalance sheet financed emissions include emissions related to on-balance sheet lending, such as project finance and direct lending. Our facilitated emissions include emissions related to financing we help clients to raise through capital markets activities. Our analysis covers financing from Global Banking and Markets, and Commercial Banking.\n\nFinanced emissions link the financing we provide to our customers and their activities in the real economy, and provide an indication of the associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey form part of our scope 3 emissions, which include emissions associated with the use of a company's products and services.\n\nIn 2021, we started measuring financed emissions for oil and gas, and power and utilities. Following the December 2023 release of the PCAF Global GHG Accounting Standard for capital markets, we now include facilitated emissions for these sectors, in recognition of our role as service provider when customers issue debt and equity to investors. For target setting we now track the combined progress for on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions.\n\nIn 2022, we disclosed the on-balance sheet financed emissions targets for the following additional sectors: cement; iron, steel and aluminium; aviation; and automotive. We also set a target, and now measure, on-balance sheet financed emissions for the thermal coal mining sector. As part of our financial reporting, we present the progress for these sectors\n\n## Our approach to financed emissions\n\nIn our approach to assessing our financed emissions, our key methodological decisions were shaped in line with industry practices and standards. We recognise these are still developing.\n\n## Coverage of our analysis\n\nFor each sector, our analysis focuses on the parts of the value chain where we believe the majority of emissions are produced to help reduce double counting of emissions. By estimating emissions and setting targets for customers that directly account for, or indirectly influence, the majority of emissions in each\n\nindustry, we can focus our engagement and resources where we believe the potential for change is highest. For each sector, our reported emissions now typically include all the major greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, among others. These are reported as tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, in line with NZBA guidelines.\n\nTo calculate annual on-balance sheet financed emissions, we use drawn balances as at 31 December in the year of analysis related to wholesale credit and lending, which include business loans and project finance as the\n\nagainst the financed emissions baselines that we now measure ourselves against.\n\nFollowing a reduction in our exposure to the shipping sector after the strategic sale of part of our European shipping portfolio in 2023, and work undertaken to assess the materiality of our remaining portfolio from a financed emissions perspective, we have concluded that the remaining exposure as of year-end 2023 is not material enough to warrant setting a stand-alone target. This aligns with NZBA guidelines on sector inclusion for target setting.\n\nWe have announced a number of planned business disposals in recent years, and we will continue to consider how these may impact future disclosures, including recalculations.\n\nFor all sectors other than oil and gas and thermal coal mining, we have set emissions intensity targets. These targets are linked to real world production and help us to deploy capital towards decarbonisation solutions.\n\nvalue of finance provided to customers. We excluded products that were short term by design, and typically less than 12 months in duration, consistent with guidance from the PCAF, to reduce volatility. For facilitated emissions we considered all capital market transactions in scope for the year of analysis. These included debt and equity capital markets, and syndicated loans.\n\n- For further details of our financed emissions methodology, exclusions, and limitations, see our Financed Emissions and Thermal Coal Exposures Methodology at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ esg-and-responsible-business/esg-reportingcentre.\n\nThe chart below shows the scope of our financed emissions analysis of the seven sectors, including upstream, midstream and downstream activities within each sector. The allocation of companies to di/fferent parts of the value chain is highly dependent on expert judgement and data available on company revenue streams. As data quality improves, this will be further refined.\n\n| Sector                     | Scope of emissions                       | Value chain in scope                        | Value chain in scope                            | Value chain in scope       | Value chain in scope                              | Coverage of greenhouse  gases ('GHGs')   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas                | 1, 2 and 3                               | Upstream  (e.g. extraction)                 | Midstream (e.g. transport)                      | Downstream (e.g. fuel use) | Integrated/  diversified                          | All GHGs                                 |\n| Power and utilities        | 1 and 2                                  | Upstream   (e.g. generation)                | Midstream (e.g. transmission  and distribution) |                            | Downstream (e.g. retail)                          | All GHGs                                 |\n| Iron, steel and  aluminium | 1 and 2                                  | Upstream (e.g. raw   materials, extraction) | Midstream (e.g. ore to steel)                   |                            | Downstream (e.g. construction)                    | All GHGs                                 |\n| Aviation                   | 1 for airlines,   3 for aircraft lessors | Upstream (e.g. parts manufacturers)         | Midstream  (e.g. aircraft manufacturing)        |                            | Downstream (e.g. airlines and air lessors)        | All GHGs                                 |\n| Automotive                 | 1, 2 and 3                               | Upstream (e.g. suppliers)                   | Midstream  (e.g. motor vehicle  manufacture)    |                            | Downstream (e.g. retail) Downstream (e.g. retail) | All GHGs All GHGs                        |\n| Thermal coal mining        | 1, 2 and 3                               | Upstream   (e.g. extraction)                | Midstream (e.g. processing)                     |                            |                                                   |                                          |\n\nKey:  Included in analysis",

        "page_content": "## Financed emissions continued\n\n## Setting our targets\n\nOur target-setting approach to date, for on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions, has been to utilise a single net zero reference scenario (IEA NZE 2021) to underpin both energy supply-related sectors (oil and gas, power and utilities, and thermal coal mining) and our published targets for demand-side sectors in transport and heavy industry.\n\nThe impact of our capital markets activities is now reflected in our combined financed emissions targets for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. Our facilitated emissions, included in our combined metrics, are weighted at 33%, in accordance with the PCAF standard. This approach dampens volatility, apportions responsibility between underwriters and asset owners, and allows for flexibility in deploying on and o/ff-balance sheet financing in line with clients' needs. To further reduce the inherent volatility in facilitated emissions, we apply a three-year moving average across transactions for our target metric, building up from 2019 data. This means that transactions facilitated in 2028 and 2029 will still have an impact on the 2030 progress number and will need to be taken into consideration as we manage progress towards our target. We aim to achieve our target in 2030 notwithstanding the application of a three-year average.\n\nOur approach for financed emissions accounting does not rely on purchasing o/ffsets to achieve any financed emissions targets we set.\n\n## An evolving approach\n\nWe believe methodologies for calculating financed emissions and setting targets should be transparent and comparable, and should provide science-based insights that focus engagement e/fforts, inform capital allocation and support the development of solutions that are both timely and impactful. We continue to engage with regulators, standard setters and industry bodies to help shape our approach to measuring financed emissions and managing portfolio alignment to net zero. We also work with data providers and our clients to help us gather data from the real economy to improve our analysis.\n\nScenarios used in our analysis are modelled on assumptions of the available carbon budget and actions that need to be taken to limit the long-term increase in average global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C with limited overshoot. We expect that the scenarios we use will be updated periodically. We plan to refine our own analysis of financed emissions as industry guidance on scenarios, data and methodologies more broadly evolve in the years ahead.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nFor the agriculture sector, due to ongoing data availability and quality challenges, and lack of developed methodologies, we are not in a position to report our financed emissions or set a target at this time. We aim to build data availability and continue to work with partners and industry bodies to develop data and methodologies across a wider section of the agriculture value chain - such as farmrelated and downstream emissions, including from the food and beverage sector - while assessing the make-up of our portfolio.\n\n## Residential real estate\n\nFor residential real estate, where our customers are consumers not corporates, our approach needs to consider financial inclusivity, and our ability to provide customers access to suitable mortgages in addition to decarbonisation aims. We expect to measure and report our residential real estate financed emissions in future disclosures. We continue to consider our approach to setting an appropriate target to measure our contribution to helping the sector transition.\n\n## Commercial real estate\n\nFor commercial real estate, we continue to work towards outlining a baseline and a 2030 financed emissions ambition or ambition range, starting with our major markets and where su/fficient data is available to track decarbonisation progress. We expect to review our approach and coverage periodically in line with evolving data, methodologies, scenarios and real-world progress. Methodologies for embedded carbon need to be developed given the materiality of financing new property development within our portfolio, from a financed emissions perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in battery health and monitoring solutions\n\nThe global push towards electrification is accelerating the demand for systems powered by safe, reliable and sustainable batteries.\n\nIn August 2023, HSBC Asset Management, as part of its climate tech venture capital strategy, helped a Germany-based analytics software startup secure $7.8m (\u20ac7.2m) of investment in its battery monitoring platform, with HSBC Asset Management's fund providing $4.1m (\u20ac3.8m).\n\nACCURE Battery Intelligence uses AI, field data and modelling to forecast and manage the health and performance of batteries, and predict failures, fires and other incidents. With their software already supporting 3.5 gigawatt-hours of storage, the fundraising will help expand and develop the platform across energy, electric vehicle, transit, marine, insurance and other industries worldwide.",

        "page_content": "## Financed emissions continued\n\n## Data and methodology limitations\n\nOur financed emissions estimates and methodological choices are shaped by the availability of data for the sectors we analyse.\n\n- - We are members of the PCAF, which defines and develops greenhouse gas accounting standards for financial institutions. Its Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standards for Financed Emissions and for Facilitated Emissions provide detailed methodological guidance to measure and disclose financed and facilitated emissions.\n- - We have found that data quality scores vary across the di/fferent sectors and years of our analysis, although not significantly. While we expect our data quality scores to improve over time, as companies continue to expand their disclosures to meet growing regulatory and stakeholder expectations, there may be fluctuations within sectors year on year, and/or di/fferences in the data quality scores between sectors due to changes in data availability.\n- - The majority of our clients do not yet report the full scope of greenhouse gas emissions included in our analysis, in particular scope 3 emissions. In the absence of client-reported emissions, we estimated emissions using proxies based on company production and revenue figures. Although we sought to minimise the use of non-company-specific data, we applied industry averages in our analysis where company-specific data was unavailable through our vendor datasets. As data improves, estimates will be replaced with reported figures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Third-party datasets that feed into our analysis may have up to a two-year lag in reported emissions figures, and we are working with data providers to help reduce this. Mapping external datasets to our internal client entities is challenging due to complex company ownership structures.\n- - The methodology and data used to assess financed emissions and set targets are new and evolving, and we expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations to continue to change. We plan to refine our analysis using appropriate data sources and current methodologies available for the sectors we analyse.\n- - We remain conscious that the attribution factor used in the financed emissions calculation is sensitive to changes in drawn amounts or market fluctuations, and we plan to be transparent around drivers for change to portfolio financed emissions where possible.\n- - To calculate sector-level baselines and annual updates, our portfolio-level emissions intensity was previously weighted by the ratio of our financing in relation to the value of the financed company. We believe this introduced volatility. We have now calculated sector level emissions intensity metrics using a portfolio-weighted approach. Due to data limitations, we are unable to obtain production data for all of our clients. We therefore calculate an emissions intensity figure using the 75th percentile to meet this data gap.\n- - The classification of our clients into sectors is performed with inputs from subject matter experts, and will also continue to evolve with improvements to data and our sector classification approach. Our internal data on customer groups used to source financial exposure and emissions data is based on credit and relationship management attributes and is not always aligned to the data needed to analyse emissions across sector value chains. As a consequence, this can result in an inconsistent basis in our financed emissions calculations. As the sub-sector, and therefore the value chain classification is based on judgement, this may be revised as better data becomes available. Emissions are calculated at a counterparty group level and each client is mapped to a single sector. Companies with multiple activities such as conglomerates, with near to equal business activity split across multiple sectors, are excluded as these can have di/fferent activities covered by multiple sector targets. Once we define a methodology for conglomerates these may be covered according to their activity split.\n- - The operating environment for climate analysis and portfolio alignment is maturing. We continue to work to improve our data management processes, and are implementing steering mechanisms to align our provision of finance with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n- For further details of our financed emissions methodology, see our Financed Emissions and Thermal Coal Exposures Methodology at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/esg-reporting-centre.\n\n## Tackling operational emissions in industry\n\nWe are supporting one of the largest producers of textile raw materials in Indonesia to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. PT. Indo-Rama Synthetics Tbk, which specialises in the integrated production of spun yarn and polyester, wanted to expand its operations and meet its customer demand in a sustainable way.\n\nTo help PT. Indo-Rama Synthetics Tbk invest in reducing energy consumption, we provided a $20m green loan in September 2023 so that it can install energy e/fficient machinery and technology in the expansion of its yarn spinning factory.",

To adhere to this recommendation, we have defined the circumstances under which we consider a recalculation of baseline and/or progress against financed emissions target metrics is necessary to help ensure the consistency, comparability and relevance of the reported greenhouse gas emissions data\n\nover time. Our recalculation policy covers revisions of metrics linked to the targets due to changes in financed emissions accounting, such as changes to methodology, errors, and improvements to data. We expect our recalculation policy to evolve with further industry guidance.\n\nThe table below outlines the action we take when key areas of change, individually or in aggregate, breach our defined significance thresholds for the baseline year metric linked\n\n| Key reasons for change                                                                       | What we expect to disclose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes to the financed  emissions methodology such as  changes to design choices            | - The reasons why applying the new metrics provides reliable and more relevant information - The actions being taken to remediate same or similar errors in the future - The nature of the change(s) and errors in financed emissions accounting impacting the baseline progress  metric and all prior year progress metrics disclosed as far as is practicable |\n| Errors such as a failure to carry  out our methodology or errors in  internal financial data | - The aggregate amount of any adjustments impacting the baseline progress metric and all prior year  progress metrics disclosed as far as is practicable - The change in financed emissions accounting baseline progress metric and all prior year progress metrics                                                                                             |\n\nIn 2023, we improved our methodology for calculating financed emissions using more granular product identification to isolate exposure in scope, more consistent emission factors for estimates, and a revised aggregation method for emissions intensity. Previously some reported on-balance sheet numbers included non-lending exposures for market products in error. The more granular product identification will help ensure these are not included in future.\n\nTo reflect these enhancements we have set out the recalculated metrics for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors in the table below. For other sectors, changes were not material enough to warrant a recalculation.\n\nThe oil and gas baseline for on-balance sheet financed emissions is now 28.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ('Mt CO 2 e') for 2019 versus 33.0 Mt CO 2 e reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. Of this change, 62% (2.9 Mt CO 2 e) was related to the inclusion of non-lending products in error\n\nand the remaining 38% (1.8 Mt CO 2 e) was due to the enhanced product mapping and streamlined approach for emissions estimates.\n\nThe power and utilities baseline for on-balance sheet financed emissions is now 537.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt hour ('tCO 2 e/GWh') for 2019 versus 589.9 tCO 2 e/GWh reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022. This change reflects the implementation of the revised aggregation method and enhanced product mapping.\n\n| Revisions           |                                            |   Previously reported | Previously reported   |   Recalculated metrics | Recalculated metrics   | Percentage change   | Percentage change   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Sector              | Reporting metrics                          |                2019   | 2020                  |                 2019   | 2020                   | 2019                | 2020                |\n| Oil and gas         | On-balance sheet financed - Mt CO 2 e      |                  33   | 30.1                  |                   28.4 | 25.0                   | (14)%               | (17)%               |\n|                     | Facilitated (100% weighting) - Mt CO 2 e   |                  29.5 | N/A                   |                   43.2 | N/A                    | 47%                 | N/A                 |\n| Power and utilities | On-balance sheet financed - tCO 2 e/GWh    |                 589.9 | 509.6                 |                  537.5 | 511.1                  | (9)%                | -%                  |\n|                     | Facilitated (100% weighting) - tCO 2 e/GWh |                 360   | N/A                   |                  420.7 | N/A                    | 17%                 | N/A                 |\n\nto the target.

These show the revised baselines.\n\nFor facilitated emissions, we track progress to target using a three-year average moving window (average of 2020, 2021 and 2022 for the 2022 progress number) and figures weighted at 33%. This means that transactions facilitated in 2028 and 2029 will still have an impact on the 2030 progress number and will need to be taken into consideration as we manage progress towards our target. We aim to achieve our target in 2030 notwithstanding the application of a three-year average.\n\nThe facilitated emissions values total 17.5 Mt CO 2 e in 2021 and 14.4 Mt CO 2 e in 2022 for the oil and gas sector, and 398.3 tCO 2 e/GWh for 2021 and 377.6 tCO 2 e/GWh in 2022 for the power and utilities sector. These values are then combined with the on-balance sheet\n\nnumbers for the relevant year to track progress to target. We set out the annual figures before the application of the three-year average in the facilitated emissions table on page 61.\n\nWe have also set out our defined targets for the on-balance sheet financed emissions of the following sectors: cement; iron, steel and aluminium; aviation; automotive; and thermal coal mining. We disclose emissions in 2021 and 2022 and progress achieved in 2022 versus baseline for each sector.\n\nWe have implemented a revised approach to calculate the sector-level intensity metric in 2023, which has been applied for the recalculated power and utilities baseline metric, and for 2021 and 2022 actual data for all intensity-based sectors. Emissions intensity is a weighted average according to the portfolio weight of each investment, as a proportion of the total portfolio value.\n\nThe progress figures show the trend in financed

2022, and for the other sectors in February 2023. On the following pages, we provide more granular details of our financed emissions within these sectors.\n\nWhen assessing the changes from 2019 to 2022, it is important to emphasise the longterm commitment that is needed to meet our 2030 interim targets, and how changes to exposure and market fluctuations impact yearly updates. Movement from one year to the next may not reflect future trends for the financed emissions of our portfolio. In the hard-to-abate sectors, where decarbonisation progress is expected to be slower, we are taking steps to engage with clients on their transition plans.\n\nAs we are at the beginning of our journey to track and measure progress, we believe it would be premature to infer future trends from the 2019 to 2022 progress at this stage.",

        "page_content": "## Financed emissions continued\n\nWe plan to report financed emissions and progress against our targets annually and to be transparent in our disclosures about the methodologies applied and any challenges or dependencies. However, financed emissions figures may not be reconcilable or comparable year on year in future, and baselines and targets may require recalibration as data, methodologies and reference scenarios develop.\n\nConsistent with PCAF guidance on financed emissions accounting, we only consider the outstanding drawn financing amount\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nFor the oil and gas sector, our analysis included scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, for upstream and integrated companies. We revised our baseline for 2019 and progress figures to reflect combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions and our revised approach.\n\nWe have set a target to reduce absolute on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions for our oil and gas portfolio by 34% by 2030 relative to a 2019 baseline. This is consistent with a global 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway as defined by the IEA NZE 2021 scenario. This target is unchanged with the inclusion of facilitated emissions. We plan to update our target following the periodic release of new 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenarios in the years ahead to reflect shifts in the real economy.\n\n## Power and utilities\n\nFor the power and utilities sector, our analysis included scope 1 and 2 emissions for upstream power generation companies. Although scope 1 emissions are most material for the sector, most companies report scope 1 and 2 emissions together making it challenging to split out the data. We revised our baseline for 2019 and progress figures to reflect combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions and our revised approach.\n\nWe have set a target to reduce the financed emissions intensity of our on-balance sheet and facilitated power and utilities portfolio to 138 tCO 2 e/GWh by 2030. This target is unchanged with the inclusion of facilitated emissions. We have chosen an intensitybased target as electricity demand is expected to more than double by 2050 due to both population growth and electrification required to decarbonise mobility, buildings, and industry. We have focused on power generation companies because they control sector output. By engaging with them, we believe we can help drive the most material emissions impact in the real economy.\n\ngiven this has a direct link to real economy emissions.\n\nA number of clients have material undrawn balances that, if drawn, could significantly increase the financed emissions related to those clients. We expect to assess how to manage these exposures on a forward-looking basis as we progress towards our 2030 targets. In addition, for the intensity-based sectors, the emissions intensity is sensitive to material clients and changes to drawn balances year on year can therefore influence the trend.\n\nOur core approach as we progress towards our portfolio decarbonisation targets is to engage with major oil and gas customers to understand their transition plans and to help support and accelerate those e/fforts. This is in line with the Group's energy policy, which supports the phasing down of fossil fuel sources with the highest emission intensity as well as financing restrictions for projects relating to new oil and gas fields, and infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, absolute combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions decreased by 25% to 31.9 Mt CO 2 e relative to the 2019 baseline, and by 16% from 2021 to 2022. This decline was achieved through a risk-weighted assets reduction strategy and aided by market conditions, with stronger oil and gas cash flows and higher interest rates resulting in reduced demand for bank debt and capital markets financing. Market dynamics will continue to create volatility in future years as we make progress towards our financed emissions target.\n\nOur target is consistent with a global 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, as defined by the IEA NZE 2021 scenario. We plan to refresh our target following the periodic release of new 1.5\u00b0C-aligned scenarios in the years ahead.\n\nIn 2022, our combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions intensity decreased by 23% to 396.8 tCO 2 e/GWh relative to the 2019 baseline. This reduction was driven by an increase in financing of renewable energy projects and companies, and a decrease in financing of high emissions intensity clients. Over the period from 2022 to 2021 the fall in sector portfolio financed emissions was a more modest 2%.\n\nOver the reported period, the average emissions intensity of clients for whom we helped raise funds in the capital markets was lower than for clients financed directly on our balance sheet. This means the combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions intensity from 2019 to 2022 was lower than for on-balance sheet financing alone.\n\nWe are developing portfolio modelling capabilities that integrate risk, profitability and financed emissions to inform decision making and determine how to best steer our portfolios to meet our financed emissions targets and commercial and strategic ambitions. As part of this we are testing and developing an analytics capability that will provide an up-to-date view of our position relative to our 2030 targets and an indication of the financed emissions impact of a transaction to consider alongside risk-return metrics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHSBC sector target\n\nHSBC sector portfolio emissions\n\nMission Possible Partnership ('MPP') pathway",

        "page_content": "## Financed emissions continued\n\n## Cement\n\nFor the cement sector, our analysis included scope 1 and 2 emissions for midstream companies with clinker and cement manufacturing facilities.\n\nIn line with the IEA NZE 2021 scenario, we target an on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity of 0.46 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of cement ('tCO 2 e/t cement') by 2030, using 2019 as our baseline. While some emissions reductions can be achieved through energy e/fficiency, we believe that to significantly reduce fuel and process emissions from cement manufacturing, and to meet our targets, large-scale investments are required in new technologies, including clinker substitution, alternative fuel use such as bioenergy, and carbon capture use and storage.\n\n## Iron, steel and aluminium\n\nWe covered scope 1 and 2 for midstream iron, steel and aluminium production in our analysis. Due to the low significance of the aluminium sector's financed emissions within our portfolio, we combined them with our iron and steel financed emissions. In the event that aluminium becomes a more material part of our portfolio in the future, we may consider creating a separate target for aluminium production given the varied decarbonisation pathway for this metal.\n\nFor the iron, steel and aluminium sector, we target an on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity of 1.05 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of metal ('tCO 2 e/t metal') by 2030, using the IEA NZE 2021 scenario as our core scenario and 2019 as our baseline.\n\n## Aviation\n\nIn the aviation sector, we included passenger airlines' scope 1 and aircraft lessors' scope 3 downstream emissions. We excluded military and dedicated cargo flights as the emissions intensity of such cargo flights is di/fferent to that of passenger airlines. This approach is in line with industry practice to ensure consistency of financed emissions measurement and target setting.\n\nAligned with the IEA NZE 2021 scenario, we target an on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity of 63.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million revenue passenger kilometres ('tCO 2 e/million rpk') by 2030, using 2019 as our baseline. To reach these intensity levels and help meet our targets, we believe the sector needs significant policy support, investments in alternative fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, and new aircraft to reduce emissions.\n\nOur 2022 emissions intensity was 10% higher than the 2019 baseline due to higher drawn balances for emissions intensive clients, but at 0.71 tCO 2 e/t cement in 2022, it was marginally up by 1% from 2021.\n\nOur cement portfolio is relatively concentrated in customer numbers, and even where customers have set science-based targets there is still a risk of pledges not turning into the necessary emissions reductions if technologies do not scale in time. It will be important, therefore, to regularly review progress on technology scaling across the industry over the years ahead to 2030. For cement and the other intensity-based sectors we plan to integrate net zero considerations into our transaction processes and controls and we expect this to help guide our activities towards progressive alignment of the portfolio with our 2030 targets.\n\nDue to the challenges of decarbonising this hard-to-abate sector, we also outline an alternative scenario from the Mission Possible Partnership ('MPP').\n\nThe emissions intensity in 2022 rose by 38% to 2.5 tCO 2 e/t metal against our 2019 baseline and by 4% versus 2021. This was due to increased financing to the aluminium sector, which has a higher carbon intensity than that of steel.\n\nWe aim to actively manage our portfolio to achieve our 2030 financed emissions target for our iron, steel and aluminium portfolio, taking into account the actions our customers are taking to achieve emissions reductions.\n\nThe industry is also adopting the unit of revenue tonne kilometre ('rtk') to take into account the transport of cargo for airlines in scope of the target. We will consider this as part of our methodology enhancement.\n\nAt 86.5 tCO 2 e/million rpk in 2022, the emissions intensity increased by 3% versus the 2019 baseline and was marginally up by 1% from 2021. In 2020 there was a peak in emissions intensity due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as planes carried fewer passengers.\n\nWe plan to engage with our major customers on their transition plans, as well as integrate financed emissions implications into transaction and portfolio management for the sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key:\n\nHSBC sector target\n\nHSBC sector portfolio emissions\n\nMission Possible Partnership ('MPP') pathway",

We excluded heavy-duty vehicles from our analysis as the target pathway derived from the IEA excludes them, as they have a di/fferent decarbonisation pathway relative to light-duty vehicles. This approach is in line with industry practice to ensure consistency of financed emissions measurement and target setting. We will consider including heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers as well as heavy-duty vehicle production at a later stage of our analysis, as data and methodologies develop.\n\nWe target an on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity of 66.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million vehicle kilometres ('tCO 2 e/million vkm') by 2030 using 2019 as our baseline. This is in line with the IEA NZE 2021 scenario, which is a 1.5C\u00b0\n\n## Thermal coal mining\n\nFor the thermal coal mining sector, our analysis focused on scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in upstream companies, including those involved in extraction. The majority of our financed emissions relate to scope 3 emissions associated with coal mining.\n\nWe set an absolute on-balance sheet reduction target of 70% for 2030, from an absolute 2020 baseline measure of 4.0 Mt CO 2 e. We used 2020 as a baseline to align with the baseline used for our drawn balance exposure targets in the thermal coal phaseout policy. The financed emissions target is aligned with the IEA NZE 2021 scenario.\n\naligned pathway, modified to match the share of new in-year vehicle sales for light-duty vehicles. Decarbonisation of the automotive sector, and therefore our ability to meet our targets, needs large-scale investments in new electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plants, widespread charging infrastructure, and government policies to support electric vehicles.\n\nOur 2022 emissions intensity rose by 13% to 216.6 tCO 2 e/million vkm against our 2019 baseline and stayed level with 2021. This increase, after an 8% reduction in 2020 versus 2019, was caused by a shift in the portfolio towards companies producing more emissions-intensive vehicles. This can be the case for manufacturers that produce more sports utility vehicles or fewer electric vehicles.\n\nWhen calculating our financed emissions from thermal coal mining, we focused on thermal coal extraction and processing companies, and diversified mining companies. We aim to measure and focus on our customers with the most material thermal coal-related emissions in order to help drive a meaningful impact in the real economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey:\n\nHSBC sector target\n\nHSBC sector portfolio emissions\n\nMission Possible Partnership ('MPP') pathway",

For thermal coal mining, disclosures commenced in 2020 to align with thermal coal exposure reporting metrics. The PCAF data quality score has not improved for 2022 due to limited availability of actual reported emissions from our customers.\n\n1,2\n\n|                           | On-balance sheet financed

These assessments help us to identify opportunities, manage climate risks and define areas to drive strategic engagement with each corporate customer.\n\nOnce completed, these assessments can be used to support business decisions in relation to our financed emissions portfolio management and alignment, and our climate risk management e/fforts.\n\nOur processes and controls will continue to evolve as we look at net zero considerations for sectors, customers and deals with higher climate impact and risk. These considerations include: adherence with our sustainability risk policies; climate-related credit risk; customer transition plan assessment outcomes (where relevant); reputational risk considerations; and financed and, where applicable, facilitated emissions implications (where transactions are in scope of our financed emissions disclosures and 2030 targets). We have dedicated governance, with escalation pathways for deals deemed high risk, including in terms of financed emissions implications and reputation risk.\n\nIn 2023, we completed assessments for most customers in scope of our thermal coal phaseout policy. We also completed assessments for customers that make the most material contribution to our financed emissions in the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors.\n\n## Reducing emissions in our assets under management\n\nIn July 2021, our asset management business, HSBC Asset Management, signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which encourages investment firms to commit to managing assets in line with achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. HSBC Asset Management continues to work towards its ambition of reducing scope 1 and 2 financed emissions intensity by 58% by 2030 for 38% of its total assets under management. These listed equity and corporate fixed income assets\n\namounted to $193.9bn at 31 December 2019. We use 2019 as the baseline year for our calculations. Implementation of the net zero targets remains subject to consultation with stakeholders including investors, fund boards and regulators.\n\nIn 2023, HSBC Asset Management worked to develop solutions for clients to address climate ambitions while investing. Further data science expertise will be added to support sustainability through\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reducing landfill waste and emissions in the Philippines\n\nWe are supporting a company that is seeking to tackle the problem of overflowing landfills, which will help reduce methane emissions and create potential new jobs in the Philippines.\n\nIn June 2023, we provided a subsidiary of Prime Infrastructure Capital, a sustainable infrastructure firm with services that span energy, water distribution and waste management, with a $24.5m green loan. The loan was provided to finance its acquisition and expansion of a waste management facility in Cebu, Philippines.\n\nThe company has increased the facility's capacity to treat and recycle domestic and industrial solid waste, and is developing its capabilities to convert organic and agricultural feedstock waste into sustainable, refuse-derived fuel.\n\nThe funding is expected to help to divert waste away from landfill, which will reduce methane emissions generated by decomposing organic waste.\n\nthe creation of a Sustainable Investment Solutions Lab. HSBC Asset Management reported an update through the Principles for Responsible Investment annual submission, as required under its Net Zero Asset Managers commitment. As part of its thermal coal policy, it fulfilled a commitment to initiate engagement with all listed issuers held in active fundamental portfolios with more than 10% revenue exposure to thermal coal.",

        "page_content": "## Embedding net zero into the way we operate\n\n## Net zero in our own operations\n\nPart of our ambition to be a net zero bank is to achieve net zero carbon emissions in our operations and supply chain by 2030.\n\n## Reduce, replace and remove\n\nWe have three elements to our strategy: reduce, replace and remove. We plan to first focus on reducing carbon emissions from consumption, and then replacing remaining emissions with low-carbon alternatives in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe plan to remove the remaining emissions that cannot be reduced or replaced by procuring, in accordance with prevailing regulatory requirements, high-quality o/ffsets at a later stage. We are working on our carbon credits strategy by engaging with a range of market participants.\n\n## Our energy consumption\n\nIn October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a 2019 baseline, and in 2023 we achieved 26.3%. We continue to work to do this by optimising the use of our real estate portfolio, and carrying out a strategic reduction in our o/ffice space and data centres. We are using new technology and emerging products to make our spaces more energy e/fficient.\n\nAs part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green electricity in each of our markets. In 2023, our fourth UK renewable power purchase agreement ('PPA') went live in Sorbie, Scotland. A key challenge remains the limited opportunity to pursue PPAs or green tari/ffs in key markets due to regulations.\n\n## Business travel\n\nOur ambition is to halve travel emissions by 2030, compared with pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, our travel emissions remained below 50% of our 2019 baseline, despite the lifting of international travel restrictions. We are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclosely managing the gradual resumption of travel through internal reporting and review of emissions, internal carbon budgets and the introduction of emissions information at the point of booking. With hybrid working embedded across the organisation, the use of virtual working practices has reduced the need for our colleagues to travel to meet with other colleagues and customers.\n\nWe continue to focus on reducing the environmental impact from the vehicles we use in our global markets, and accelerate the use of electric vehicles. In 2023, we reduced the company car fleet size by 9% compared with 2022. We are now aiming to ensure that all new vehicles ordered are fully electric or hybrid vehicles where possible.\n\n## Engaging with our supply chain\n\nOur supply chain is critical to achieving our net zero ambitions, and we are partnering with our suppliers on this journey. Since 2020, we have been encouraging our largest suppliers to make their own carbon commitments, and to disclose their emissions via the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) supply chain programme. In 2023, suppliers representing 70.6% of total supplier spend completed the CDP questionnaire, compared with 63.5% in 2022.\n\nWe will continue to engage with our supply chain through CDP, and through direct discussions with our suppliers on how they can further support our transition to net zero.\n\nIn 2023, we launched our supplier net zero guides, providing further details to support suppliers in understanding our net zero ambitions, as set out in our supplier code of conduct. We are developing internal decarbonisation plans for the highest-emitting procurement categories (IT hardware, real estate, data centre and servers, and telecom services), to be included in category strategies and to support future supplier selection.\n\n## Focus on natural resources\n\nAlongside our net zero operations ambition, our aim is to be a responsible consumer of natural resources. Through design, construction and operational standards, we strive to ensure that, wherever possible, our premises do not adversely a/ffect the environment or natural resources. We have identified specific focus areas including waste, paper and sustainable diets, and are exploring key opportunities to reduce our wider environmental impact over the coming decade.\n\n## Our presence in environmentally sensitive areas\n\nAs a global organisation, our branches, o/ffices and data centres may be located in areas of high or very high water stress and/ or protected areas of biodiversity, as we support our customers and communities in these locations.\n\nApproximately 55% of our global o/ffices, branches and data centres are located in areas identified as being subject to high and very high water stress, accounting for 50% of our annual water consumption. These are predominantly urban or city centre locations with large, concentrated populations. Our industry is a low user of potable water, and we have implemented measures to further reduce water consumption through the installation of flow restrictors, auto-taps and low or zero flush sanitary fittings.\n\nIn addition, 0.9% of our global o/ffice, branch and data centre portfolio lies in protected areas of biodiversity. We strive through our design, construction and operational standards to ensure that, where possible, our premises do not adversely a/ffect the environment or natural resources in these areas.\n\n## Our environmental and sustainability management policies\n\nOur buildings policy recognises that regulatory and environmental requirements vary across geographies and may include environmental certification. The policy is supported by Corporate Services procedures on environmental and sustainability management, seeking to ensure that HSBC's properties continually reduce their overall direct impact on the environment. Detailed design considerations documented in our Global Engineering Standards aim to reduce or avoid depletion of critical resources, such as energy, water, land and raw materials.

We report greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the energy used in our buildings and employees' business travel. Due to the nature of our primary business, carbon dioxide is the main type of greenhouse gas applicable to our operations. While the amount is immaterial, our current reporting also incorporates methane and nitrous oxide for completeness. Our environmental data for our own operations is based on a 12-month period to 30 September.\n\nIn 2023, we reduced emissions from our energy consumption and travel to 293,333 tonnes CO 2 e, which represents a 57.3% reduction compared with our 2019 baseline. This was mainly attributed to:\n\n- - travel volumes remaining low compared with pre-pandemic levels;\n- - an increase in our consumption of renewable electricity to 58.4%; and\n- - the reduction of energy consumption as a result of strategic footprint reductions and the implementation of over 450 energy conservation measures, which amounted to an estimated energy avoidance in excess of 12 million kWh.\n\nEmissions from business travel increased compared with 2022, due to the easing of pandemic-related travel restrictions which resulted in a return to travel. A decrease in scope 1 emissions was partly attributed to a correction in the classification of road-based business travel in the UK and India from scope 1 to scope 3.\n\nIn 2023, we collected data on energy use and business travel for our operations in 34 countries and territories, which accounted for approximately 96.0% of our full-time employees ('FTEs'). To estimate the emissions of our operations in entities where we have operational control and a small presence, we scale up the emissions data from 96.0% to 100%. We then apply emission uplift rates to reflect uncertainty concerning the quality and coverage of emission measurement and estimation. This is consistent with both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and our internal analysis of data coverage and quality.\n\n## Emissions from our supply chain\n\nOur calculation methodology uses supplier emissions data where we have it from suppliers, through CDP. Where we do not have actual emissions data, we use industry\n\n|                                              | 2023    |           | 2022      | 19,329   |         |         |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Scope 2 (market-based) 1                     | 167,174 |           |           |          | 223,334 | 392,270 |\n| Category 1: Purchased goods and services 1,2 | 859,256 |           | 865,747   |          |         |         |\n| Category 2: Capital goods 1,2                |         | 121,783   | 144,232   | 37,617   | 37,617  | 37,617  |\n| Category 6: Business travel 1                |         | 109,241   |           | 42,285   | 42,285  | 42,285  |\n| Total                                        |         | 1,274,372 | 1,294,927 |          |         |         |\n| Included energy UK                           |         | 5,909     | 9,264     |          |         |         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Our data is now presented on an absolute value basis and not rounded values.

We manage climate risk across all our businesses and are incorporating climate considerations within our traditional risk types in line with our Group-wide risk management framework.\n\nOur material exposure to climate risk relates to wholesale and retail client financing activity within our banking portfolio. We are also exposed to climate risk in relation to asset ownership by our insurance business and employee pension plans. Our clients are exposed to climate-related investment risk in our asset management business.\n\nEmployees\n\nEmployees\n\nIn the table below, we set out our duties to our stakeholders in our four most material roles.\n\n- For further details of our approach to climate risk, see 'ESG risk' on page 141 and 'Climate risk' on page 221.\n\nRegulators and\n\nRegulators and\n\nCommunities\n\ngovernments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Banking\n\nOur banking business is well positioned to support our customers managing their own climate risk through financing. For our wholesale customers, we use our transition engagement questionnaire to understand clients' climate strategies and risks. We have set out a suite of policies to guide our management of climate risk. We continue to develop our climate risk appetite and metrics to help manage climate exposures in our wholesale and retail portfolios. We also develop and use climate scenario analysis to gain insights on the long-term e/ffects of transition and physical risks across our wholesale and retail banking portfolios (for further details, see page 225).\n\n## Asset management\n\nHSBC Asset Management recognises that climate risk may manifest as transition and physical risks over the short, medium and long term. The impact of climate-related risk will vary depending on characteristics such as asset class, sector, business model and geography. Where applicable and relevant, HSBC Asset Management incorporates climate-related indicators, such as carbon intensity and management of carbon emissions, into investment decisions as well as insights from its climate-related engagement.\n\nWork continues on the integration of ESG and climate analysis into HSBC Asset Management's actively managed product o/fferings to help ensure the climate risks\n\nfaced by companies are considered when making investment decisions and to assess ESG risks and opportunities that could impact investment performance.\n\nHSBC Asset Management engages with investee companies on a priority list as defined in its Global Stewardship Plan, and votes at company general meetings, including on the topic of climate change. It also works with collaborative engagement initiatives such as Climate Action 100+ and Nature Action 100.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of the HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited's annual TCFD Report, see https://www.assetmanagement. hsbc.co.uk/-/media/files/attachments/uk/ common/tcfd-report-2022.pdf.\n\n## Employee pensions\n\nThe Trustee of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme, our largest plan with $36bn assets under management, aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its defined benefit and defined contribution assets by 2050. To help achieve this, it is targeting an interim emissions reduction of 50% by 2030, from 2019 levels, for its equity and corporate bond mandates. This commitment was made in the context of wider e/fforts to manage the impact of climate change on the Scheme's investments and the consequent impact on the financial interests of members.\n\nThe Scheme, which has reported emission reductions for its listed equity and corporate bond mandate portfolios between 2019\n\ngovernments\n\nand 2022 through its annual TCFD Report, will continue to report against the 2030 targets and aims to widen the coverage of its assessment and reporting over time. In 2023, its asset managers were formally notified of the Trustee's ESG risk mitigation priorities and encouraged to develop commensurate risk mitigation strategies. The manager monitoring and selection processes now explicitly include assessment of these strategies where financially material.\n\n- For further details of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme's annual TCFD statements and climate action plan, see http://futurefocus.sta/ff. hsbc.co.uk/active-dc/information-centre/ other-information.\n\n## Insurance\n\nIn 2023, our Insurance business updated its sustainability procedures to align with the Group's updated energy and thermal coalphase out policies. We also delivered ESG product marketing guidelines with insurance examples and training.\n\nIn response to various ESG regulatory initiatives and developments, HSBC's insurance manufacturing entities in the EU, which are in Malta and France, have continued to implement key disclosure-related regulatory requirements, including pre-contractual reporting, client periodic reporting and sustainable investment impact statements. Related requirements for the UK are expected to be introduced in 2024.",

Our policies are important mechanisms for delivering our net zero ambitions, as well as for managing sustainability risks.\n\nWe regularly review our policies, incorporating feedback and building on experience from policy implementation over time.\n\n## Our policies\n\nOur sustainability risk policies comprise our core net zero-aligned policies - thermal coal phase-out and energy - and our broader sustainability risk policies covering: agricultural commodities, chemicals, forestry, mining and metals, and World Heritage Sites and Ramsar-designated wetlands. We also apply the Equator Principles when financing relevant projects.\n\nOur sustainability risk policies focus on mitigating the negative impacts of specific sectors on people and the environment. Our net zero policies, including energy and thermal coal phase-out, also support our ambition to transition to net zero. Engaging with customers on their transition plans is a key aspect of our net zero policy approach. These policies aim to provide clear signals to our customers on how our appetite and expectations for di/fferent activities are changing, as well as how we will consider their plans for the future.\n\nWe continue to review policy implementation as we apply our policies in practice, and our operationalisation of such policies continues to be enhanced. We take a risk-based approach when identifying transactions and clients to which our energy and thermal coal phase-out policies apply, and when reporting on relevant exposures, adopting approaches proportionate to risk and materiality. This helps to focus our e/fforts on areas where we believe we can help drive meaningful change, while taking into account experience from policy implementation over time.\n\nWhere we identify activities that could cause material negative impacts, we expect customers to demonstrate that they are identifying and mitigating risks responsibly, and we will look to take required actions as outlined in our policies, which may include applying financing restrictions or enhanced due diligence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of how we manage sustainability risk, as well as our full policies, see www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-andresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\n\n## Governance and implementation\n\nOur Group Risk and Compliance function has specialists who review and support implementation of our sustainability risk policies. Our relationship managers are the primary point of contact for many of our business customers and are responsible for managing customers' adherence to the sustainability risk policies. They are supported by sustainability risk managers across the Group who have local or regional responsibility for advising on, and overseeing, the management of risks as outlined in the policies. Where considered appropriate, policy matters are escalated to relevant internal governance committees.\n\nOversight of the development and implementation of policies is the responsibility of relevant governance committees comprising senior members of the Group Risk and Compliance function and global businesses.\n\n## Biodiversity and natural capital-related policies\n\nOur sustainability risk policies impose restrictions on certain financing activities that may have material negative impacts on nature. While a number of our sustainability risk policies have such restrictions, our forestry and agricultural commodities policies focus specifically on a key nature-related impact: deforestation. These policies require customers involved with major deforestationrisk commodities to operate in accordance with sustainable business principles. We also require palm oil customers to obtain certification under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, and commit to 'No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation' (see 'Our respect for human rights' on page 89).\n\n## Our energy policy\n\nOur energy policy covers the broader energy system, including upstream oil and gas, fossil fuel power generation, hydrogen, renewables and hydropower, nuclear, biomass and wasteto-energy sectors.\n\nThe policy seeks to balance three objectives: driving down global greenhouse gas emissions; enabling an orderly transition that builds resilience in the long term; and supporting a just and a/ffordable transition, recognising the local realities in all the communities we serve.\n\nThe energy policy was first published in December 2022 and updated in January 2024. We review the policy annually to help ensure that it remains aligned with our net zero by 2050 ambition and strategic objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our oil and gas, and power and utilities financed emissions targets, see the 'Targets and progress' section in 'Financed emissions on page 57.\n- For further details of our energy policy, see www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-andresponsibility/sustainability-risk.",

In turn our policy supports progress towards our financed emissions targets for the power and utilities and thermal coal mining sectors.\n\nThe policy was first published in December 2021 and is reviewed annually, with the most recent update in January 2024, to help ensure that it remains aligned with our commitments and takes into consideration relevant changes in external factors.\n\n- For our thermal coal phase-out policy, see www. hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/our-approach/risk-andresponsibility/pdfs/240125-hsbc-thermal-coalphase-out-policy.pdf.\n- For further details of our thermal coal phase-out policy January 2024 update, see page 71 of our Net Zero Transition Plan 2024, which is available at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-climatestrategy/our-net-zero-transition-plan.\n\n## Thermal coal financing exposures\n\nWe intend to reduce thermal coal financing drawn balance exposure from a 2020 baseline by at least 25% by 2025 and aim to reduce it by 50% by 2030.\n\n## Asset Management policy\n\nHSBC Asset Management published its own policy on thermal coal in September 2022, and its own energy policy in November 2023. As an asset manager, it is subject to separate regulatory and legal obligations to deliver customers' investment interests and deliver fair outcomes.\n\nUnder its thermal coal policy, HSBC Asset Management will not hold listed securities of issuers with more than de minimis revenue exposure to thermal coal in its actively managed funds beyond 2030 for EU and OECD markets, and globally by 2040. The policy also includes enhanced due diligence on the transition plans of investee companies with thermal coal exposure. Companies held in investment portfolios that do not develop credible plans to\n\nIn our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 we acknowledged that our processes, systems, controls and governance were not yet designed to fully identify and disclose thermal coal exposures and that we planned to reassess the reliability of our data and review our basis of preparation to help ensure that we are reporting all relevant thermal coal exposures aligned to our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\nWe have now revised the basis of preparation for our thermal coal exposures. Aligned with our thermal coal phase-out policy, we applied a risk-based approach to identify clients and report on relevant exposures. This includes the use of globally recognised third-party data sources to screen clients and applies materiality considerations to product type, customer type and exposure type, which informs inclusion and exclusion requirements.\n\nSpecifically, for product types, short-term lending exposures are excluded from our thermal coal financing exposures reporting in line with our financed emissions methodology. For customer types, exclusions are applied for certain customer types such as sovereigns and individuals. For exposure types, a threshold of $15m for drawn balances is applied for thermal coal financing exposures reporting. For the avoidance of doubt, the $15m threshold applies only to exposure reporting analysis and does not apply to the application of the thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\n- For further details of our Financed Emissions and Thermal Coal Exposures Methodology, see www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/esg-reporting-centre.\n\ntransition away from thermal coal could face voting sanctions and ultimately a divestment of holdings.\n\nUnder its energy policy, HSBC Asset Management will engage with - and assess the transition plans of - oil and gas, and power and utilities companies held in its portfolios. For its active fundamental sustainable named funds, it will exclude listed issuers whose overall operations are substantially in unconventional oil and gas, subject to data availability, and with the level and scope of exclusions to be set out in fund prospectuses. In its alternatives business, it will not undertake new direct investments in projects associated with the energyrelated activities identified as excluded from new finance or advisory services\n\nConsidering materiality criteria helps us to focus our e/fforts on areas where we believe we can help drive meaningful change, while taking into account experience from policy implementation over time.\n\nApplying our revised basis of preparation, our thermal coal financing drawn balance exposure was approximately $1bn \u2020 as at 31 December 2020. We continue to work on our 2021 and 2022 numbers based on our revised basis of preparation and expect to report on these in future disclosures.\n\n- For further details of our approach to financed emissions, see 'Our Approach to financed emissions' on page 53.\n- \u2020  Data is subject to independent limited assurance by PwC in accordance with ISAE 3000/ISAE 3410.

We seek to collaborate with a range of partners to develop a supportive environment for achieving net zero and mobilising finance for climate action and nature-based solutions. Our partnerships vary in scope and form depending on the sector and geography, as well as our presence in local markets. We act independently and voluntarily in our decision making, based on our own business interests, priorities and objectives, and in accordance with the laws and regulations of the markets in which we operate.\n\n## Working with the public sector\n\nWe engage with governments and public bodies to support the implementation of policies and regulations, including promoting good practice to develop globally consistent approaches to nature and climate-related financial regulation. In 2023, this included:\n\n- - working with the UK Net Zero Council, a cross-government business partnership, to help address market barriers to delivering net zero, including high start-up costs for renewable energy projects, regulatory challenges and uncertainty around policy frameworks; and\n- - continuing to engage with Just Energy Transition Partnerships contributing to Indonesia's comprehensive investment and policy plan and Vietnam's resource mobilisation plan, which provide roadmaps for minimising the negative impact on local communities of phasing out fossil fuels and how banks can support the transition.\n\n## Working with industry\n\nWe participate in cross-industry alliances and initiatives to stimulate industry engagement in nature and climate-related issues, and improve consistency in global financial standards, guidance and frameworks to accelerate implementation. In 2023, these included:\n\n- - We are supporting the widespread adoption of the GFANZ net zero transition plan framework, as a member of its Principals Group. We also jointly led a working group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto develop guidance for financial institutions on financing the managed phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia-Pacific.\n\n- - As Chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative's ('SMI') Financial Services Taskforce, we have been actively involved in the publication of industry guidance to help encourage investment in critical ecosystems and sustainable agricultural practices. These include sponsorship of a report by Pollination on financing coastal naturebased solutions, as well as contributing to the Mangrove Breakthrough initiative's financial roadmap and the SMI Agribusiness Task Force's blended finance framework for regenerative farming.\n- - As a member of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures ('TNFD'), we have piloted the TNFD beta framework to better understand our exposure to nature-related risks, including on subsets of customers. We are currently focused on assessing and preparing for mandatory nature-related disclosure requirements, and we continue to engage with TNFD and explore ways it can help us and our clients to strengthen nature-related reporting.\n\nIn 2023, we also supported financial product development to help mobilise the allocation of capital towards halting and reversing nature loss:\n\n- - We worked with the ICMA to help develop global guidance for issuers launching blue bonds - debt instruments that raise capital to finance sustainable marine and ocean-based projects - including eligibility criteria, standards for evaluating the impact of projects, and the steps needed to build the integrity of the blue economy and mobilise investment.\n\n## Working with civil society and non-governmental organisations\n\nAs part of our global philanthropy, we have partnered with a range of organisations to support the acceleration of climate action and investments in nature.\n\nOur five-year Climate Solutions Partnership initiative with the World Resources Institute, WWF and over 50 local partners, continues to support the scaling up of nature-based solutions and the transition of the energy sector in Asia. This includes engaging with local enterprises across Asia to make climate commitments and take corporate action. Under the Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme, we are working closely with smallholders and traders to transition to more sustainable practices and reduce nature-related losses.\n\nWe have also established several new partnerships focused on transitioning industry, decarbonising global trade and catalysing the new economy. These include:\n\n- - a three-year partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute to mobilise blended finance for projects to reduce supply chain emissions in the global fashion industry;\n- - a founding membership of the Capacitybuilding Alliance for Sustainable Investment, a global platform providing local capacity building services and technical assistance to support growth of transition financing in emerging markets and developing economies; and\n- - a two-year partnership with Repower, a global non-profit initiative analysing the technical and commercial feasibility of various options for repowering and repurposing coal-fired power plants to accelerate the transition to clean energy.\n- - We partnered with Earth Security to explore the barriers, opportunities and design options for creating a 'mangrove bond' in Queensland, Australia to help generate funding to enhance mangrove ecosystems. This led to the publication of a practical blueprint for investors, banks, corporates and governments to develop new sustainable fixed income and investment product opportunities.\n\n## Unlocking the potential of Chinese ecosystems\n\nWe have been working with the SEE Foundation in China on a multi-stakeholder pilot project to enhance the climate resilience and biodiversity of forests, inland wetlands, and mangroves in several selected local provinces. The project aims to restore and promote sustainable management of key ecosystems and improve ecosystem services such as carbon sinks, as a model for other areas in China and around the world. Its e/fforts to reduce emissions, and generate jobs through the support of sustainable local enterprises, has also unlocked government and public funding for expansion and gained recognition from the World Bank and the Chinese government.",

In relation to financed emissions, we publish on-balance sheet  financed emissions for a number of sectors as detailed on page 18. We also publish facilitated emissions for  the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. Future disclosures on financed emissions and related risks are  reliant on our customers publicly disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, targets and plans, and related  risks. We recognise the need to provide early transparency on climate disclosures but balance this with the  recognition that existing data and reporting processes require significant enhancements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                             | -

It involves a commitment to identifying and addressing barriers that may stop people from accessing opportunities because of who they are or where they are from.\n\nInclusion goes hand in hand with resilience. We aim to help people build the capabilities they need to achieve their goals and to deal with the challenges they face, so we are focused on delivering products, services and education that support our colleagues, customers and communities.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nWe believe that an inclusive, healthy and rewarding workplace helps the whole Group succeed. We are focused on recruiting and retaining diverse talent by o/ffering fair pay and career progression so we can ensure our colleagues - and particularly our leadership - are representative of the communities we serve. We do this by setting meaningful goals and tracking and monitoring our progress. In 2023, we continued to make progress against all of our goals, although the progress we are\n\nmaking with women in senior leadership roles has not been as fast paced as we would like.\n\nEmployee well-being is essential. We o/ffer all colleagues a wide range of resources that help support their mental, physical and financial well-being so they can thrive in and out of work. We are working to ensure that our o/ffices, branches and digital spaces are accessible and safe for all.\n\nWe also help our colleagues build resilience by ensuring that they are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to progress their careers during a period of significant economic transformation.\n\n## Customers\n\nWe are committed to helping our customers access the financial services they need. They should not find it more di/fficult to access finance because of their gender, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their neurodiversity or their disability. Our ambition is to create a welcoming, inclusive and accessible banking experience for all our customers.\n\nWe build resilience by creating products and services that simplify the banking experience, so customers can manage and grow their wealth more easily. We also help protect what people value most - their health, families, homes and belongings. We also build resilience by providing education so customers can understand how to manage their finances more e/ffectively.\n\n## Communities\n\nWe are developing an updated global philanthropy strategy that allows us to work alongside the communities we operate within, and which aligns with our ESG areas of focus - 'transition to net zero' and 'building inclusion and resilience'.\n\nWe believe that fostering inclusion and building resilience helps us to create long-term value and growth. By removing unnecessary barriers and striving to be a fair and equitable organisation, we can attract and retain the best talent, support a wider customer base to achieve their goals and stimulate growth in our communities. This is how we open up a world of opportunity for our colleagues, our customers and our communities.\n\n## In this section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Promoting diversity  and fostering  inclusion   | Our approach to diversity  and inclusion           | We value diversity of thought and we are building an inclusive  environment that reflects our customers and communities.                                                              | Page  76   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Promoting diversity  and fostering  inclusion   | Creating a diverse  environment                    | We value diversity of thought and we are building an inclusive  environment that reflects our customers and communities.                                                              | Page  77   |\n| Promoting diversity  and fostering  inclusion   | Fostering an  inclusive culture                    | We value diversity of thought and we are building an inclusive  environment that reflects our customers and communities.                                                              | Page  78   |\n| Building a healthy  workplace                   | Listening to our colleagues                        | We run a Snapshot survey and report insights to our Group  Executive Committee and the Board.                                                                                         | Page  79   |\n| Building a healthy  workplace                   | Being a great place to work                        | We aim to create a great workplace that will help in attracting,  retaining and motivating our colleagues so they can deliver for our  customers across countries and territories.    | Page  81   |\n| Developing skills,  careers and  opportunities  | Learning and skills  development                   | We aim to build a dynamic, inclusive culture where colleagues can  develop skills and experiences that help them fulfil their potential.                                              | Page  83   |\n| Developing skills,  careers and  opportunities  | Energising our colleagues  for growth              | We are committed to o/ffering colleagues the chance to develop  their skills while building pipelines of talented colleagues to  support the achievement of our strategic priorities. | Page  84   |\n| Building customer  inclusion and  resilience    | Our approach to customer  inclusion and resilience | We aim to support financial well-being and remove barriers  people can face in accessing financial services.                                                                          | Page  85   |\n| Engaging with our  communities                  | Building a more   inclusive and resilient world    | We focus on a number of priorities where we can make a  di/fference to the community and support sustainable growth.                                                                  | Page  86   |",

        "page_content": "## Promoting diversity and fostering inclusion\n\n## Our approach to diversity and inclusion\n\nOur purpose, 'Opening up a world of opportunity', explains why we exist as an organisation, and is the foundation of our diversity and inclusion strategy. Inclusion is an enabler for our 'energise' strategic pillar, and is embedded in the values of our organisation. By valuing di/fference and seeking di/fferent\n\nperspectives, we can more accurately reflect the societies we serve, creating better outcomes for customers and colleagues.\n\nOur data-driven strategy enables us to set aspirational goals to track and monitor our progress. We remain focused on specific\n\n## How we hold ourselves to account\n\n## We set meaningful goals\n\nOur executive Directors and Group Executives are accountable for progressing our agenda through a series of diversity and inclusion aspirational goals that align to three public commitments that we have made. In 2023, we continued to make progress against our three goals by:\n\n- - achieving a 34.1% representation of women in senior leadership roles, with a goal of achieving 35% by 2025;\n- - attaining a 3.0% representation of Black heritage colleagues in senior leadership in the UK and US combined, against a goal to achieve 3.4% by 2025; and\n- - increasing our Inclusion index as measured in our Snapshot survey, to 78% against a 2023 target of 75%.\n\n## A data-driven approach to inclusion\n\nWe are evolving our data-driven approach by enabling more of our colleagues to self-identify across a range of data points. This data has enabled us to set locally relevant priorities and identify areas of our organisation where we need to focus our attention. We invite colleagues to self-identify on a broad range of data points where we can, although given the international nature of our business, there are some jurisdictions where we are unable to invite colleagues to share their diversity data with us. We have enabled 91% of our colleagues to disclose their ethnic background, with 62% of colleagues choosing to do so, where this is legally permissible.\n\nOur approach goes beyond ethnic heritage and considers broader representation within the workplace. We have enabled 90% of the workforce to share whether they have a disability, 71% of our workforce to share their sexual orientation, and all UK-based colleagues to share their socio-economic background.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach to Asian heritage representation\n\nOur roots as an organisation trace back over 150 years to Hong Kong, where HSBC opened its doors to serve clients with international needs. Asia remains a strategic focus for us today.\n\nTo better reflect the communities we serve, we have a focus on increasing representation across our global workforce, including Asian heritage representation. Defining Asian heritage can be complex due to the vast range of ethnicities and identities across the region. In 2023, 37.8% of our senior leaders were able to self-identify as being from an Asian heritage background. To deliver our international strategy it is vital that we are both representative of our local communities, and able to mobilise leaders with global perspective and diverse heritage backgrounds across our international network.\n\n## We report and track progress\n\nMeasuring our performance ensures we consistently and accurately monitor the progress made against our aspirational goals. Our databacked approach tracks this through:\n\n- - an inclusion dashboard, which monitors progress against goals with trend data on hiring, promotion and exit ratios, is reported to the Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis; and\n- - semi-annual review meetings where our Head of Inclusion meets each Group Executive to review data, their progress against their aspirational goals, and to support further progress.\n\nGroup-wide priorities for which we hold senior executives accountable. Some executives also have local priorities, which ensures our diversity and inclusion agenda remains locally relevant.\n\n## We benchmark our performance\n\nExternal disclosures and benchmarks allow us to measure the progress that we are making and identify opportunities for future prioritisation. In 2023, we:\n\n- - scored 87.2% in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index measuring our gender-related data, transparency and performance;\n- - maintained our Stonewall Gold standard and rank as a top global LGBTQ+ inclusion employer; and\n- - ranked as a Top 75 employer in the UK Social Mobility Index in our first year of entering a submission.",

We remain on track, with 34.1% of senior leadership roles held by women at the end of 2023, excluding our Canada business, which is planned for sale in 2024. Progress in the past year has not been as fast paced as we would like. A total of 37.7% of all external appointments into senior positions were female, compared with 35.7% in 2022, and women represented 39.6% of all promotions into senior leadership roles in 2023.\n\nDevelopment programmes, including our Accelerating Female Leaders initiative, have helped to increase the visibility, sponsorship and network of our high performing, senior women. Since the start of the programme in 2017, 24% of participants have been promoted and 2% have taken a lateral move to develop their careers. We have also retained over 79% of colleagues who completed the programme.\n\nIn our 2023 Accelerating into Leadership programme, which prepares high potential, mid-level colleagues for leadership roles, 43% of participants were women. More than 5,200 women also participated in our Coaching Circles programme, which matches senior leaders with a small group of colleagues to provide advice and support on the development of leadership skills and network building.\n\nOur succession planning for key leadership roles includes an assessment of the diversity of our succession plans. We are improving the gender diversity of those roles critical to our organisation and the successors to those roles. In 2023, 40% of the succession pool for these roles were women, compared with 36% in 2022.\n\n## Representation and pay gaps\n\nWe publish this data annually to ensure both transparency and a maintained focus on addressing representation gaps within the organisation. Our gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting shows the di/fference in average pay between two groups of people (regardless of roles or seniority). We have reported our UK gender representation and pay gap data since 2017 in line with reporting regulations, and have voluntarily extended this to include the US, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Singapore and the UAE, alongside ethnicity data for the UK and US. In 2023, we also included gender pay gap data for Argentina and Malaysia, covering\n\napproximately 80% of our workforce (excluding our Canada business held for sale. In 2023, our mean aggregate UK-wide gender pay gap was 43.2%, compared with 45.2% in 2022, and the ethnicity pay gap was 4.5%, compared with 0.4% in 2022. Our UK gender pay gap is driven by several factors including the shape of our workforce, where there are more men than women in senior higher-paid roles, and more women than men in junior roles.

The aim of the strategy is to ensure we accurately reflect the communities we serve and the societies in which we operate. We continue to identify challenges colleagues from diverse backgrounds face in achieving their aspirations at HSBC.\n\nWe have continued to focus on the development of Black heritage colleagues through the delivery of dedicated development programmes. Using data analytics, we have identified that in the UK, Black heritage female colleagues are less likely to hold positions as people managers. To address this, we introduced the Solaris programme to provide coaching and development for our UK-based Black heritage female colleagues. Forty women have successfully completed the programme and 29% have been promoted.\n\nWe also partnered with Vivida, a virtual reality firm, to launch an immersive learning programme designed to bring to life the experiences of Black heritage and ethnic minority colleagues, highlighting the pressures, barriers and biases faced by these communities. The programme has been completed by 11,900 colleagues, and was nominated for awards at the 2023 European Diversity Awards and as finalists at The 2024 Learning Awards.\n\nIn 2023 EmpowHER was launched, a programme created by Black heritage women for Black heritage women at midmanagement levels across the UK business.",

        "page_content": "## Fostering an inclusive culture\n\nOur inclusion strategy seeks to make HSBC an organisation in which every colleague can feel like they belong, and are empowered to contribute their perspectives and ideas. Our strategy sits above a range of diversity and inclusion strands from gender, ethnicity and faith to disability and socio-economic background - we want to ensure that all colleagues are able to realise their full potential.\n\nWe use the Inclusion index in our annual Snapshot survey to measure the extent to which our colleagues feel a sense of belonging and psychological safety within the organisation, alongside their perception of fairness and trust. In 2023, we achieved a score of 78%, which is three percentage points ahead of our annual aspirational goal, and two percentage points ahead of the financial services industry benchmark.\n\nAnalysis of our Inclusion index allows us to measure engagement levels of specific colleague groups in greater detail, in particular di/fferent diversity strands, to better understand the experiences of our colleagues globally. We found that scores from colleagues who identify as male and female were broadly in line with the overall Groupwide result, at 79% and 77% respectively. From an ethnicity perspective, our Black heritage colleagues were four percentage points below the Group-wide average, while our Asian heritage colleagues' results were on a par with the overall score, at 78%.\n\n## Our employee resource groups\n\nOur employee resource groups ('ERGs') foster an inclusive culture and contribute significantly to the experience of tens of thousands of colleagues. They operate globally and are led by colleagues with a range of shared values, identities, interests and goals, including disability, LGBTQ+, ethnicity, faith and gender.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach of our non-executive Directors and most Group Executives are aligned with one of our global ERGs, ensuring there is a direct link between senior leadership and our colleagues. The non-executive Director dedicated to workforce engagement is closely aligned to our diversity and inclusion strategy and has attended events such as our 2023 Global ERG Summit.\n\nIn 2023, our ERGs led numerous initiatives and events, including the Ability network hosting a global summit aimed at driving cultural change to build confidence for colleagues with a disability. Our Nurture ERG, which supports working parents and carers, launched the #LeaveLoudly Campaign globally. Its aim is to drive engagement by counteracting 'presenteeism', acknowledging that everyone has multifaceted lives, and to show that leaders across HSBC support a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## Looking to the future on disability\n\nEnhancing the experience of our employees, particularly those with disabilities, is a vital part of our commitment to build an inclusive organisation. A key initiative has been a targeted career development programme to empower colleagues with confidence to drive their careers forward.\n\nRecognising the pivotal role of line managers, we have introduced a learning plan through our Degreed platform to help managers support team members with physical, sensory, long-term, and mental health conditions, as well as those who identify as neurodiverse. Our Ability ERG has hosted support sessions globally, where colleagues shared their experiences and raised awareness for disability inclusion, and the support provided by HSBC.\n\nIn collaboration with PurpleSpace, the disability network and professional development hub, we sponsored and published a Leadership Model resource for employee groups. In 2023, we also sponsored\n\nthe UK Business Disability Forum's roundtable and conference. We have enhanced the support we provide to colleagues through our workplace adjustment programme partnering with Microlink, extending the availability of this service to almost 37,790 colleagues in our global service centres and technology centres in India.\n\n## UK socio-economic diversity\n\nWe believe that no-one should be limited by their socio-economic background and are committed to driving socio-economic inclusion within our workforce.\n\nIn 2022, we began exploring the impact socioeconomic background has on our colleagues, working with them, and internal and external stakeholders to develop our understanding on socio-economic diversity.\n\nIn 2023, we entered the Social Mobility Index for the first time and gained recognition as a top 75 employer. Our Strive ERG, sponsored by the Group Chief Human Resources O/fficer, now has over 1,000 members. We have continued to be an active member of Progress Together, focused on helping members progress and retain a socio-economically diverse workforce, including taking part in the largest financial services study of socioeconomic diversity.\n\nWe launched a career development programme through the Strive ERG, enabling colleagues from di/fferent backgrounds to lead with impact and build career confidence.\n\nWe continue to improve the socio-economic diversity data we collect by running campaigns encouraging our colleagues and job applicants to share their socio-economic background. In 2023, we extended our socio-economic focus to Asia, with an initial data collection pilot in Singapore through our employee engagement survey. We also launched a new learning plan, available for all employees to better understand what socioeconomic diversity is and why it matters.\n\n## Supporting colleagues experiencing menopause\n\nMany of our female colleagues will experience menopause symptoms during their career. We do not want menopause to be a silent struggle and we have put in place the right support so it does not need to be. In 2023, we launched a new global framework centred around three principles of: creating awareness; removing barriers; and being adaptable. These form the basis of our menopause toolkit, which is available to all colleagues, and includes guidance on how to access menopause support and guidance for line managers on how to best support those in need.\n\nWe recognise that there is much more we can do to support those who are experiencing menopause and those who are supporting others experiencing it. Senior sponsorship is helping to raise awareness and our first step is to provide access to dedicated resources on menopause.",

        "page_content": "## Building a healthy workplace\n\n## Listening to our colleagues\n\nListening to our colleagues is an essential part of building a healthy workplace at HSBC. We capture employee feedback in a variety of ways to understand how our colleagues feel about HSBC and to help us improve the employee experience.\n\n## How we listen\n\nOur annual Snapshot survey runs every September and gives all HSBC employees the opportunity to share their experiences of working at the organisation. Our 2023 survey achieved a record response rate of 85%, up from 78% in 2022, with nearly 180,000 colleagues choosing to share their views.\n\nThe results of Snapshot are discussed at all levels. Our record participation has enabled us to put more data directly in the hands of our people managers, with more than 11,000 teams able to access their results, while maintaining the confidentiality of individual employees' responses. Managers are supported by a guided action planning tool to help them understand and interpret insights relevant to their team, while directing them towards support resources for them and their teams to explore. Results are also shared with executive leadership teams across the Group, with detailed reporting provided to our Group People Committee and the Board.\n\nWe complement the Snapshot survey with our annual Performance and Reward survey, which runs every March. Open to all employees, it captures feedback on our annual performance and pay review cycle, providing valuable insight into how well we are meeting our colleagues' needs and expectations on compensation, development and professional growth.\n\nWe also run targeted listening activities for employees at key moments in their careers, capturing detailed feedback from new joiners, internal movers and voluntary leavers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee conduct and harassment\n\nWe expect all our employees to treat each other with respect and dignity, and we do not tolerate or condone harassment or bullying in any form. We continually strive to improve awareness and education around such behaviours, and strengthen our understanding and response to these issues across all levels of the organisation. In 2023, our overall Snapshot Speak up index improved slightly to 76%, up one percentage point from 2022.\n\nWe encourage our colleagues to speak up about poor behaviour or things that do not seem right, and we have included bullying, harassment, discrimination and retaliation in our 2023 Global Mandatory Training curriculum. Our Snapshot survey revealed an increase in colleagues able to state their opinion without fear of negative consequences, with 72% of colleagues feeling able to do so, up from 70% in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we launched our global code of conduct which is supported by our global antibullying and harassment code. This continues to help us to maintain high standards of conduct across the Group.\n\nWe have mandatory procedures, both globally and locally, for handling and investigating employee concerns, which include those for bullying and harassment. Cases are continually monitored from our speak-up channels, and data is reported to management committees to ensure there is visibility at leadership level.\n\nIn 2023, we had a total of 834 concerns raised relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination and retaliation. Where the concerns were substantiated following an investigation, appropriate action was taken, which included termination of services, where appropriate. In 2023, 38% of concerns raised were either partly or fully substantiated and 24 colleagues were dismissed in relation to bullying, harassment, discrimination or retaliation.\n\n## Promoting mental health awareness\n\nA poll posted by a senior leader on our intranet revealed that 94% of colleagues said they trust leadership more when they open up about their own mental health.\n\nTo build on this sentiment, we celebrated World Mental Health Day by running a global awareness campaign 'The Big Mental Health Conversation' in October 2023. We encouraged leaders to post questions on our intranet to gather feedback from colleagues on their experiences and how we can improve mental health support. We surveyed our colleagues during the campaign and half said they were very satisfied with the mental health support HSBC o/ffers. Supporting the mental health of our colleagues continues to be a priority, including ensuring that we continue to signpost how colleagues can access available support. Throughout 2023, we also held over 200 virtual events, featuring internal and external experts providing advice on mental health and topics related to well-being.\n\nWe are committed to addressing this type of behaviour and will continue to take action where we find that an employee has breached our values and high standards of conduct.\n\nEmployee engagement:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee engagement score (2022: 74%)\n\n## 81%\n\nOf colleagues who feel confident about this company's future (2022: 77%)\n\n## 85%\n\nOf colleagues who completed our annual Snapshot survey (2022: 78%)",

New questions were trialled in 2022 so comparisons are all reported on a like-for-like basis; as such, historical comparison figures di/ffer slightly from those reported last year.\n- 3  We benchmark Snapshot results against a peer group of global financial services institutions, provided by our research partner, Ipsos Karian and Box. Scores for each question are calculated as the percentage of employees who agree to each statement. For further details of the constituent questions and past results, see the ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n- 4 Previously: I feel valued at this company.\n- 5 Previously: My company is genuine in its commitment to encourage colleagues to speak up.\n- 6 Previously: Where I work, people can state their opinion without fear of negative consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of well-being, see page 82, and for further details of inclusion, see page 76.\n\n## What employees told us\n\nSeven of our eight Snapshot indices improved in 2023, while our change leadership index remained static. Our headline measure of employee engagement captures how employees feel about HSBC: whether they are proud to say they work here, whether they would recommend working at HSBC, and how motivated they feel to do their best work. Employee engagement increased by three percentage points compared with 2022, and seven percentage points above the external financial services benchmark. Our employee focus index, which measures how employees feel about their day-to-day work, increased by four percentage points to put HSBC four points ahead of the industry benchmark.\n\nAnalysis of the key drivers of our engagement scores showed that engaged colleagues are more likely to feel positive about their career, our strategy and our leadership. Our free text responses also showed that training and progression opportunities was the most cited reason for recommending HSBC, followed by our approach to flexible and hybrid working and the strength of our management.\n\nNegative comments continued to focus around pay and benefits but were mentioned less than in 2022. For further details of our approach to being a great place to work, including pay transparency, see page 81.\n\nOur Snapshot survey showed that 67% of employees plan to stay at HSBC for five or more years, a two percentage point increase since 2022. This aligned with a drop in voluntary turnover in 2023 to 9.3%, compared with 14.1% in 2022, and reflects trends in the wider employment market. Results from our listening channels continued to show that career opportunities and competitive reward packages remain the two key drivers behind our ability to attract and retain talented colleagues.\n\nWe are committed to building on our high levels of engagement and feedback throughout 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Being a great place to work\n\nTo deliver our purpose, ambition and strategy we need the best people, performing at their best. Creating a great workplace helps us attract, retain and motivate our colleagues so they can deliver for our customers.\n\nUnderpinning this is our reward strategy, which we updated in 2022 to create an environment where the best people want to work. Our workforce proposition is rooted in our purpose and values, and the principles of rewarding colleagues responsibly, recognising colleagues' success and supporting our colleagues to grow.\n\n## Rewarding colleagues responsibly\n\nWe believe in rewarding our colleagues responsibly, which means ensuring that our pay and benefits provide financial security for all. Our annual Performance and Reward survey measures several factors, including how colleagues feel about our reward proposition. In 2023, seven key performance indicators related to our year-end review improved by four or more percentage points, including a nine percentage point increase in colleagues who feel they are paid fairly for the work they do.\n\nAs part of our commitment to rewarding colleagues responsibly, we went beyond compliance in assessing statutory minimum wages, to ensure that all colleagues are paid at least a living wage.\n\nA living wage should be su/fficient to cover an adequate standard of living considering the cost of goods and services in each country and territory in which we operate. In 2023, we worked with the Fair Wage Network, which provided an independent source of wage levels. As a result, HSBC achieved accreditation as a global living wage employer in 2024. We will continue to review our pay levels to ensure that no colleague falls below a living wage level.\n\n- For further details of our approach to colleague remuneration, see page 290.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recognising colleagues' success\n\nWe are committed to recognising the achievements of our colleagues' success. Variable pay, which forms part of total compensation alongside fixed pay, allows us to recognise the performance and behaviours of our colleagues.\n\nAt the beginning of each year, we ask colleagues to set goals with support from their line managers to ensure they are aligned with the overall Group strategy and business priorities. As a result, 87% of colleagues said they have a clear understanding of what is expected of them throughout the year.\n\nWe expect our people managers to hold regular performance and development conversations to review progress, incorporate feedback and discuss well-being. In 2023, our Snapshot survey revealed that 81% of colleagues said they had regular performance conversations with their manager, while 63% had them at least once a month, up from 57% in 2022. These conversations also provide an opportunity for colleagues to regularly revisit any goals set to maintain the right level of challenge in their day-to-day work.\n\nAt year-end, employees are rated on both performance and behaviour. In our Pay and Benefits survey, 72% of colleagues said their year-end performance assessment fairly reflected their performance and 83% agreed that rating decisions were determined in an unbiased way, regardless of any protected characteristics or work patterns. In our Snapshot survey, 81% of employees said they receive feedback that helps them improve their performance, compared with 74% in 2022, and 81% feel motivated to do the best job they can, up from 78% last year.\n\nWe have continued to enhance our 'At Our Best' platform that allows colleagues to recognise each other's contributions, by providing mobile access to encourage realtime acts of appreciation. In 2023, colleagues made more than 1.4 million At Our Best recognitions, an increase of 13% from 2022.\n\nManagers are encouraged to recognise colleagues' service anniversaries every five years up to 40 years of service. This also includes the presentation of a special commemorative HSBC medallion. The At Our Best platform supports the global service recognition programme, which in 2023 helped to celebrate more than 30,000 service anniversaries.\n\nShare plans are another way to empower colleagues to participate in the Group's success and to have a share in the rewards. In 2023, we expanded our global share plan to include the Philippines, making it available to 91% of colleagues globally. Our 2020 threeyear Sharesave plan, in which 42% of UK employees took part, matured in November 2023. The share price at maturity represented more than double the option price, providing employees with significant share price growth. We ran information webinars, attended by more than 11,000 colleagues, and o/ffered support resources to help our colleagues understand tax considerations and the choices available to them at maturity.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues to grow\n\nTo help our colleagues to grow personally and professionally, we are committed to providing flexibility and choice around how, when and where they work, supporting their well-being, and helping them develop skills. The sections on the next page detail the ways in which we support our colleagues. For further details of our approach to skills and career development, see page 83.\n\n## Increasing social connection in the o/ffice\n\nSince the Covid-19 pandemic and the return of colleagues to the o/ffice, we identified the need for changes to improve team cohesion and a sense of belonging among our colleagues in Hong Kong. To help address, this we created a new type of work and social space at the HSBC Centre o/ffice in Kowloon, Hong Kong.\n\n'The Hub' is a flexible informal space that can be adapted to accommodate a range of di/fferent group activities and number of people, from large social events to smaller team training sessions. It is also designed to be a multi-level and interconnected space, with a central social meeting point to enhance the sense of community, improve levels of engagement and encourage greater social connection between colleagues.",

To support managers and colleagues to continue to find the right balance between individual flexibility and social connection, we have refreshed our training to equip managers with skills to lead flexible teams. In 2023, hybrid workers spent approximately 47% of their time in the workplace, compared with 36% in 2022.\n\nWe know that getting the balance right has a positive e/ffect on our colleagues. Colleagues who spend around 40% of their time in the workplace reported the highest positive sentiment across key employee indices, including engagement, trust and inclusion.\n\nWe track and measure responses from our Snapshot survey to ensure our broader approach to flexibility works for our customers and teams. A total of 81% of colleagues said they feel a genuine sense of belonging to their team, a two percentage point increase from 2022. A new question in the survey also found that 87% of new joiners feel they receive the right level of face-to-face support in order to succeed.\n\nIn the same survey, 76% of colleagues said they are able to integrate their work and personal life positively, a slight increase compared with 75% in 2022. To help the worklife balance of our colleagues, in Australia, we have introduced 20-weeks paid, genderneutral parental leave for when a child joins their family. Longer periods of paid parental leave have also been introduced in Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\n## Mental well-being\n\nSupporting the mental health of our colleagues remains a top priority. Cost-ofliving pressures and global crises continue to increase mental health challenges in many countries and territories. Our Snapshot survey revealed a slight decrease in mental well-being, with 83% of colleagues rating their mental health as positive, compared with 84% in 2022. However, it also found that 74% of colleagues feel comfortable talking to their manager about their mental health, and 77% said they know how to access mental health support at work. Both increased one percentage point compared with 2022.\n\nWe have continued to make the meditation app Headspace and counselling services available to all colleagues globally.\n\nMore than 200,000 colleagues took part in mental health awareness training as part of global mandatory training. Our voluntary mental health education modules have been completed by 31,000 employees, with people managers making up 74% of the completions. Our network of mindfulness champions, who are specially trained colleagues who volunteer to run mindfulness sessions, community events and courses for the benefit of fellow colleagues, has almost 200 members with representation in 22 countries and territories. In 2023, we held 1,400 mindfulness sessions, a 26% increase compared with 2022, and these were attended by 25,000 colleagues.\n\n## Physical well-being\n\nThe Snapshot survey also revealed an increase in physical well-being, with 74% of colleagues rating their physical health as positive, compared with 71% in 2022.\n\nIn February 2023, our Pay and Benefits survey showed that 69% of colleagues highly valued the health benefits we o/ffer, and 34% of colleagues wanted more support with physical activity and exercise. In response, we launched a platform called Virgin Pulse, which incentivises colleagues to set and track health goals, and to take part in active challenges. Since launching globally in November 2023, more than 5,700 colleagues have downloaded the app and more than 30 activity challenges have been run.\n\nWe have continued to provide access to private medical insurance as well as telemedicine healthcare services in the majority of our countries and territories, covering 98% of permanent employees. In certain countries and territories, we also provide on-site medical centres that the majority of colleagues can access.\n\n## Financial well-being\n\nWe recognise that financial challenges remain a concern for colleagues, caused by increases in the cost of living globally. Our Snapshot survey revealed a slight increase in financial well-being, with 61% of colleagues reporting positively, compared with 60% in 2022. Just over half (56%) of colleagues said they have at least three months of essential outgoings saved, the same as in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we ran campaigns in all regions to raise awareness of financial education and tools, and more than 1,000 colleagues attended our seminars on psychology and spending habits. We continue to o/ffer\n\n## Prioritising benefits that matter most to colleagues\n\nFor a second year our Pay and Benefits survey showed that 59% of colleagues feel their benefits meet their needs and those of their family 'well'. To improve sentiment, we have focused on enhancing benefits in areas that colleagues tell us are most important including health, saving for the future and time o/ff.\n\nCancer checks were made available to all UK colleagues, as early detection can result in higher survival rates. In the US, we have enhanced our fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits to support colleagues starting a family. We also expanded our gender dysphoria benefits for LGBTQ+ colleagues in the UK.\n\nCarer leave of five paid working days has also been introduced in the UAE, Egypt, Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, T\u00fcrkiye, Saudi Arabia and Mexico.\n\nTo help employees plan for their retirement, we became the first international bank to launch a defined contribution pension plan in Vietnam. We also implemented a new defined contribution plan in Guernsey and enhanced our retirement savings plan in Egypt, to support employees to plan for retirement with the benefit of employer contributions.\n\nretirement or longer-term savings plans to 95% of permanent employees, and our life insurance cover is available to 99.9% of colleagues to help provide financial security for their families.\n\n## Awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCCLA Global 100 Mental Health Benchmark\n\n-  Ranked number 1 global employer for the second consecutive year",

Our approach helps us meet our key strategic priorities and support our colleagues to achieve their career goals.\n\n## Our learning and skills platforms\n\nWe continue to evolve the opportunities to learn and develop at HSBC. We use a range of skill development platforms, learning courses and resources to help colleagues take ownership of their development and career, including:\n\n- - HSBC University, our home for learning and skills accessed online and through a network of training centres, where learning is organised through technical academies on topics of strategic importance;\n- - Degreed, our learning experience platform that provides access to internal and external learning content and courses, where colleagues can share, collaborate and learn with individuals and in groups via learning pathways;\n- - Talent Marketplace, our online platform that uses artificial intelligence ('AI') to match colleagues interested in developing specific skills or career goals with opportunities that exist throughout our global network; and\n- - Careers at HSBC, which enables all employees to set alerts and search for internal career opportunities.\n\n## Our learning fundamentals\n\nWe expect all colleagues, regardless of their contract type, to complete global mandatory training each year. This training plays a critical role in shaping our culture, ensuring a focus on the issues that are fundamental to our work, such as sustainability, financial crime risk and our intolerance of bullying and harassment. New joiners attend our Global Discovery programme, which is designed to build their knowledge of the organisation and engage with our purpose, values and strategy.\n\nAs the risks and opportunities our business faces change, our global academies adapt to o/ffer general and targeted development. Our Risk Academy provides learning for every employee in traditional areas of risk management such as financial crime risk, and also o/ffers more specific development for those in senior leadership, high-risk roles and learning for colleagues on emerging issues such as ESG risk, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and sanctions.\n\nWe have continued to deliver targeted skills programmes, including our Vision 27 programme that aims to ensure we are attracting, developing and retaining critical technology talent. We have also expanded our Accelerating Wealth Programme, which prioritises hiring for transferable skills rather than experience. For further details of how we are achieving our wealth goals in Asia, see page 84.\n\n## Building skills with Talent Marketplace\n\nOur people capability teams partner with businesses and functions to identify the key skills we need now and in the future. We also continue to support colleagues to develop new skills that achieve their career aspirations.\n\nWe have helped colleagues identify opportunities to enhance their skills through our Talent Marketplace. More than 38,000 colleagues have created a profile on the platform to help identify their existing skills and those they would like to develop. In 2023, it matched colleagues to a number of projects and networking opportunities unlocking over 123,000 hours of skills development.\n\nProjects centred around Cloud computing, data analytics, software development and project management have created opportunities for colleagues to work on indemand skills.\n\n## Training at HSBC\n\nIn 2023, we continued to enable colleagues to learn via a range of channels including digital and on-the-job learning. This is reflected in a reduction in overall learning hours as colleagues access di/fferent learning channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining hours by our colleagues in 2023. (2022: 6.3 million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining hours per FTE in 2023. (2022: 28.8 hours)\n\n## Identifying and retaining future talent\n\nThe need for talent is greater than ever. In 2023, a further 9,000 managers completed our compulsory inclusive hiring training, promoting cognitive awareness of bias. Our targeted talent programmes and enterprise-wide solutions are designed to support employees transitioning to more complex roles, and provide wider career opportunities and career growth.\n\nOur recruitment programmes are a key enabler of achieving our broader diversity goals (see page 76). In 2023, we welcomed more than 720 graduates and 651 interns to the organisation. The graduate intake represented 48 nationalities, over 25 ethnic backgrounds, and 51% were women. In 2023, we continued to broaden our emerging talent programmes beyond traditional graduate and internship programmes, developing early access schemes for those in school and first year of university, as well as expanding our apprenticeship scheme (see page 84).\n\nWe continually refresh all our talent programmes to ensure they remain aligned to HSBC's strategic priorities. Our key programmes include:\n\n- - Accelerating Female Leaders, which has been re-designed in partnership with Cranfield School of Management. This programme supports female colleagues with learning materials, coaching and senior sponsorship to help them prepare for leadership roles; and\n- - Accelerating into Leadership, which aims to improve role mobility and retention, and supports colleagues identified as having the capacity, interest and drive to succeed in more complex roles.",

It is vital that we demonstrate the right leadership and create the right environment to energise our colleagues for growth.\n\n## Skilling the transition to net zero\n\nThe Sustainability Academy was launched in 2022 to support our net zero ambitions. As the academy has evolved we have shifted the focus from knowledge building to capability building across key colleague groups who are supporting customers on their transition to net zero. In 2023, we applied four main activities to support this e/ffort:\n\n- - supplying on-demand learning modules based on role, region and client-base for colleagues who support customers with core transition activities;\n- - creating advanced workshops across our global businesses and functions to build colleagues' knowledge and develop practical skills to achieve business outcomes;\n- - encouraging external certifications and qualifications, where required, to deepen colleagues' expertise; and\n- - designing a 16-week sustainability leadership programme, in partnership with Imperial College London, which combines education on core sustainability concepts with change management, purpose and leadership principles. In 2023, the programme was completed by more than 170 senior leaders. Additional net zero learning opportunities were also provided to the Board and 100 of our most senior leaders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe need to build strong leadership and develop our colleagues' capabilities to navigate the transition to net zero and achieve our climate goals. In 2023, we worked with our internal experts from the Sustainability Centre of Excellence to provide more advanced skills training in key transition areas such as energy transition, climate technology and financed emissions, alongside other core sustainability topics such as biodiversity.\n\n## Supporting our Asia wealth strategy\n\nOur ambition is to become the preferred international financial partner for clients, and the expansion of our wealth management services particularly in Asia, sits at the heart of this ambition.\n\nTo help achieve this, we have continued to expand our Accelerating Wealth Programme, which o/ffers a skills-based development plan for colleagues who are looking to pursue a career as a relationship manager in wealth management. The programme enables HSBC to develop talent from within and hire talented people with di/fferent career backgrounds from outside the business. In 2023, we extended the programme to external applicants in Hong Kong and to internal applicants in mainland China, India and Singapore. We will continue to add new countries and territories in 2024 to provide a sustainable hiring channel for frontline roles.\n\n## Technology transformation\n\nWe are committed to delivering better customer outcomes through digital transformation. Our technology transformation skills programme aims to ensure we attract, develop and retain the skilled talent we need to execute our strategy.\n\nIn 2023, our technology colleagues completed more than 800,000 hours of learning and gained over 950 certifications in software development, cyber, AI, data processes, Cloud computing and app development, among others. Our new Principle Engineer and Principle Architecture accelerator programmes have equipped colleagues with advanced technical knowledge and skills, enhancing their ability to innovate in their roles.\n\n## Leadership development\n\nWe continue to strengthen the training and development opportunities we o/ffer our leaders at all levels of the Group, to ensure they are equipped with the clarity, alignment and capability with our goals to drive the performance of our organisation. In 2023, we significantly increased investment in the development of our leadership population.\n\nFor senior leaders, our Executive and Managing Director Leadership Programmes helped bring our purpose and strategy to life through innovative flagship courses, masterclasses and strategy briefing sessions.\n\nWe recognise the importance of people managers in shaping the experience of our colleagues. In 2023, we re-designed our People Management Excellence programme to better support managers at all levels. The face-to-face and virtual training includes a focus on the role and expectations of managers, how to design and organise work, and how to nurture a productive team environment. In 2023, over 3,800 colleagues attended this programme.\n\n## Supporting UK emerging talent\n\nWe continue to extend our emerging talent programmes beyond traditional graduate and internship schemes to support our socio-economic diversity ambitions (see page 78). In 2023, we awarded more than 100 apprenticeships to external and internal applicants. Our degree apprenticeship programmes provided an alternative to the traditional university route for 47 individuals, and we launched a disability apprenticeship programme for our Marketing function. We have also o/ffered over 460 structured work placements to secondary school students and continued to support the #merkybook financial literacy programme for young people.\n\nHSBC has funded 30 University of Cambridge scholarships for Black and socially disadvantaged students through our Stormzy partnership, and will invest a further \u00a32m to achieve 60 scholarships by 2026 to support underrepresented groups. In 2023, Black heritage representation in our graduate and summer internship programmes was 10% of job applicants and 11% of new hires.",

We are playing an active role in opening up a world of opportunity for individuals by supporting their financial well-being, and removing the di/fferent barriers that people can face in accessing financial services.\n\n## Access to products and services\n\nWe provide innovative solutions to help improve customer access to products and services. HSBC UK and HSBC Hong Kong provide no-cost accounts for customers who do not qualify for a standard account or who might need additional support due to social or financial vulnerability. In 2023, HSBC Egypt ran a campaign that allowed new customers to open bank accounts with no minimum balance required and no account opening fees. In the UK, we continue to make our branches more accessible by providing 'safe spaces' for domestic abuse victims, where they can seek specialist support and advice. In 2023, we also launched a specialist training programme to raise awareness among our colleagues of modern slavery and human tra/fficking. This has been completed by more than 5,300 UK colleagues. In addition, our strategic partnership with housing and homelessness charity Shelter UK aims to support those in crisis and build financial resilience solutions to help prevent homelessness in the future.\n\n## Making banking accessible\n\nNumber of no-cost accounts held for customers who do not qualify for a standard account or who might need additional support due to social or financial vulnerability.\n\n|   2023 | 718,306   |\n|--------|-----------|\n|   2022 | 716,957   |\n|   2021 | 692,655   |\n\n## Supporting financial knowledge and education\n\nWe continue to invest in financial education content and features across di/fferent channels to help customers, colleagues and communities be confident users of financial services.\n\nSince 2020, we received over 6.6 million unique visitors to our global digital financial education content. We continue to help customers expand their financial capabilities through our personal financial management tools. In 2023, HSBC UK launched new capabilities on our app enabling customers to manage their budgets, see their spending\n\ninsights and view financial fitness content. This new tab on the app has attracted over 4.5 million unique visitors. We also added investment pots and goals to help motivate customers to save for the future.\n\nIn 2022, we launched our 'Well+' reward programme on the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app to help customers improve the health of their body, money and mind. Reward points are earned by completing a series of simple activities, such as building their financial knowledge. In 2023, we added new capabilities, such as bonus badges, and more than 212,000 customers have engaged with Well+ in Hong Kong since launch.\n\nTo help customers understand complex products and make informed decisions, HSBC Life UK launched a series of quick video guides to explain the key benefits, exclusions and underwriting process of critical illness cover.\n\nTo support Hong Kong customers with special educational needs, we launched simple step-by-step guides, which were shared with our partners, to explain how to access basic banking services.\n\nWe also support programmes that help expand the financial knowledge of children and young people to ensure future resilience. HSBC Egypt partnered with Injaz Al-Arab, a member of JA Worldwide, to deliver its 'building a financially capable generation' programme to students in seven schools in Cairo. In Mexico, we created a podcast, targeted at developing the financial capabilities of young people with each episode covering a specific theme, to enhance their basic financial knowledge.\n\nWe continued to build on our financial literacy programmes for young people in the UK, with the launch of the first financial capability skills module for the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\n\n## Creating an inclusive banking experience\n\nWe aim to ensure that our banking products and services are designed to be accessible for customers experiencing either temporary or permanent challenging circumstances, such as disability, impairment or a major life event.\n\nA simplified version of the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app aims to continue to enhance digital inclusion for all, including seniors. The app is the first of its kind among Hong Kong banks and has attracted more than 477,000 unique users since launch.\n\nWe are committed to improving accessibility experiences across our digital channels and continuously review our browser-based websites in 23 markets, and our mobile banking services in 18 markets, against the WCAG 2.0 AA standards. We also share our digital accessibility expertise with partners, companies and colleagues. More than 10,000 people and 66 companies have taken advantage of our specialised training programmes. To further share our best practice externally, HSBC sponsored and hosted AbilityNet's Techshare Pro event in our Group head o/ffice in London. Our work on digital accessibility was recognised with 11 awards in 2023.\n\nSupport for customers extends beyond our digital channels and we recognise that not all disabilities are visible or immediately obvious to others. We have expanded our commitment to the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Lanyard Scheme, rolling it out across the UK, Hong Kong, the Channel Islands and Australia. The lanyard indicates that an individual may need a little more help, support or time. HSBC UK is also making use of virtual reality tools, such as EBOX (Empathy Box), to give colleagues the opportunity to experience vulnerability from the perspective of the customer.\n\nIn 2023, HSBC UK was awarded the UK Construction Industry Council's Inclusive Environments Recognition at the Organisational Level certification. This recognises the strong organisation and design processes HSBC has put in place to support accessible and inclusive design.\n\n## Supporting women\n\nHSBC UAE and HSBC Singapore have collaborated with digital financial education provider Sophia, to create a programme designed specifically to help female customers build their financial knowledge. It covers a range of topics, including budgeting, ways to invest and investment strategies.\n\nIn Mexico, our Mujeres Al Mundo programme continues to support women as customers through products, services, education and networking. In 2023, we also supported female-owned businesses through our $1bn Female Entrepreneur Fund, alongside hosting bespoke Pitch Day events for a number of female entrepreneurs seeking investment.",

We also seek to ensure we respect global standards on human rights in our workplace and our supply chains, and continually work to improve our compliance management capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our corporate governance, see our corporate governance report on page 238.\n\n## In this section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Setting high  standards of  governance   | How ESG is governed                    | We expect that our approach to ESG governance is likely to continue  to develop, in line with our evolving approach to ESG matters and  stakeholder expectations.                            | Page  88   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Human rights                             | Our respect for   human rights         | We have continued to raise awareness and develop our  understanding of our salient human rights issues.                                                                                      | Page  89   |\n| Customer  experience                     | Customer satisfaction                  | While we are ranked in the top three banks against our competitors in  58% of our key markets across WPB and CMB, we still have work to  do to improve our rank position against competitors | Page  91   |\n|                                          | How we listen                          | We aim to be open and transparent in how we track, record and  manage complaints.                                                                                                            | Page  92   |\n| Integrity, conduct  and fairness         | Safeguarding the financial system      | We have continued our e/fforts to combat financial crime and reduce  its impact on our organisation, customers and communities that   we serve.                                              | Page  94   |\n|                                          | Whistleblowing                         | Our global whistleblowing channel, HSBC Confidential, allows our  colleagues and other stakeholders to raise concerns confidentially.                                                        | Page  94   |\n|                                          | A responsible   approach to tax        | We seek to pay our fair share of tax in all jurisdictions in which   we operate.                                                                                                             | Page  95   |\n|                                          | Conduct: Our product  responsibilities | Our conduct approach guides us to do the right thing and to focus on  the impact we have on our customers and the geographies in which  we operate.                                          | Page  96   |\n|                                          | Our approach with our suppliers        | We require suppliers to meet our third-party risk compliance  standards and we assess them to identify any financial   stability concerns.                                                   | Page  96   |\n| Safeguarding data                        | Data privacy                           | We are committed to protecting and respecting the data we hold and  process, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the markets  in which we operate.                                | Page  97   |\n|                                          | Cybersecurity                          | We invest in our business and technical controls to help prevent,  detect and mitigate cyber threats.                                                                                        | Page  98   |",

Progress against our ESG ambitions is reviewed through Board discussion and review of key topics such as updates on customer experience and employee sentiment. The Board is regularly provided with specific updates on ESG matters, including the financed emissions sector targets, human rights and employee well-being. Board members receive ESGrelated training as part of their induction and ongoing development, and seek out further opportunities to build their skills and experience in this area. For further details of Board members' ESG skills and experience, see page 239. For further details of their induction and training in 2023, see page 253.\n\nGiven the wide-ranging remit of ESG matters, the governance activities are managed through a combination of specialist governance infrastructure and regular meetings and committees, where appropriate. These include the Group Disclosure and Controls Committee and Group Audit Committee, which provide oversight for the scope and content of ESG disclosures, and the Group People Committee, which provides oversight support for the Group's approach to performance management. For some areas, such as climate where our approach is more advanced, dedicated governance activities exist to support the wide range of activities, including climate risk management in the Environmental Risk Oversight Forum.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance O/fficer and the chief risk o/fficers of our PRAregulated businesses are the senior managers responsible for climate financial risks under the UK Senior Managers Regime. Climate risks are considered in the Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee, with scheduled updates provided, as well as detailed reviews of material matters, such as climate-related stress testing exercises.\n\nThe diagram on the right provides an illustration of our ESG governance process, including how the Board's strategy on climate is cascaded and implemented throughout the organisation. It identifies examples of forums that manage both climate-related opportunities and risks, along with their responsibilities and the responsible chair. The structure of the process is similar for the escalation of problems, with issues either resolved in a given forum or raised to the appropriate level of governance with appropriate scope and authority.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our ESG governance with the establishment of a new Sustainability Execution Committee, which focuses on\n\ndefining and measuring the success of our climate ambition, and developing commercial opportunities that support it through the sustainability execution programme.\n\nWe expect that our approach to ESG governance is likely to continue to develop, in line with our evolving approach to ESG matters and stakeholder expectations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Examples of ESG-related management governance\n\nThe following governance bodies support management in its delivery of ESG activities.\n\nDigital Business Services Executive Committee Oversees the global delivery of ESG activities within our own operations, services and technology elements of our strategy.\n\nChair: Group Chief Operating O/fficer\n\n## Group Reputational Risk Committee\n\nProvides recommendations and advice on significant reputational risk matters with impact across the Group.\n\nChair: Group Chief Risk and Compliance O/fficer\n\nHuman Rights Steering Committee Oversees the Group's evolving approach to human rights and provides enhanced governance.\n\nChair: Group Chief Risk and Compliance O/fficer",

Our approach is guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ('UNGPs') and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct.\n\n## Our salient human rights issues\n\nWe continue to raise awareness and develop our understanding of our salient human rights issues. These are the human rights at risk of the most severe negative impact through our business activities and relationships.\n\nAn extensive review of our salient human rights issues conducted in 2022 identified five human rights risks inherent to HSBC's business globally, and five types of activity through which such risks might arise. These are represented in the adjacent table.\n\nIn 2023, building on this assessment, we provided practical guidance and training, where relevant, to our colleagues across the Group on how to identify and manage human rights risk.\n\nWe are now focusing on translating this into risk management enhancements in two key areas of activity. These are the services we provide to business customers and the goods and services we buy from third parties.\n\n## Managing risks to human rights\n\nIn 2023, we continued the process of adapting our risk management procedures to reflect what we learned from our work on salient human rights issues and related guidance.\n\nWe continued to embed and build on the Sustainable Procurement Mandatory Procedure, which sets out the minimum sustainability requirements for procurement activity. This included enhanced procedures for human rights risk identification through the introduction of a human rights residual risk questionnaire for suppliers as part of our global onboarding assessment process, and human rights supplier audit pilots in our AsiaPacific and Latin America regions to assess the potential need for further supplier audits in the future.\n\nNew approaches to identifying and managing human rights risk in respect of our business customers have also been piloted. These included screening for indicators of potential negative impacts on people, including media monitoring and other relevant third-party data.\n\n## Our salient human rights issues\n\nIllustration of HSBC Group's inherent human rights risks mapped to business activities.\n\n|                               |                                         | HSBC activities   | HSBC activities                    | HSBC activities                    | HSBC activities                    | HSBC activities   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                               |                                         |                   | Provider of products and  services | Provider of products and  services | Provider of products and  services |                   |\n| Inherent human rights risks   | Inherent human rights risks             | Employer          | Buyer                              | Personal  customers                | Business  customers                | Investor 1        |\n| Right to  decent  work        | Freedom from   forced labour            |                   | \u25c6                                  |                                    | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n|                               | Just and favourable  conditions of work | \u25c6                 | \u25c6                                  |                                    | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n|                               | Right to health and   safety at work    | \u25c6                 | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n| Right to equality and freedom | from discrimination                     | \u25c6                 | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n| Right to privacy              |                                         | \u25c6                 |                                    | \u25c6                                  |                                    | \u25c6                 |\n| Cultural and land rights      |                                         |                   | \u25c6                                  |                                    | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n| Right to dignity and justice  |                                         | \u25c6                 | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                                  | \u25c6                 |\n\n- 1 Investor includes our activities in HSBC Asset Management.\n\nWe continued to develop our in-house capability on human rights with the launch of further online resources for all sta/ff and bespoke human rights training for colleagues in key roles, including those managing relationships with suppliers, and those with responsibility for overseeing risk management processes.\n\nThe actions we are taking to address these salient human rights issues are consistent with our values and will help us to meet our commitments on diversity and inclusion, and those we have made under the UN Global Compact and WEF metrics on risk for incidents of child, forced or compulsory labour.\n\n- For further details of the actions taken to respect the right to decent work, see our 2023 Annual Statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act at www.hsbc.com/modernslaveryact.\n- For further details of the actions taken to respect the right to equality and freedom from discrimination, see 'Our approach to diversity and inclusion' on page 76.\n\n## Sustainability risk policies\n\nSome of our business customers operate in sectors where the risk of adverse human rights impact is high. Our sustainability risk policies for agricultural commodities, energy, forestry, mining and metals consider human rights issues such as forced labour, harmful or exploitative child labour and land rights. They also consider the rights of indigenous peoples such as 'free prior and informed consent', workers' rights, and the health and safety of communities.\n\nThrough our membership of international certification schemes such as the Forestry Stewardship Council, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Equator Principles, we support standards aimed at respecting human rights.\n\nOur sustainability risk policies are reviewed periodically to ensure they reflect our priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details, see our sustainability risk policies at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/managing-risk/ sustainability-risk.\n\n## Financial crime controls\n\nThe risk of us causing, contributing or being linked to adverse human rights impacts is also mitigated by our financial crime risk framework, which includes our global policies and associated controls.\n\n- For further details of how we fight financial crime, see www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ esg-and-responsible-business/ fighting-financial-crime.",

We are a participant of its monthly financial services working group, and we use its informative typological toolkits, infographics, and other multimedia resources covering current and emerging issues. Our Compliance teams regularly collaborate and engage with the Mekong Club in designing Group-wide knowledge sharing and training sessions.\n\n## Investments\n\nSince 2022, HSBC Asset Management has published an annual Global Stewardship Plan outlining its approach to engagement, prioritisation of investee companies, objectivesetting and escalation procedures. The plan also highlights its thematic priorities including human rights.\n\nHSBC Asset Management recognises collaborative engagement as a tool to promote change. It participates in investor-led joint engagement initiatives where it believes these can have a positive influence. It is a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment Advance initiative to promote active stewardship on human rights and social issues. It has also actively contributed to other sector-specific initiatives, including engaging with technology firms on digital rights and responsible AI, and working with ESG data providers to promote higher quality human rights data set.\n\nHSBC Asset Management has also incorporated human rights and modern slavery considerations into its Global Voting Guidelines. This helps to identify non-compliance with UN Global Compact principles, as well as a company's competency in human rights management and disclosures. Where a company falls below expectations, HSBC Asset Management may vote against the re-election of the board chair or relevant board director.\n\nAs a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, HSBC Asset Management is taking steps to reduce the carbon exposure of its portfolios and engage with issuers on their climate strategies. It also recognises the impact that the climate transition can have on workers, communities, consumers and other stakeholders, and has published its perspectives on a just transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For the Global Stewardship Plan, see www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/-/media/files/ attachments/uk/policies/stewardship-plan-uk.pdf.\n- For further details of the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, see www. assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/institutionalinvestor/about-us/road-to-net-zero/a-transitionfor-everyone.\n\n## Supporting those impacted and those potentially at risk\n\nWe continued to expand our Survivor Bank programme, which has now supported over 3,000 survivors of modern slavery and human tra/fficking in the UK, and is a model for making financial services more accessible to vulnerable communities worldwide.\n\nWe built on this experience in developing access to banking services for customers with no fixed abode in the UK and in Hong Kong, providing over 5,700 accounts under these programmes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our work to support vulnerable communities, see page 86.\n\n## E/ffectiveness\n\nThe table below includes some indicative metrics we use to measure year-on-year continual improvement to our human rights processes.\n\n- For further diversity and inclusion metrics, see page 76 in this ESG review, as well as Section 4 of the 2023 Annual Statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act, which is available at www. hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsiblebusiness/modern-slavery-act.\n\n## Monitoring e/ffectiveness\n\n| Metric                                                                                                                                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Contracted suppliers who either confirmed adherence to the code of  conduct or provided their own alternative that was accepted by our  Global Procurement function | 95%    | 93%    |\n| Employees who have received training on human rights                                                                                                                | 8,176  | 520    |\n| Votes by HSBC Asset Management against management for reasons  including human rights 1                                                                             | 213    | 87     |\n\n- 1  The figure represents the number of resolutions at investee company shareholder meetings (including AGMs) where votes were cast against management for reasons related to human rights.\n\n## Working for a just transition\n\nJust Energy Transition Partnerships are becoming increasingly popular bringing key stakeholders together to enable a clean, fair energy transition in emerging economies that rely heavily on coal.

        "page_content": "## Customer experience\n\nWe remain committed to improving customers' experiences. In 2023, we gathered feedback from over one million customers across our three global businesses to help us understand our strengths and the areas we need to focus on. We were ranked among the top three banks against our competitors in 58% of our six key markets across WPB and CMB 1 . This was lower than in 2022 when we were ranked among the top three banks against our competitors in 66% of our key markets.\n\n## Customer satisfaction\n\n## Listening to drive improvement\n\nWe have continued to embed our feedback system so we can better listen, learn and act on our customers' feedback. We use the net promoter score ('NPS') to provide a consistent measure of our performance. NPS is measured by subtracting the percentage of 'detractors' from the percentage of 'promoters'. 'Detractors' are customers who provide a score of 0 to 6, and 'promoters' are customers who provide a score of 9 to 10 to the question: 'On a scale on 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend HSBC to a friend or colleague'.\n\nWe run studies that allow us to benchmark ourselves against other banks. We try to make it as easy as possible for customers to give us feedback, accelerating our use of digital realtime surveys to capture insight. By sharing this and other feedback with our front-line teams, and allowing them to respond directly to customers, we are improving how we address issues and realise opportunities.\n\n## Acting on feedback\n\nWe have continued to focus on developing our products and services, and enhancing our digital capabilities to improve customer experience.\n\nIn WPB, we redesigned our international products and services to make it quicker and easier to bank internationally. This involved the launch of six products and services across 10 international markets. International customers can open an international account digitally pre-departure, gain access to a credit card in their new market, and make use of cross-border payment solutions with 24/7 global support to manage their international needs.\n\nIn 2023, we launched the CMB Customer Impact Forum, a dedicated global forum set up to provide oversight of our business and corporate customers' experiences and promote continuous improvement. This, alongside our WPB 'Customer in the room' programme launched in 2022, helps ensure we use feedback in all aspects of how we run our business and prioritise initiatives that matter most to our customers.\n\n## How we fared\n\nIn WPB, our NPS increased in four of our six key markets, which were Hong Kong, Mexico, India and Singapore. Our NPS in the UK declined slightly, largely among our mass a/ffluent customers. In Hong Kong, we remained first overall against our competitors, driven by our mass a/ffluent customers. In India we ranked in first place, driven by increased digitalisation. We introduced digital self-service solutions for updating customer details and downloading key documents, and digitised our onboarding process. We were also a top three bank in mainland China, based on 2022 data (see footnote 3 in the adjacent table).\n\nIn our private bank, our global NPS increased to 42 points, compared with 25 points in 2022. This was largely due to increased customer satisfaction in Asia, with improved scores in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and mainland China. This was driven by relationship manager engagement and enhancements to our digital services.\n\nIn CMB, we introduced a new credit application system, the Digital Credit Portal, in 15 markets. It uses internal and external data combined with automation to streamline credit journeys. In Hong Kong, the portal also integrates with a credit decision engine to automate credit decisions for qualifying customers, reducing the assessment time on loan approvals from days to as little as a few minutes. Our digital onboarding tool, SmartServe, has been implemented in 21 markets to support international and domestic account opening. We have onboarded 89% of eligible customers through the digital platform, with 72% of customers rating this experience as 'easy'.\n\nIn CMB, we were ranked among the top three banks against our competitors in four of our six key markets. We ranked first in Hong Kong and as a top three bank in mainland China, Singapore and Mexico. In India and the UK, we were ranked outside the top three. Our NPS rank improved in the UK, driven by our business banking customers and our top three ranking among UK corporate customers. Our NPS declined slightly among our mid-market enterprise customers.\n\nIn GBM, we had one of the highest NPS scores in the market against our competitors, including the quality of our digital trade finance platforms and for satisfaction with our digital capabilities.\n\n## Number of markets in top three or improving rank 1,2\n\n|       | 2023       |\n|-------|------------|\n| WPB 3 | 3 out of 6 |\n| CMB   | 5 out of 6 |\n\n- 2  We benchmark our NPS against our key competitors to create a rank position in each market. This table is based is on the number of markets where we are in the top three or have improved rank from the previous year.\n- 3  Our WPB NPS ranking in mainland China is based on 2022 results. Due to data integrity challenges, we are unable to produce a 2023 ranking. The next mainland China results will be in 2024.\n\nIn GBM, we continued to execute our strategy and refine the client coverage model. In 2023, we accelerated our 'originate-to-distribute' model, providing clients with an e/ffective capital e/fficiency strategy. We have refinanced our in-country and cross-border coverage model in mainland China and refreshed our growth plans in India based on client feedback. We also launched growth initiatives against our Asia-MENAT corridor to better service our clients.",

We continue to adapt at pace to provide support for customers facing new challenges, new ways of working and those that require enhanced care needs.\n\nWe aim to be open and consistent in how we track, record and manage complaints, although as we serve a wide range of customers - from personal banking and wealth customers to large corporates, institutions and governments - we tailor our approach in each of our global businesses. As the table on the right demonstrates, we have a consistent set of principles that enable us to remain customer-focused throughout the complaints process.\n\n- For further details of complaints volumes by geography, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\n## How we handle complaints\n\n| Our actions                                                                                                                                                                                    | Our principles                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Customers can complain through the channel that best suits them.

The ratio of complaints per 1,000 customers per month in our large markets remained stable at around 2.3.\n\nIn the UK, complaints fell 19%. In 2023, we applied the new UK Consumer Duty rules to our complaint handling processes and invested in root cause analysis to ensure good outcomes and avoid instances of foreseeable harm. We will continue to focus on enhancing our processes and on training complaint handlers to improve the customer experience and reduce our complaint volumes further.\n\nThe decrease in complaints in Hong Kong was primarily driven by improvements in our digital capabilities to make it easier for customers to connect with us. Regular reviews, analysis of customer feedback and greater collaboration across business lines to address emerging customer pain points also contributed to the fall in complaints.\n\n| WPB complaint volumes 1 (per 1,000 customers per month)   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total 2                                                   |    2.3 |    2.3 |\n| UK 3                                                      |    1.1 |    1.4 |\n| Hong Kong 3                                               |    0.9 |    1   |\n| Mexico 3                                                  |    5.2 |    5.1 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2  Markets included: Hong Kong, mainland China, France, the UK, UAE, Mexico, Canada and the US.\n- 3  The UK, Mexico and Hong Kong make up 86% of total complaints.\n\nIn response to an increase in credit and debit card fraud attacks in Mexico during the first quarter of 2023, we focused on strengthening our monitoring and fraud detection capabilities to help protect our customers. In October, we also released the new Visa Account Attack Intelligence tool to mitigate foreign e-commerce attacks on customer debit cards. As a result of these e/fforts, average monthly complaints in Mexico for the last nine months of the year decreased by 20.5% compared with the first quarter.\n\nIn our private bank, we received 507 complaints, an increase of 176 compared with 2022. This was largely due to growth in our customer base since establishing new private banking operations in the UAE and Mexico, along with an increase in complaints in the US. This led to an increase in administration and service issues, a high proportion of which were attributable to delays and errors in processing client instructions. Overall, the private bank resolved 465 complaints. Complaint data for the new private banking operation in India was reported within the WPB figures, pending system development to separately report the complaint figures.\n\n## Acting on feedback\n\nIn 2023, we continued to develop and embed tools and capabilities across our business to deliver improved experiences for our customers around the world. Through our measurement of customer experience, we identify opportunities for improvement, develop agile customer experience plans and track and measure our progress. As a result of standardising our approach to customer experience globally, we have strengthened our capability to listen, understand and act on what our customers are telling us on a regular basis.",

Financial crime includes fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions and export control violations, money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\n\nWe manage financial crime risk because it is the right thing to do to protect our customers, shareholders, sta/ff, the communities in which we operate, as well as the integrity of the financial system on which we all rely. We have a financial crime risk management framework that is applicable across all global businesses and functions, and in all countries and territories in which we operate. The financial crime risk framework, which is overseen by the Board, is supported by our financial crime policy that is designed to enable adherence to applicable laws and regulations globally. Annual global mandatory training is provided to all colleagues, with additional targeted training tailored to certain individuals. We carry out regular risk assessments to identify where we need to respond to evolving financial crime threats, as well as to monitor and test our financial crime risk management programme.\n\nWe continue to invest in new technology, including through the deployment of a capability to monitor correspondent banking activity.

We o/ffer a range of speak-up channels to listen to the concerns of individuals and have a zero tolerance policy for acts of retaliation.\n\n## Listening through whistleblowing channels\n\nOur global whistleblowing channel, HSBC Confidential, is one of our speak-up channels, which allows colleagues and other stakeholders to raise concerns confidentially and, if preferred, anonymously (subject to local laws). In most of our markets, HSBC Confidential concerns are raised through an independent third party, o/ffering 24/7 hotlines and a web portal in multiple languages. We also provide and monitor an external email address for concerns about accounting, internal financial controls or auditing matters (accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com). Concerns are investigated proportionately and independently, with action taken where appropriate. This can include disciplinary action, such as dismissal and adjustments\n\nmonitoring capability and our trade screening controls, and investing in the application of machine learning to improve the accuracy and timeliness of our detection capabilities.\n\nThese new technologies should enhance our ability to respond e/ffectively to unusual activity and be more granular in our risk assessments. This helps us to protect our customers, the organisation and the integrity of the global financial system against financial crime.\n\n## Our anti-bribery and corruption policy\n\nOur global financial crime policy requires that all activity must be: conducted without intent to bribe or corrupt; reasonable and transparent; considered to not be lavish nor disproportionate to the professional relationship; appropriately documented with business rationale; and authorised at an appropriate level of seniority. There were no concluded legal cases regarding bribery or corruption brought against HSBC or its employees in 2023. Our global financial crime policy requires that we identify and mitigate the risk of our customers and third parties committing bribery or corruption. Among other controls, we use customer due diligence and transaction monitoring to identify and help mitigate the risk that our customers are involved in bribery or corruption. We perform anti-bribery and corruption risk assessments on third parties that expose us to this risk.\n\nto variable pay and performance ratings, or operational actions including changes to policies and procedures.\n\nWe actively promote our full range of speakup channels to colleagues to help ensure their concerns are handled through the most e/ffective route. In 2023, 4% fewer concerns were raised through HSBC Confidential compared with 2022. Of the concerns investigated through the HSBC Confidential channel in 2023, 81% related to individual behaviour and personal conduct, 14% to security and fraud risks, 4% to compliance risks and less than 1% to other categories.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee has oversight of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements, and the Chair of the Group Audit Committee acts as HSBC's Whistleblowers' Champion with responsibility for ensuring and overseeing the integrity, independence and e/ffectiveness of the Group's policies and procedures.\n\nRegulatory Compliance sets the whistleblowing policy and procedures, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The scale of our work\n\nEach month, on average, we monitor over 1.35 billion transactions for signs of financial crime.

        "page_content": "## A responsible approach to tax\n\nWe seek to pay our fair share of tax in all jurisdictions in which we operate, and to minimise the likelihood of customers using our products and services to evade or inappropriately avoid tax. We also abide by international protocols that a/ffect our organisation. Our approach to tax and governance processes is designed to achieve these goals.\n\nThrough adoption of the Group's risk management framework, we seek to ensure that we do not adopt inappropriately taxmotivated transactions or products, and that tax planning is scrutinised and supported by genuine commercial activity. HSBC has no appetite for using aggressive tax structures.\n\nWith respect to our own taxes, we are guided by the following principles:\n\n- - We are committed to applying both the letter and spirit of the law. This includes adherence to a variety of measures arising from the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative including the 'Pillar Two' global minimum tax rules which will apply to the Group from 2024. These rules seek to ensure that the Group pays tax at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which it operates. We have identified 12 jurisdictions that may have an e/ffective tax rate below 15% in 2024. We continually monitor the number of active subsidiaries within each jurisdiction as part of our ongoing entity rationalisation programme.\n\nTaxes paid - by type of tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - We seek to ensure that our entities active in nil or low tax jurisdictions have clear business rationale for why they are based in these locations and appropriate transparency over their activities.\n- - We seek to have open and transparent relationships with all tax authorities. Given the size and complexity of our organisation, which operates across over 60 jurisdictions, a number of areas of di/ffering interpretation or disputes with tax authorities exist at any point in time. We cooperate with the relevant local tax authorities to mutually agree and resolve these in a timely manner.\n\nWith respect to our customers' taxes, we are guided by the following principles:\n\n- - We have made considerable investments to support external tax transparency initiatives and reduce the risk of banking services being used to facilitate customer tax evasion. Initiatives include the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information ('Common Reporting Standard'), and the UK legislation on the corporate criminal o/ffence of failing to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion.\n\nTaxes paid - by region\n\nTaxes collected - by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Other duties and levies includes property taxes of $91m (2022: $94m)\n- - We implement processes that aim to ensure that inappropriately tax-motivated products and services are not provided to our customers.\n\n## Our tax contributions\n\nThe e/ffective tax rate for the year of 19.1% was higher than in the previous year (2022: 4.7%). The e/ffective tax rate for the year was increased by 2.3% from the non-taxable impairment of the Group's interest in BoCom, and reduced by 1.6% by the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions and by 1.5% by the non-taxable provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. Further details are provided on page 369.\n\nThe UK bank levy charge for 2023 of $339m was higher than the charge of $13m in 2022, mainly due to adjustments arising upon filing prior year returns, which represented a credit in 2022 and a charge in 2023.\n\nAs highlighted below, in addition to paying $6.8bn of our own tax liabilities during 2023, we collected taxes of $10.8bn on behalf of governments around the world.

It is embedded into the way we design, approve, market and manage products and services, with a focus on five clear outcomes:\n\n- - We understand our customers' needs.\n- - We provide products and services that o/ffer a fair exchange of value.\n- - We service customers' ongoing needs and put it right if we make a mistake.\n- - We act with integrity in the financial markets we operate in.\n- - We operate resiliently and securely to avoid harm to customers and markets.\n\nWe train all our colleagues on our approach to customer and market conduct, helping to ensure our conduct outcomes are part of everything we do.\n\n## Designing products and services\n\nOur approach to product development is set out in our policies and provides a clear basis on which informed decisions can be made. Our policies require that products must be fit-for-purpose throughout their existence, meeting regulatory requirements and associated conduct outcomes.\n\nOur approach includes:\n\n- - designing products to meet identified customer needs;\n- - managing products through governance processes, helping to ensure they meet customers' needs and deliver a fair exchange of value;\n- - periodically reviewing products to help ensure they remain relevant and perform in line with expectations we have set; and\n- - improving, or withdrawing from sale, products which do not meet our customers' needs or no longer meet our high standards.\n\n## Meeting our customers' needs\n\nOur policies and procedures set standards to ensure that we consider and meet customer needs. These include:\n\n- - enabling customers to understand the key features of products and services;\n- - enabling customers to make informed decisions before purchasing a product or service; and\n- - ensuring processes are in place for the provision of advice to customers.\n\nThey help us provide the right outcomes for customers, including those with enhanced care needs. This helps us to support customers who are more vulnerable to external impacts, including the current cost of living crisis (see 'Supporting our customers in challenging economic times' on page 15).\n\n## Our approach with our suppliers\n\nWe maintain global standards and procedures for the onboarding and use of third-party suppliers. We require suppliers to meet our third-party risk compliance standards and we assess them to identify any financial stability concerns.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nSupporting and engaging with our supply chain is vital to the development of our sustainable procurement processes. In 2023:\n\n- - We published net zero guides to help buyers and suppliers understand our net zero ambitions. The guides explain our carbon reduction requirements and provide practical advice for meeting these ambitions, as laid out in our supplier code of conduct.\n- - We began developing decarbonisation plans for high-emitting procurement categories, including real estate services, telecommunications, data centres\n\nand servers, and computer hardware. Engagement with suppliers has given us a better understanding of their decarbonisation e/fforts and the challenges and opportunities of achieving net zero in these categories. As a result, strategies for these procurement categories will include decarbonisation plans from 2024 onwards.\n\n- - We completed analysis to understand the impacts and dependencies of our supply chain on biodiversity. The analysis will inform the development of a biodiversity strategy for global procurement in 2024, to reduce supply chain biodiversity impacts.\n- - We launched the supplier diversity portal in the UK and US. The portal enables small and medium-sized enterprises or businesses, which are majority-owned, operated and controlled by historically underrepresented groups, to register interest in becoming an HSBC supplier. For further details, see www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-andresponsibility/working-with-suppliers.\n\n## Financial promotion\n\nOur policies help to ensure that in the sale of products and services, we use marketing and product materials that support customer understanding and fair customer outcomes. This includes providing information on products and services that is clear, fair and not misleading. We also have controls in place to ensure our cross-border marketing complies with relevant regulatory requirements.\n\n## Product governance\n\nOur product management policy covers the entire lifecycle of the product. This helps ensure that our products meet our requirements before we sell them and allows continued risk-based oversight of product performance against the intended customer outcomes.\n\nWhen we decide to withdraw a product from sale, we aim to consider the implications for our existing customers and agree actions to help them achieve a fair outcome where appropriate.\n\n## Supplier code of conduct\n\nOur supplier code of conduct sets out our ambitions, targets and commitments on the environment, diversity and human rights, and outlines the minimum standards we expect of our suppliers on these issues. We seek to formalise adherence to the code with clauses in our supplier contracts, which support the right to audit and act if a breach is discovered. At the end of 2023, 95% of approximately 10,400 contracted suppliers had either confirmed adherence to the supplier code of conduct or provided their own alternative that was accepted by our Global Procurement function.\n\n- For further details of the number of suppliers in each geographical region, see the ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.",

In addition, we have established data privacy governance structures, and continue to embed accountability across all businesses and functions.\n\nWe continue to implement industry practices for data privacy and security. Our privacy teams work closely with our data protection o/fficers, industry bodies and research institutions to drive the design, implementation and monitoring of privacy solutions. We conduct regular reviews and privacy risk assessments, and continue to develop solutions to strengthen our data privacy controls.\n\nWe continue to enhance our internal data privacy tools to improve accountability for data privacy. We have procedures to articulate the actions needed to deal with data privacy considerations. These include notifying regulators, customers or other data subjects, as required under applicable privacy laws and regulations, in the event of a reportable incident occurring.\n\n## Intellectual property rights practices\n\nWe have a group intellectual property risk policy, supported by controls and guidance, to manage risk relating to intellectual property. This is to help ensure that commercially and strategically valuable intellectual property is identified and protected appropriately, including by applying to register trademarks and patents and enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorised use by third parties. Our intellectual property framework also helps us avoid infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, supporting our consistent and e/ffective management of intellectual property risk in line with our risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data Privacy Day\n\nIn January 2023, we held a hybrid roundtable event for our colleagues to mark International Data Privacy Day. The event was hosted by our Global Head of Data Legal, and guest speakers included the former UK Information Commissioner and industry specialists from an external law firm, with HSBC's own data privacy experts in attendance.\n\nThe event covered privacy-related developments likely to have the greatest impact across the Group. Key themes included upcoming data privacy reforms in the UK and the implications for global organisations, and trends in enforcement of data privacy laws and regulations. We also reviewed the impact, successes and challenges of General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') implementation globally.\n\n## The ethical use of data and AI\n\nArtificial intelligence and other emerging technologies provide the opportunity to process and analyse data at a depth and breadth not previously possible. While these technologies o/ffer significant potential benefits for our customers, they also pose potential ethical risks for the financial services industry and society as a whole. We have a set of principles to help ensure we consider and address the ethical issues that could arise. HSBC's Principles for the Ethical Use of Data and Artificial Intelligence are available at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/our-conduct.\n\nWe continue to develop and enhance our approach to, and oversight of, AI, taking into consideration the fast-evolving regulatory landscape, market developments and best practice.",

        "page_content": "## Cybersecurity\n\nThe threat of cyber-attacks remains a concern for our organisation, as it does across the financial sector and other industries. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, failure to protect our operations may result in the loss of sensitive data, disruption for our customers and our business, or financial loss. This could have a negative impact on our customers and our reputation, among other risks.\n\nWe continue to monitor ongoing geopolitical events and changes to the cyber threat landscape and take proactive measures with the aim to reduce any impact to our customers.\n\n## Prevent, detect and mitigate\n\nWe invest in business and technical controls to help prevent, detect and mitigate cyber threats. Our cybersecurity controls follow a 'defence in depth' approach, making use of multiple security layers, recognising the complexity of our environment. Our ability to detect and respond to attacks through round-the-clock security operations centre capabilities is intended to help reduce the impact of attacks.\n\nWe have a cyber intelligence and threat analysis team, which proactively collects and analyses internal and external cyber information to continuously evaluate threat levels for the most prevalent attack types and their potential outcomes. We actively participate in the broader cyber intelligence community, including by sharing technical expertise in investigations, alongside others in the financial services industry and government agencies around the world.\n\nIn 2023, we further strengthened our cyber defences and enhanced our cybersecurity capabilities with the objective to help reduce the likelihood and impact of unauthorised access, security vulnerabilities being exploited, data leakage, third-party security exposure, and advanced malware. These defences build upon a proactive data analytical approach to help identify advanced targeted threats and malicious behaviour.\n\nWe work with our third parties, including suppliers, financial infrastructure bodies and other non-traditional third parties, in an e/ffort to help reduce the threat of cyber-attacks impacting our business services.\n\nWe have a third-party security risk management process in place to assess, identify and manage the risks associated with cybersecurity threats with supplier and other third-party relationships. The process includes risk-based cybersecurity due diligence reviews that assess third parties' cybersecurity programmes against our standards and requirements.\n\n## Policy and governance\n\nWe have a robust suite of cybersecurity policies, procedures and key controls designed to help ensure that the organisation is well managed, with e/ffective oversight and control. This includes but is not limited to defined information security responsibilities for employees, contractors and third parties, as well as standard procedures for cyber incident identification, investigation, mitigation and reporting.\n\nWe operate a three lines of defence model, aligned to the enterprise risk management framework, to help ensure oversight and challenge of our cybersecurity capabilities and priorities. In the first line of defence, we have risk owners within global businesses and functions who are accountable for identifying and managing cyber risk. They work with cybersecurity control owners to apply the appropriate risk treatment in line with our risk appetite. Our controls are designed to be executed in line with our policies and are reviewed and challenged by our risk stewards representing the second line of defence. They are independently assured by the Global Internal Audit function, the third line of defence. The assessment and management of our cybersecurity risk is led and coordinated by a Global Chief Information Security O/fficer, who has extensive experience in financial services, security and resilience, as well as in strategy, governance, risk management and regulatory compliance. The Global Chief Information Security O/fficer is supported by regional and business level chief information security o/fficers. In the event of incidents, the Global Chief Information Security O/fficer and relevant supporting o/fficers are informed by our security operations team and are engaged in alignment with our cybersecurity incident response protocols.\n\nKey performance indicators, control e/ffectiveness and other matters related to cybersecurity, including significant cyber incidents, are presented on a regular basis to various management risk and control committees including to the Board, the Group Risk Management Meeting and across global businesses, functions and regions. This is done to ensure ongoing awareness and management of our cybersecurity position.\n\nOur cybersecurity capabilities are regularly assessed against the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework by independent third parties, and we proactively collaborate with regulators to participate in regular testing activities. HSBC also engages external independent third parties to support our penetration and threat-led penetration testing, which help to identify vulnerabilities to cyber threats and test security resilience.\n\n## Cyber training and awareness\n\nWe understand the important role our people play in protecting against cybersecurity threats. Our aim is to equip every colleague with the appropriate tools and behaviours they need to keep our organisation and customers' data safe. We provide cybersecurity training and awareness to our people, ranging from our top executives to IT developers to front-line relationship managers around the world.\n\nOver 94% of our IT developers hold at least one of our enhanced security certifications to help ensure we build secure systems and products.\n\nWe host an annual Cyber Awareness Month for all colleagues, covering topics such as online safety at home, social media safety, safe hybrid working, and cyber incidents and response. Our dedicated cybersecurity training and awareness team provides a wide range of education and guidance to both customers and our colleagues about how to identify and prevent online fraud.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees completed mandatory cybersecurity training on time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIT developers hold at least one of our internal secure developer certifications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCybersecurity education events were held globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf survey respondents to cybersecurity education events said they have a better understanding of cybersecurity following these events.",

We no longer report 'adjusted' results, which excluded the impact of both foreign currency translation differences and significant items. Instead, we compute constant currency performance by adjusting comparative reported results only for the effects of foreign currency translation differences between the relevant periods. This will enable users to understand the impact of foreign currency translation differences on the Group's performance. We separately disclose 'notable items', which are components of our income statement that management would consider as outside the normal course of business and generally non-recurring in nature. While our primary segmental reporting by global business remains unchanged, effective from 1 January 2023, the Group changed the supplementary presentation of results from geographical regions to main legal entities to better reflect the Group's structure.\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nOn 1 January 2023, HSBC adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'. As required by the standard, the Group applied the requirements retrospectively with comparative data previously published under IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' restated from the 1 January 2022 transition date. As required by IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' a third statement of financial position as at the transition date of 1 January 2022 has been disclosed (for further details, see page 331). Under IFRS 17 there is no present value of in-force business ('PVIF') asset recognised up front. Instead the measurement of the insurance contract liability takes into account fulfilment cash flows and a contractual service margin ('CSM') representing the unearned profit. In contrast to the Group's previous IFRS 4 accounting where profits are recognised up front, under IFRS 17 they are deferred and systematically recognised in revenue as services are provided over the expected coverage period. The CSM also includes directly attributable costs, which had previously been expensed as incurred and which are now incorporated within the insurance liability measurement and recognised over the expected coverage period.\n\nIn conjunction with the implementation of IFRS 17, the Group has made use of the option to re-designate to fair value through profit or loss assets that were previously held at amortised cost totalling $55.1bn, and eligible assets previously held at fair value through other comprehensive income totalling $1.1bn. The re-designation of amortised cost assets generated a net increase to assets of $4.9bn because the fair value measurement on transition was higher than the previous amortised cost carrying amount.\n\nThe impact of the transition was a reduction of $1.1bn on the Group's full-year 2022 reported revenue and a reduction of $0.5bn on full-year 2022 reported profit before tax. The Group's total equity at 1 January 2022 reduced by $10.5bn to $196.3bn on the transition, and tangible equity reduced by $2.4bn to $146.9bn. For further details of our adoption of IFRS 17, see Note 38 'Effects of adoption of IFRS 17' on page 422.\n\n## Cost target\n\nAt our full-year 2022 results, we set a target for our 'adjusted' operating expenses of growth for 2023 compared with 2022. Under our new reporting framework we no longer present 'adjusted' results. The exception to this is for operating expenses, where our 'target basis' will adjust reported results for notable items and the period-onperiod effects of foreign currency translation differences. We also exclude the impact of retranslating comparative period financial information at the latest rates of foreign exchange in hyperinflationary economies, which is not within our control. We consider that this measure provides useful information to investors by quantifying and excluding the items that management considered when setting and assessing cost-related targets. In our target basis, we also exclude the costs related to the acquisition of SVB UK and related investments internationally, which are expected to add approximately 1% to our cost growth compared with 2022.\n\nOur 2022 baseline for operating expenses on this basis is $29.8bn, which has been retranslated at the average rates of foreign exchange for 2023.\n\n## Resegmentation\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, following an internal review to assess which global businesses were best suited to serve our customers' respective needs, a portfolio of our Global Banking customers within our entities in Latin America was transferred from GBM to CMB for reporting purposes. Comparative data have been re-presented accordingly. Similar smaller transfers from GBM to CMB were also undertaken within our entities in Australia and Indonesia, where comparative data have not been re-presented.\n\n## Banking NII\n\nAt our interim 2023 results, we introduced banking net interest income. This alternative performance measure is reconciled on page 104, and deducts from Group reported net interest income: the impact of the cost of funding reported in net interest income used to fund trading and fair value net assets; the impact of foreign exchange swaps in Markets Treasury, where an offsetting income or loss is recorded in trading and fair value income, and third-party net interest income from our insurance business.\n\nThis resulting measure is intended to approximate the Group's banking revenue that is directly impacted by changes in interest rates.\n\n## Use of alternative performance measures\n\nOur reported results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IFRS Accounting Standards'), as detailed in the financial statements starting on page 329.\n\nTo measure our performance, we supplement our IFRS Accounting Standards figures with non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures, which constitute alternative performance measures under European Securities and Markets Authority guidance and non-GAAP financial measures defined in and presented in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These measures include those derived from our reported results that eliminate factors that distort year-on-year comparisons. The 'constant currency performance' measure used throughout this report is described below. Definitions and calculations of other alternative performance measures are included in our 'Reconciliation of alternative performance measures' on page 130. In addition, insurance-specific non-GAAP measures including 'Insurance manufacturing value of new business', 'Insurance manufacturing proxy embedded value', and 'Insurance equity plus CSM net of tax' are provided on pages 116 to 117, together with their definitions and reconciliation to GAAP measures. All alternative performance measures are reconciled to the closest reported performance measure.",

        "page_content": "The global business segmental results are presented on a constant currency basis in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' as detailed in Note 10 'Segmental analysis' on page 372.\n\n## Constant currency performance\n\nConstant currency performance is computed by adjusting reported results for the effects of foreign currency translation differences, which distort year-on-year comparisons.\n\nWe consider constant currency performance to provide useful information for investors by aligning internal and external reporting, and reflecting how management assesses year-on-year performance.\n\n## Notable items\n\nWe separately disclose 'notable items', which are components of our income statement that management would consider as outside the normal course of business and generally non-recurring in nature.\n\nThe tables on pages 112 to 113 and pages 123 to 128 detail the effects of notable items on each of our global business segments, legal entities and selected countries/territories in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Foreign currency translation differences\n\nForeign currency translation differences reflect the movements of the US dollar against most major currencies during 2023.\n\nWe exclude them to derive constant currency data, allowing us to assess balance sheet and income statement performance on a likefor-like basis and to better understand the underlying trends in the business.\n\nForeign currency translation differences for 2023 are computed by retranslating into US dollars for non-US dollar branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates:\n\n- -the income statements for 2022 and 2021 at the average rates of exchange for 2023; and\n- -the balance sheets at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 at the prevailing rates of exchange on 31 December 2023.\n\nNo adjustment has been made to the exchange rates used to translate foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities into the functional currencies of any HSBC branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. The constant currency data of HSBC's Argentina subsidiaries have not been adjusted further for the impacts of hyperinflation. Since 1 June 2022, T\u00fcrkiye has been deemed a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes. HSBC has an operating entity in T\u00fcrkiye and the constant currency data have not been adjusted further for the impacts of hyperinflation.\n\nWhen reference is made to foreign currency translation differences in tables or commentaries, comparative data reported in the functional currencies of HSBC's operations have been translated at the appropriate exchange rates applied in the current period on the basis described above.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe results of HSBC reflect the choice of accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of HSBC's consolidated financial statements. The material accounting policies, including the policies which include critical estimates and judgements, are described in Note 1.2 on the financial statements. The accounting policies listed below are highlighted as they involve a high degree of uncertainty and have a material impact on the financial statements:\n\n- -Impairment of amortised cost financial assets and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI'): The most significant judgements relate to defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk, determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of revolving facilities, selecting and calibrating the probability of default ('PD'), the loss given default ('LGD') and the exposure at default ('EAD') models, as well as selecting model inputs and economic forecasts, making assumptions and estimates to incorporate relevant information about late-breaking and past events, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions, and selecting applicable\n- recovery strategies for certain wholesale credit-impaired loans. A high degree of uncertainty is involved in making estimations using assumptions that are highly subjective and very sensitive to the risk factors. See Note 1.2(i) on page 348.\n- -Deferred tax assets: The most significant judgements relate to those made in respect of recoverability, which are based on expected future profitability. See Note 1.2(l) on page 353.\n- -Valuation of financial instruments: In determining the fair value of financial instruments a variety of valuation techniques are used, some of which feature significant unobservable inputs and are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Note 1.2(c) on page 345.\n- -Impairment of investment in subsidiaries: Impairment testing, including testing for reversal of impairment, involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment, based on a number of management assumptions. See Note 1.2(a) on page 343.\n- -Impairment of interests in associates: Impairment testing, including testing for reversal of impairment, involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment, based on a number of management assumptions. The most significant judgements relate to the impairment testing of our investment in Bank of Communications Co., Limited ('BoCom'). See Note 1.2(a) on page 343.\n- -Impairment of goodwill and non-financial assets: A high degree of uncertainty is involved in estimating the future cash flows of the cash-generating units ('CGUs') and the rates used to discount these cash flows. See Note 1.2(a) on page 343 and Note 1.2(n) on page 353.\n- -Provisions: Significant judgement may be required due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise. See Note 1.2(m) on page 353.\n- -Post-employment benefit plans: The calculation of the defined benefit pension obligation involves the determination of key assumptions including discount rate, inflation rate, pension payments and deferred pensions, pay and mortality. See Note 1.2(k) on page 352.\n- -Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale: Management judgement is required in determining the likelihood of the sale to occur, and the anticipated timing in assessing whether the held for sale criteria have been met. See Note 1.2(o) on page 354.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of the items above, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from the expectations on which management's estimates are based, resulting in the recognition and measurement of materially different amounts from those estimated by management in these financial statements.\n\n## Impact of hyperinflationary accounting\n\nWe continue to treat Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye as hyperinflationary economies for accounting purposes. The impact of applying IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' and the hyperinflation provisions of IAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates' in the current period for our operations in both Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye was a decrease in the Group's profit before tax of $1,297m (2022: $548m), comprising a decrease in revenue, including loss on net monetary position, of $1,586m (2022: $541m) and a decrease in ECL and operating expenses of $289m (2022: increase of $7m). The CPI at 31 December for Argentina was 3,576, with an increase in the year of 2,429.13 (2022: 563.92 increase). The CPI for T\u00fcrkiye was 1,859 with an increase in the year of 730.89 (2022: 359.94 increase).",

This largely offset the $2.1bn recognised in the first quarter of 2023 on the reversal of the held for sale classification at that time. In 2023, a total net $0.1bn of credit was recognised in other operating income, reflecting the net asset value disposed under the final terms of sale. The $0.4bn impairment of goodwill recognised in the third quarter in 2022 has not been reversed.\n- 4 Other operating (expense)/income includes a loss on net monetary positions of $1,667m (2022: $678m; 2021: $576m) as a result of applying IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' and disposal losses on capitalised markets treasury repositioning of $977m in 2023.\n- 5 Net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges also referred to as revenue.\n- 6 Includes dividend paid during the period, which consisted of a second interim dividend of $0.23 per ordinary share in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2022 paid in April 2023 and the first, second and third interim dividends of $0.30 per ordinary share in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2023.\n- 7 In 2023, our dividend payout ratio was adjusted for material notable items and related impacts. In 2022, our dividend payout ratio was adjusted for the loss on classification to held for sale of our retail banking business in France, items relating to the planned sale of our banking business in Canada, and the recognition of certain deferred tax assets. No items were adjusted for in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, all tables in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 are presented on a reported basis.\n\nFor a summary of our financial performance in 2023, see page 27.\n\nFor further financial performance data for each global business and legal entity, see pages 111 to 114 and 120 to 130 respectively.

This reflected higher average interest rates across major currencies compared with 2022.\n\nExcluding the unfavourable impact of foreign currency translation differences, net interest income increased by $6.0bn or 20%.\n\nNII for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.3bn, down 10% compared with the previous quarter, and down 8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was predominantly driven by the impact of higher funding costs across our liabilities, which included the impact of deposit migration in our main legal entities in Asia and Europe. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2023 included an adverse impact of $0.2bn, relating to the first nine months of 2023, due to reclassifications to NII from 'net income from financial instruments\n\nheld for trading or managed on a fair value basis' related to hedges in Canada that will not recur given the expected sale of the business.\n\nThe impact of hyperinflation in Argentina on NII in 2023 was an adverse movement of $0.5bn, with an associated impact on NIM of 2bps. The impact in the fourth quarter of 2023 was an adverse movement of $0.5bn, with an associated impact on NIM of 9bps. This compared with minimal movements in the equivalent periods in 2022. The increase in hyperinflationary accounting impacts in 2023 was notably due to the impact of the devaluation of the Argentinian peso.\n\nNet interest margin ('NIM') for 2023 of 1.66% was 24bps higher compared with 2022, as the rise in the yield on average interestearning assets ('AIEA') of 220bps was partly offset by the rise in the funding costs of average interest-bearing liabilities of 196bps.",

        "page_content": "## Financial summary\n\nThe increase in NIM in 2023 included the unfavourable impact of foreign currency translation differences. Excluding this, NIM increased by 27bps.\n\nNIM for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 1.52%, down 18bps compared with the previous quarter, and down 16bps compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decreases were predominantly driven by a rise in funding costs of average interest-bearing liabilities, which included the impact of customer deposit migration in our main legal entities in Asia and Europe, as well as the Argentina hyperinflation impact as noted above, partly offset by an increase in the yield on AIEA.\n\nInterest income for 2023 of $100.9bn increased by $48.0bn compared with 2022. Interest income of $26.7bn in the fourth quarter of 2023 was down $0.5bn compared with the previous quarter, and up $7.8bn compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The respective increases of $48.0bn and $7.8bn were predominantly driven by the impact of higher market interest rates. The decrease of $0.5bn compared with the previous quarter was predominantly due to hyperinflation in Argentina.\n\nThe change in interest income in 2023 compared with 2022 included an adverse impact of foreign currency translation differences of $1.2bn. After excluding foreign currency translation differences, interest income increased by $49.2bn.\n\nInterest expense for 2023 of $65.1bn increased by $42.6bn compared with 2022. This reflected an increase in funding costs of 223bps, mainly due to the impact of higher interest rates on our liabilities including customer deposit migration, notably in Asia and Europe. Within interest expense was the effect of higher funding costs associated with supporting our trading and fair value activities, as explained below in banking net interest income.\n\nThe rise in interest expense included the favourable effects of foreign currency translation differences of $0.6bn. Excluding this, interest expense increased by $43.2bn.\n\nInterest expense of $18.4bn in the fourth quarter of 2023 was up $0.5bn compared with the third quarter of 2023, and up $8.5bn compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was predominantly driven by the impact of higher market interest rates, and the impact of deposit migration.\n\n## Banking net interest income\n\n|                                                                                                                                        | Year ended      | Year ended      | Quarter ended   | Quarter ended   | Quarter ended   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                                                                                        | 31 Dec 2023 $bn | 31 Dec 2022 $bn | 31 Dec 2023 $bn | 30 Sep 2023 $bn | 31 Dec 2022 $bn |\n| Net interest income                                                                                                                    | 35.8            | 30.4            | 8.3             | 9.2             | 9.0             |\n| Banking book funding costs used to generate 'net income from financial instruments  held for trading or managed on a fair value basis' | 8.7             | 2.5             | 2.5             | 2.4             | 1.3             |\n| Third-party net interest income from insurance                                                                                         | (0.4)           | (0.4)           | (0.1)           | (0.1)           | (0.1)           |\n| Banking net interest income                                                                                                            | 44.1            | 32.5            | 10.7            | 11.5            | 10.2            |\n\nBanking net interest income is an alternative performance measure, and is defined as Group reported net interest income after deducting:\n\n- -the internal cost to fund trading and fair value net assets for which associated revenue is reported in 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis', also referred to as 'trading and fair value income'. These funding costs reflect proxy overnight or term interest rates as applied by internal funds transfer pricing;\n- -the funding costs of foreign exchange swaps in Markets Treasury, where an offsetting income or loss is recorded in trading and fair value income. These instruments are used to manage foreign currency deployment and funding in our entities; and\n- -third-party net interest income in our insurance business.\n\nIn our segmental disclosures, the funding costs of trading and fair value net assets are predominantly recorded in GBM in 'net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis'. On consolidation, this funding is eliminated in Corporate Centre, resulting in an increase in the funding costs reported in net interest income with an equivalent offsetting increase in 'net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis' in this segment. In the second quarter of 2023 we implemented a consistent reporting approach across our most material entities that contribute to our trading and fair value net assets, which resulted in an increase to the first half of 2023 associated funding costs reported through the intersegment elimination in Corporate Centre of approximately $0.4bn, recognised in the second quarter of 2023. In the consolidated Group results, the cost to fund these trading and fair value net assets is reported in net interest income.\n\nThe internally allocated funding cost of $8.7bn, which was incurred in 2023 to generate trading and fair value income, related to trading, fair value and associated net asset balances predominantly in GBM. At 31 December 2023, these stood at approximately $164bn.\n\nNet fee income of $11.8bn was $0.1bn higher than in 2022, and included an adverse impact from foreign currency translation differences of $0.1bn. The rise in net fee income in CMB and WPB was partly offset by a reduction in GBM.\n\nIn CMB, net fee income increased by $0.2bn driven by higher fees from credit facilities, notably in Europe and the UK due to an increase in trade products. Fee income also grew in account services, reflecting greater client activity in transaction banking, mainly in Global Payments Solutions ('GPS'), and in cards, as spending increased compared with 2022. These increases were partly offset by a reduction in fees from funds under management and broking activities.\n\nIn WPB, net fee income increased by $0.1bn. The rise was mainly due to higher cards income, mainly in our legal entities in Hong Kong and in Mexico, as customer spending increased. However, income from broking fell, notably in Hong Kong, due to weaker equity markets and muted customer sentiment. The rise in cards activity resulted in higher fee expenses.\n\nIn GBM, net fee income decreased by $0.2bn. This was driven by higher fee expense, notably in our main entities in Hong Kong, mainly relating to GBM products sold to customers in other global businesses. In Europe, fee expense grew in our private credit business, and we incurred higher interbank and clearing fee expense. There was a decrease in corporate finance fee income, reflecting lower client activity in Europe, and a fall in broking income due to lower equity turnover. Global custody income also fell. This was partly offset by an increase in underwriting income, from an increase in syndicated fees in Europe and a rise in fees in the US following historical lows in 2022.\n\nNet income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis of $16.7bn was $6.4bn higher compared with 2022. This reflected a rise in income, primarily relating to trading activities in GBM, for which the associated funding costs are reported in net interest income, notably in our main legal entities in Hong Kong and Europe. The rise also included a favourable movement on non-qualifying hedges of $0.5bn due to the nonrecurrence of fair value losses in 2022. These increases were partly offset by an adverse fair value movement on foreign exchange hedges related to the planned sale of our banking business in Canada.\n\nNet income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss of $7.9bn compared with a net expense of $13.8bn in 2022. This increase reflected favourable movements on debt",

        "page_content": "securities, due to movements in interest rates, and equities. The increases were notably in our portfolios in Hong Kong and France.\n\nThis favourable movement resulted in a corresponding movement in insurance finance expense, which has an offsetting impact for the related liabilities to policyholders.\n\nInsurance finance expense of $7.8bn compared with an income of $13.8bn in 2022, reflecting the impact of investment returns on underlying assets on the value of liabilities to policyholders, which moves inversely with 'net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nInsurance service result of $1.1bn increased by $0.3bn compared with 2022, primarily due to an increase in the release of the contractual service margin ('CSM'). This primarily reflected a higher CSM balance from higher new business written and favourable assumption updates, primarily from updates to lapse rate assumptions. The increase also reflected a reduction in losses from onerous contracts. Under IFRS 17, the measurement of the insurance contract liability takes into account fulfilment cash flows and a CSM representing the unearned profit. In contrast to the Group's previous IFRS 4 accounting where profits are recognised up front, under IFRS 17 they are deferred and systematically recognised in revenue as services are provided over the life of the contract. The CSM also includes attributable cost, which had previously been expensed as incurred and which is now incorporated within the insurance liability measurement and recognised over the life of the contract.\n\nGain on acquisition of $1.6bn related to the provisional gain recognised in respect of the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited.\n\nImpairment loss relating to the sale of the retail banking operations in France was a net impairment reversal of $0.2bn in 2023, compared with an impairment of $2.3bn in 2022.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations', the disposal group was classified as held for sale on 30 September 2022, at which point the Group recognised the estimated impairment of $2.3bn, which included impairment of\n\ngoodwill of $0.4bn and related transaction costs. In the first quarter of 2023, $2.1bn of this impairment loss was reversed as the sale became less certain. It was reinstated in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we reclassified these operations as held for sale and remeasured the disposal group at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a $2.0bn impairment loss, reflecting the final terms of the sale. The sale completed on 1 January 2024.\n\nOther operating expense of $1.1bn was $0.9bn higher than in 2022. The increase primarily related to losses in 2023 in Markets Treasury on asset disposals of $1.0bn relating to repositioning and risk management activities in our hold-to-collect-and-sell portfolio in certain key legal entities. These actions are accretive to net interest income and reduce the consumption of the Group's financial resources.\n\nThe increased expense also included a loss of $0.3bn in 2023 relating to corrections to historical valuation estimates in our life insurance business, and losses related to the disposal of our New Zealand retail mortgage loan portfolio and the merger of HSBC Bank Oman in 2023 with Sohar International. These were partly offset by losses in 2022 relating to the disposal of our branch operations in Greece and the planned disposal of our business in Russia.\n\nChange in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges ('ECL') were a charge of $3.4bn, a decrease of $0.1bn or 4% compared with 2022.\n\nThe charge in 2023 primarily comprised stage 3 net charges, notably related to mainland China commercial real estate sector exposures. ECL charges in this sector were $1.0bn in 2023. The charge in 2023 also reflected the impact of continued economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. The charge in 2022 of $3.6bn included charges related to mainland China commercial real estate exposures of $1.3bn.\n\nFor further details on the calculation of ECL, including the measurement uncertainties and significant judgements applied to such calculations, the impact of the economic scenarios and management judgemental adjustments, see pages 156 to 168.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n|                                            | Year ended   | Year ended   | Year ended   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                            | 2023 $m      | 2022\u00b9 $m     | 2021 $m      |\n| Gross employee compensation and benefits   | 19,623       | 19,288       | 19,612       |\n| Capitalised wages and salaries             | (1,403)      | (1,285)      | (870)        |\n| Goodwill impairment                        | -            | -            | 587          |\n| Property and equipment                     | 4,285        | 4,949        | 5,145        |\n| Amortisation and impairment of intangibles | 1,827        | 1,701        | 1,438        |\n| UK bank levy                               | 339          | 13           | 116          |\n| Legal proceedings and regulatory matters   | 188          | 246          | 106          |\n| Other operating expenses 2                 | 7,211        | 7,789        | 8,486        |\n| Reported operating expenses                | 32,070       | 32,701       | 34,620       |\n| Currency translation                       | -            | (399)        | (2,376)      |\n| Constant currency operating expenses       | 32,070       | 32,302       | 32,244       |\n\n## Staff numbers (full-time equivalents) 1\n\n|                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Global businesses           |         |         |         |\n| Wealth and Personal Banking | 128,399 | 128,764 | 130,185 |\n| Commercial Banking          | 45,884  | 43,640  | 42,969  |\n| Global Banking and Markets  | 46,241  | 46,435  | 46,166  |\n| Corporate Centre            | 337     | 360     | 377     |\n| At 31 Dec                   | 220,861 | 219,199 | 219,697 |",

        "page_content": "Operating expenses of $32.1bn were $0.6bn or 2% lower than in 2022, including a favourable impact of $0.4bn from foreign currency translation differences.\n\nThis was driven by lower restructuring and other related costs following the completion of our cost to achieve programme, which concluded at the end of 2022, as well as a $0.2bn reduction due to a reversal of historical asset impairments, and the effects of our continued cost discipline. There was also a favourable impact of $0.2bn due to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina in 2023.\n\nThese reductions were partly offset by an increase in technology costs, the impacts of inflation, a higher performance-related pay accrual and severance payments. In addition, the UK bank levy increased by $0.3bn, which included adjustments related to prior years, and we incurred a $0.2bn charge in the US relating to the FDIC special assessment.\n\nThe number of employees expressed in full-time equivalent staff ('FTE') at 31 December 2023 was 220,861, an increase of 1,662 compared with 31 December 2022. The number of contractors at 31 December 2023 was 4,676, a decrease of 1,371.\n\nShare of profit in associates and joint ventures of $2.8bn was $0.1bn or 3% higher than in 2022, reflecting an increase in the share of profit from Saudi Awwal Bank ('SAB').\n\nImpairment of interest in associate of $3.0bn related to our investment in BoCom.\n\nWe maintain a 19.03% interest in BoCom. Since our investment in 2004, BoCom has grown its business significantly to the extent that it has recently been designated as a global systemically important bank ('GSIB').\n\nFor accounting purposes, the balance sheet carrying value attributed to BoCom represents our share of its net assets. We perform quarterly impairment tests incorporating a value-in-use calculation, recognising the gap between this carrying value and the fair value (based on the list share price). We have previously disclosed that the excess of the value-in-use calculation over its carrying value has been marginal in recent years, and that reasonably possible changes in assumptions could generate an impairment.\n\nRecent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors resulted in a wider range of reasonably possible value-in-use outcomes for our BoCom valuation. At 31 December 2023, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying value which resulted in an impairment of $3.0bn, as the recoverable amount as determined by a value-in-use calculation was lower than the carrying value. Our value-in-use calculation uses both historical experience and market participant views to estimate future cash flows, relevant discount rates and associated capital assumptions.\n\nThis impairment will have no material impact on HSBC's capital, capital ratios or distribution capacity, and therefore no impact on dividends or share buy-backs. The insignificant impact on HSBC's capital and CET1 ratio is due to the compensating release of regulatory capital deductions to offset the impairment charge.\n\nWe remain strategically committed to mainland China as demonstrated by our recent announcements to acquire Citi's retail wealth management portfolio and the investments made into mainland China in recent years. BoCom remains a strong partner in China, and we remain focused on maximising the mutual value of our partnership. Our positive views on the medium- and long-term structural growth opportunities in mainland China are unchanged.\n\nFor further details, see Note 18: Interests in associates and joint ventures on page 391.\n\n## Tax expense\n\n|                                       | Year ended 2023 2022   | Year ended 2023 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                       | $m                     | $m                     |\n| Tax (charge)/credit                   |                        |                        |\n| Reported                              | (5,789)                | (809)                  |\n| Currency translation                  | -                      | 160                    |\n| Constant currency tax (charge)/credit | (5,789)                | (649)                  |\n\n## Notable items\n\n|                                      | Year ended 2023 2022   | Year ended 2023 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                      | $m                     | $m                     |\n| Tax                                  |                        |                        |\n| Tax (charge)/credit on notable items | 207                    | 1,026                  |\n| Recognition of losses                | -                      | 2,333                  |\n| Uncertain tax positions              | 427                    | (142)                  |\n\n## Tax expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2023 of 19.1% was higher than the 4.7% in 2022. The effective tax rate for 2023 was increased by 2.3 percentage points by the non-deductible impairment of investments in associates, and reduced by 1.6 percentage points by the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions and reduced by 1.5 percentage points by the non-taxable accounting gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. The effective tax rate for 2022 was reduced by 12.8 percentage points by the recognition of a deferred tax asset on historical tax losses of HSBC Holdings as a result of improved profit forecasts for the UK tax group. Excluding these items, the effective tax rates were 19.9% for 2023 and 17.5% for 2022.\n\n## Return on average tangible equity\n\nIn 2023, RoTE was 14.6%, compared with 10.0% in 2022. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions and the impairment of BoCom, RoTE was 15.6%.\n\n## Supplementary table for planned disposals\n\nThe income statements and selected balance sheet metrics for the year ended 31 December 2023 of our banking business in Canada and our retail banking operations in France are shown below.\n\nThe asset and liability balances relating to these planned disposals are reported on the Group balance sheet within 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities of disposal groups held for sale', respectively, as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIncome statement and selected balance sheet metrics of disposal groups held for sale\n\n|                                       | Year ended 2023   | Year ended 2023      |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n|                                       | Canada 1 $bn      | France  retail 2 $bn |\n| Revenue                               | 2.0               | 0.3                  |\n| ECL                                   | -                 | -                    |\n| Operating expenses                    | (1.0)             | (0.6)                |\n| of which: costs expected to be exited | (0.7)             | (0.4)                |\n| Profit before tax                     | 0.9               | (0.2)                |\n| Loans and advances to customers       | 56.1              | 16.9                 |\n| Customer accounts                     | 63.0              | 22.3                 |\n| RWA 3                                 | 31.9              | 4.1                  |",

December 2022\n\nAt 31 December 2023, total assets of $3.0tn were $89bn or 3% higher on a reported basis and increased by $31bn or 1% on a constant currency basis.\n\nReported loans and advances to customers as a percentage of customer accounts was 58.2% compared with 58.8% at 31 December 2022. The movement in this ratio reflected a higher growth in customer accounts than in lending.\n\n## Assets\n\nCash and balances at central banks decreased by $41bn or 13%, which included a $13bn favourable impact of foreign currency translation differences. The decrease was mainly in HSBC UK, reflecting a reduction in customer accounts and repurchase agreements, as well as an increase in the deployment of our cash surplus into financial investments. Cash fell in HSBC Bank plc as our European branches managed liquidity requirements and due to the completion of the sale of our retail banking operations in France. Cash also decreased in the UK as we deployed our commercial surplus into reverse repurchase agreements and financial investments.\n\nTrading assets increased by $71bn or 33%, mainly as we captured increased client activity in equity and debt securities, particularly in Hong Kong and HSBC Bank plc. The increase in trading assets also reflected the use of surplus liquidity to fund trading activities given the subdued demand for customer lending.\n\nDerivative assets decreased by $54bn or 19%, mainly in Europe, reflecting adverse revaluation movements on interest rate contracts due to a stabilisation and downward shift in long-term yield curve rates in most major markets. Foreign exchange contracts also fell, primarily in HSBC Bank plc, as a result of reduced volatility in foreign exchange rate movements in 2023. The decrease in derivative assets was consistent with the decrease in derivative liabilities, as the underlying risk is broadly matched.",

        "page_content": "Loans and advances to customers of $939bn increased by $15bn or 2% on a reported basis. This included a favourable impact of foreign currency translation differences of $18bn.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, loans and advances to customers fell by $3bn, reflecting the following movements.\n\nIn WPB, customer lending increased by $21bn, reflecting growth in mortgage balances, notably in our main legal entities in Hong Kong (up $6bn), the UK (up $5bn), Mexico (up $1bn) and Australia (up $1bn). There was an increase of $7.8bn in secured lending in our main entity in Europe following the reclassification of a portfolio of home loans previously classified as assets held for sale, relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France. The increase also included growth of $3bn in credit card balances, mainly in our entities in Hong Kong, the UK and Mexico. These increases were partly offset by reductions due to business divestments in Oman and New Zealand.\n\nIn GBM, lending fell by $16bn due to a reduction in term lending, primarily in our main legal entities in Hong Kong, including a reduction in the commercial real estate sector, and in Europe, reflecting muted client demand. Lending also fell by $1bn due to the merger of our operations in Oman with Sohar International. In addition there was a transfer of GBM customers to CMB in Australia and Indonesia, resulting in a $3bn reduction.\n\nIn CMB, customer lending was $7bn lower, mainly in our main legal entities in Hong Kong, including in the commercial real estate sector, and in the US, as well as in HSBC Bank plc, reflecting weaker client demand in a higher interest rate environment. Lending also fell by $1bn due to the sale of our business in Oman. In HSBC UK, lending grew by $4bn, as an increase from the acquisition of SVB UK of $8bn partly mitigated reductions from clients repaying their facilities. The transfer of customers to CMB from GBM in Australia and Indonesia, referred to above, led to an increase of $3bn.\n\nFinancial investments increased by $78bn or 21%, mainly in Asia and Europe from the purchase of debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills, as we redeployed our commercial surplus to benefit from higher yield curves and enhance our hedging activities on net interest income. The increase was across both debt instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income and instruments held at amortised cost.\n\nAssets held for sale of $114bn primarily comprised the assets relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and the planned sale of our banking business in Canada. This balance was broadly stable compared with 2022, as a decrease of $8bn relating to the transfer to loans and advances to customers of a portfolio of secured home loans in France was largely offset by a transfer of cash into assets held for sale, related to the completion of the sale of our retail banking operations there.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nCustomer accounts of $1.6tn increased by $41bn or 3% on a reported basis. This included a favourable impact of foreign currency translation differences of $28bn.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, customer accounts increased by $13bn, reflecting the following movements.\n\nIn WPB, customer accounts grew by $12bn, reflecting higher interestbearing term and money market deposit balances, as interest rates rose, primarily in our main legal entity in Asia, notably Hong Kong (up $10bn, or 3%), Singapore (up $5bn, or 15%), Australia (up $3bn, or 19%), mainland China (up $3bn, or 19%) and Taiwan up ($2bn, or 34%). However, customer accounts fell by $14bn in HSBC UK, reflecting cost of living and competitive pressures. There was also a reduction due to the sale of our business in Oman.\n\nIn CMB, customer accounts increased by $3bn. The growth included an increase of $6bn related to our acquisition of SVB UK, as well as increases in our entities in Asia, excluding Hong Kong, and in continental Europe, mainly in term and money market deposits. In addition, a transfer of customers from GBM to CMB in Australia and Indonesia resulted in a rise of $4bn. These increases mitigated\n\nreductions in our main entities in Hong Kong and the UK and a reduction of $2bn due to the sale of our business in Oman.\n\nIn GBM, customer accounts were marginally lower, falling $2bn. Balances fell in Hong Kong and the UK, although there was growth in continental Europe and Singapore. Balances fell by $1bn following the sale of our business in Oman, and by $4bn due to the transfer of customers from GBM to CMB in Australia and Indonesia.\n\nRepurchase agreements - non-trading increased by $44bn or 35%, notably in HSBC Bank plc, reflecting higher client demand, and in our main entity in Asia due to a higher requirement for short-term funding.\n\nDerivative liabilities decreased by $51bn or 18%, which is consistent with the reduction in derivative assets, since the underlying risk is broadly matched.\n\nDebt securities in issue increased by $16bn or 20%, due to a net increase in debt issuances.\n\nLiabilities of disposal groups held for sale of $108bn primarily comprised the liabilities relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and the planned sale of our banking business in Canada.\n\n## Equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity, including non-controlling interests, increased by $7bn or 4% compared with 31 December 2022.\n\nShareholders' equity was increased by profits generated of $25bn and net gains through other comprehensive income ('OCI') of $5bn. These increases were partly offset by the impact of dividends paid of $12bn, the redemption of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities of $4bn and the impact of our $7bn share buy-back activities in 2023.\n\nThe net gains through OCI of $5bn included favourable movements of $3bn on financial instruments designated as hold-to-collect-and-sell, which are held as hedges to our exposure to interest rate movements. The favourable movement was a result of the fall in longterm market yield curves in 2023. The net gain also included a favourable movement on cash flow hedges of $3bn and from the effects of hyperinflation of $2bn. These gains were partly offset by fair value losses on liabilities related to changes in own credit risk of $1bn, as well as other smaller losses.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nAs part of our interest rate hedging strategy, we hold a portfolio of debt instruments, reported within financial investments, which are classified as hold-to-collect-and-sell. As a result, the change in value of these instruments is recognised through 'debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income' in equity.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, we recognised a pre-tax cumulative unrealised loss reserve through other comprehensive income of $3.9bn related to these hold-to-collect-and-sell positions. This reflected a $2.6bn pretax gain in 2023, inclusive of movements on related fair value hedges. The gain in 2023 included a reduction in unrealised losses due to the disposal of securities as part of repositioning actions taken in this portfolio of $1.0bn. Overall, the Group is positively exposed to rising interest rates through net interest income, although there is an adverse impact on our capital base in the early stages of a rising interest rate environment due to the fair value of hold-to collect-andsell instruments.\n\nOver time, these adverse movements will unwind as the instruments reach maturity, although not all will necessarily be held to maturity.\n\nWe also hold a portfolio of financial investments measured at amortised cost, which are classified as hold-to-collect. At 31 December 2023, there was a cumulative unrealised loss of $1.7bn, although the unrealised loss is not reflected on our balance sheet. This included $1.0bn that related to debt instruments held to manage our interest rate exposure, representing a $0.8bn improvement during 2023.",

Our global businesses - Wealth and Personal Banking, Commercial Banking, and Global Banking and Markets - along with Corporate Centre are our reportable segments under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and are presented below and in Note 10: Segmental analysis on page 372.\n\nOn 1 January 2023, we updated our financial reporting framework and changed the supplementary presentation of results from geographical regions to main legal entities to better reflect the Group's structure.\n\nThe results of main legal entities are presented on a reported and constant currency basis, including HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., HSBC Bank Canada and Grupo Financiero HSBC, S.A. de C.V.\n\nThe results of legal entities are presented on a reported basis on page 120 and a constant currency basis on page 123.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, supported by the rest of the GEC, is considered the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') for the purposes of identifying the Group's reportable segments. Global business results are assessed by the CODM on the basis of constant currency performance. We separately disclose 'notable items', which are components of our income statement that management would consider as outside the normal course of business and generally non-recurring in nature. Constant currency performance information for 2022 and 2021 are presented as described on page 101. As required by IFRS 8, reconciliations of the total constant currency global business results to the Group's reported results are presented on page 373.\n\nSupplementary reconciliations from reported to constant currency results by global business are presented on pages 111 to 113 for information purposes.\n\nGlobal business performance is also assessed using return on tangible equity ('RoTE'). A reconciliation of global business RoTE to the Group's RoTE is provided on page 132.\n\nOur operations are closely integrated and, accordingly, the presentation of data includes internal allocations of certain items of income and expense. These allocations include the costs of certain support services and global functions to the extent that they can be meaningfully attributed to global businesses and legal entities. While such allocations have been made on a systematic and consistent basis, they necessarily involve a degree of subjectivity. Costs that are not allocated to global businesses are included in Corporate Centre.\n\nWhere relevant, income and expense amounts presented include the results of inter-segment funding along with inter-company and interbusiness line transactions. All such transactions are undertaken on arm's length terms. The intra-Group elimination items for the global businesses are presented in Corporate Centre.\n\nHSBC Holdings incurs the liability of the UK bank levy, with the cost being recharged to its UK operating subsidiaries. The current year expense will be reflected in the fourth quarter as it is assessed on our balance sheet position as at 31 December.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, following an internal review to assess which global businesses were best suited to serve our customers' respective needs, a portfolio of our customers within our entities in Latin America was transferred from Global Banking and Markets to Commercial Banking for reporting purposes. Comparative data have been represented accordingly. Similar smaller transfers from Global Banking and Markets to Commercial Banking were also undertaken within our entities in Australia and Indonesia, where comparative data have not been represented.\n\n## Supplementary analysis of constant currency results and notable items by global business\n\nConstant currency results 1\n\n|                                                  | 2023                           | 2023                    | 2023                            | 2023                | 2023      |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n|                                                  | Wealth and Personal Banking $m | Commercial Banking 2 $m | Global Banking and Markets 2 $m | Corporate Centre $m | Total $m  |\n| Revenue 3                                        | 27,275                         | 22,867                  | 16,115                          | (199)               | 66,058    |\n| ECL                                              | (1,058)                        | (2,062)                 | (326)                           | (1)                 | (3,447)   |\n| Operating expenses                               | (14,738)                       | (7,524)                 | (9,865)                         | 57                  | (32,070)  |\n| Share of profit in associates and joint ventures | 65                             | (1)                     | -                               | (257)               | (193)     |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax                         | 11,544                         | 13,280                  | 5,924                           | (400)               | 30,348    |\n| Loans and advances to customers (net)            | 454,878                        | 309,422                 | 173,966                         | 269                 | 938,535   |\n| Customer accounts                                | 804,863                        | 475,666                 | 330,522                         | 596                 | 1,611,647 |",

The impact of foreign currency translation differences on 'All global businesses' profit before tax was a $13m increase for 2022 and a $53m decrease in 2021.\n- 3 The results presented for insurance manufacturing operations are shown before elimination of inter-company transactions with HSBC non-insurance operations. The 'All global businesses' result consists primarily of WPB business, as well as a small proportion of CMB business.\n- 4 Net investment return under IFRS 17 for all global businesses for 2023 was $195m (2022: $183m), which consisted of net interest income, net income/(expenses) on assets held at fair value through profit or loss, and insurance finance income/(expense).\n- 5 Net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, also referred to as revenue.\n- 6 The effect of applying hyperinflation accounting in Argentina on insurance manufacturing operations in all global business resulted in a decrease of $41m in revenue in 2023 (2022: decrease of $7m, 2021: increase of $1m) and a decrease of $41m in profit before tax in 2023 (2022: decrease of $6m, 2021: increase of $1m).\n\n## Insurance manufacturing\n\nThe following commentary, unless otherwise specified, relates to the 'All global businesses' results.\n\nProfit before tax of $0.8bn increased by $0.1bn compared with 2022. This primarily reflected the following:\n\n- -Insurance service result of $1.1bn increased by $0.3bn compared with 2022. This was driven by an increase in the release of CSM of $0.2bn as a result of a higher closing CSM balance from the effect of new business written and favourable assumption updates primarily from updates to lapse rate assumptions. The improved insurance service result also reflected a reduction to losses from onerous contracts of $0.1bn, mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore, in part due to improved market conditions in 2023.\n- -Net investment return (excluding net interest income) increased by $0.1bn, with positive asset returns in 2023 compared with losses in the prior period.\n- -Other operating income reduced by $0.2bn compared with 2022, and included a $0.3bn loss from corrections to historical valuation estimates, partly offset by gains of $0.2bn from reinsurance contracts in Hong Kong.\n\nProfit before tax of $0.6bn in 2022 reduced by $1.5bn compared with 2021, primarily reflecting the change in reporting basis from IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' in 2021 to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' in 2022. Further information regarding the impact of transition is provided in Note 38 'Effects of adoption of IFRS 17' on page 422.\n\nAnnualised new business premiums ('ANP') is used to assess new insurance premiums generated by the business. It is calculated as 100% of annualised first year regular premiums and 10% of single premiums, before reinsurance ceded. ANP in 2023 increased by 61% compared with 2022, primarily from strong new business sales in Hong Kong and a shift in product mix from single to multi-premium products.\n\n## Insurance manufacturing value of new business\n\nInsurance manufacturing value of new business is a non-GAAP alternative performance measure that provides information about value generation from new business sold during the period. Since transitioning to IFRS 17, insurance manufacturing value of new business is a metric used internally to measure the long-term profitability of new business sold, and its disclosure supports the consistent communication of this performance measure, albeit on a",

Insurance manufacturing value of new business is calculated as the sum of the IFRS 17 new business CSM and loss component adjusted for:\n\n- -a full attribution of expenses incurred within our insurance manufacturing operations. IFRS 17 considers only directly attributable expenses within the new business CSM measurement; and\n- -long-term asset spreads expected to be generated over the contract term.

At 31 December 2023, insurance equity plus CSM net of tax was $16,583m (31 December 2022: $14,646m).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, insurance equity plus CSM net of tax was calculated as insurance manufacturing operations equity of $7,731m plus CSM of $10,786m less tax of $1,934m. At 31 December 2022, it was calculated as insurance manufacturing operations equity of $7,236m plus CSM of $9,058m less tax of $1,648m.\n\n## Insurance manufacturing proxy embedded value\n\nInsurance manufacturing proxy embedded value is a non-GAAP alternative performance measure that provides information about the value of the insurance manufacturing operations and is defined as total shareholders' equity plus the present value of projected future profits. It is not comparable with peer embedded value disclosure as there is no single industry standard basis of calculation.\n\nThe present value of projected future profits is calculated as the CSM net of tax adjusted for:\n\n- -a full attribution of expenses incurred within our insurance manufacturing operations, net of tax. IFRS 17 considers only directly attributable expenses within the CSM measurement; and\n- -long-term asset spreads expected to be generated over the contract term, net of tax. Under IFRS 17, CSM is in contrast calculated on a market consistent risk neutral basis.

Assets held in custody are not reported on the Group's balance sheet, except where it is deemed that we are acting as principal rather than agent in our role as investment manager. At 31 December 2023, we held $9.7tn of assets as custodian, an increase of 6% compared with 31 December 2022. The balance comprised $8.8tn of assets in Securities Services, which were recorded at market value, and $0.9tn of assets in Issuer Services, recorded at book value.\n\nThe increase was mainly in Securities Services balances. This was driven by net asset inflows in Europe and Asia, favourable market movements in Asia, North America and Latin America, and a positive impact of currency translation differences in Europe.\n\n## Assets under administration\n\nOur assets under administration business includes the provision of bond and loan administration services, transfer agency services and the valuation of portfolios of securities and other financial assets on behalf of clients and complements the custody business. At 31 December 2023, the value of assets held under administration by the Group amounted to $4.9tn, which was 9% higher than at 31 December 2022. The balance comprised $2.9tn of assets in Securities Services, which were recorded at market value, and $2.0tn of assets in Issuer Services, recorded at book value.\n\nThe increase was mainly driven by Securities Services balances due to net asset inflows in Europe and Asia together with a favourable impact of currency translation differences, market movements and onboarding of new clients in Europe. Issuer Services balances also rose driven by new issuances, notably in the US and the UK, as well as a favourable impact of currency translation differences in the UK.\n\n## Analysis of reported results by legal entities\n\nHSBC reported profit/(loss) before tax and balance sheet data\n\n|                                                                                                                                                   | 2023                  | 2023               | 2023                                                           | 2023                                 | 2023                                    | 2023                  | 2023                                       | 2023                        | 2023                                                                            | 2023                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                   | HSBC  UK Bank  plc $m | HSBC  Bank plc $m  | The  Hongkong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  Limited $m | HSBC  Bank  Middle  East  Limited $m | HSBC  North  America  Holdings  Inc. $m | HSBC  Bank  Canada $m | Grupo  Financiero  HSBC,  S.A. de  C.V. $m | Other  trading  entities $m | Holding  companies,  shared  service  centres and  intra-Group  eliminations $m | Total $m                 |\n| Net interest income                                                                                                                               | 9,684                 | 2,674              | 16,705                                                         | 1,551                                | 1,712                                   | 1,275                 | 2,148                                      | 3,765                       | (3,718)                                                                         | 35,796                   |\n| Net fee income                                                                                                                                    | 1,597                 | 1,527              | 4,859                                                          | 475                                  | 1,237                                   | 559                   | 581                                        | 1,225                       | (215)                                                                           | 11,845                   |\n| Net income from financial  instruments held for trading or  managed on a fair value basis                                                         | 516                   | 4,220              | 9,507                                                          | 397                                  | 729                                     | 110                   | 437                                        | 1,054                       | (309)                                                                           | 16,661                   |\n| Net income from assets and  liabilities of insurance businesses,  including related derivatives,  measured at fair value through profit  and loss | -

These are considered alternative performance measures (non-GAAP financial measures).\n\nThe following information details the adjustments made to the reported results and the calculation of other alternative performance measures. All alternative performance measures are reconciled to the closest reported performance measure.\n\nOn 1 January 2023, HSBC adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'. As required by the standard, the Group applied the requirements retrospectively with comparative data previously published under IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' restated from the 1 January 2022 transition date.\n\nIn addition to the alternative performance measures set out in this section, further alternative performance measures in relation to the Group's insurance manufacturing operations are set out on pages 116 to 117.",

We also exclude the impact of retranslating comparative period financial information at the latest rates of foreign exchange in hyperinflationary economies, which we consider to be outside of our control. Our target basis also excludes the impact of\n\nthe acquisition of SVB UK and related investments internationally, which added approximately 1% to our cost growth in 2023 compared with 2022.

Material notable items are components of our income statement that management would consider as outside the normal course of business and generally non-recurring in nature, which are excluded from our dividend payout ratio calculation and our earnings per share measure, along with related impacts. Categorisation as a material notable item is dependent on the nature of each item in conjunction with the financial impact on the Group's income statement.\n\nRelated impacts include those items that do not qualify for designation as notable items but whose adjustment is considered by management to be appropriate for the purposes of determining the basis for our dividend payout ratio calculation.\n\nIn 2023, material notable items comprised the impacts of the sale of our retail banking operations in France, the planned sale of our\n\nbanking business in Canada, the acquisition of SVB UK and the impairment of BoCom. The impairment of BoCom is included within material notables given that the impairment relates to the accounting assessment of the future value-in-use. The impairment has no material impact on our distribution capacity, dividends or share buybacks. Related items comprised HSBC Bank Canada's financial results from the 30 June 2022 net asset reference date onwards, as a component of the gain on sale will be recognised through the consolidation of HSBC Bank Canada's results in the Group's results, with the remainder recognised at completion.\n\nCommencing in 2024, we will establish a dividend payout ratio on a 'target basis'.

        "page_content": "## Our approach to risk\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe recognise the importance of a strong culture, which refers to our shared attitudes, beliefs, values and standards that shape behaviours including those related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. All our people are responsible for the management of risk, with ultimate supervisory oversight residing with the Board. Our risk appetite defines the level and types of risk that we are willing to take, while informing the financial planning process and guiding strategic decision making.\n\nThe following principles guide the Group's overarching appetite for risk and determine how our businesses and risks are managed.\n\n## Financial position\n\n- -We aim to maintain a strong capital position, defined by regulatory and internal capital ratios.\n- -We carry out liquidity and funding management for each operating entity on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## Operating model\n\n- -We seek to generate returns in line with our risk appetite and strong risk management capability.\n- -We aim to deliver sustainable and diversified earnings and consistent returns for shareholders.\n\n## Business practice\n\n- -We have no appetite for deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers, or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements.\n- -We have no appetite for inappropriate market conduct by any member of staff or by any Group business.\n- -We are committed to managing the climate risks that have an impact on our financial position and delivering on our net zero ambition.\n- -We consider and, where appropriate, mitigate reputational risk that may arise from our business activities and decisions.\n- -We monitor non-financial risk exposure against risk appetite, including exposure related to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or events that impact our customers or can lead to sub-optimal returns to shareholders, censure, or reputational damage.\n\n## Enterprise-wide application\n\nOur risk appetite encapsulates the consideration of financial and nonfinancial risks. We define financial risk as the risk of a financial loss as a result of business activities. We actively take these types of risks to maximise shareholder value and profits. Non-financial risk is the risk to achieving our strategy or objectives as the result of failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.\n\nOur risk appetite is expressed in both quantitative and qualitative terms and applied at the global business and regional levels, and to material operating entities. Every three years, the Group Risk and Compliance function commissions an external independent firm to review the Group's approach to risk appetite and to help ensure that it remains in line with market best practice and regulatory expectations. This review was last carried out in 2021 and confirmed the Group's risk appetite statement ('RAS') remains aligned to best practices, regulatory expectations and strategic goals. Our risk appetite continues to evolve and expand its scope as part of our regular review process.\n\nThe Board reviews and approves the Group's risk appetite regularly to make sure it remains fit for purpose. The Group's risk appetite is considered, developed and enhanced through:\n\n- -an alignment with our strategy, purpose, values and customer needs;\n\n- -trends highlighted in other Group risk reports;\n- -communication with risk stewards on the developing risk landscape;\n- -strength of our capital, liquidity and balance sheet;\n- -compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- -effectiveness of the applicable control environment to mitigate risk, informed by risk ratings from risk control assessments;\n- -functionality, capacity and resilience of available systems to manage risk; and\n- -the level of available staff with the required competencies to manage risks.\n\nWe formally articulate our risk appetite through our RAS. Setting out our risk appetite helps ensure that we agree a suitable level of risk for our strategy. In this way, risk appetite informs our financial planning process and helps senior management to allocate capital to business activities, services and products.\n\nThe RAS is applied to the development of business line strategies, strategic and business planning, and remuneration. At a Group level, performance against the RAS is reported to the Group Risk Management Meeting alongside key risk indicators to support targeted insight and discussion on breaches of risk appetite and any associated mitigating actions. This reporting allows risks to be promptly identified and mitigated, and informs risk-adjusted remuneration to drive a strong risk culture.\n\nEach global business, region and material operating entity is required to have its own RAS, which is monitored to help ensure it remains aligned with the Group's RAS. Each RAS and business activity is guided and underpinned by qualitative principles and/or quantitative metrics.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe recognise that the primary role of risk management is to help protect our customers, business, colleagues, shareholders and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. This is supported through our three lines of defence model described on page 138.\n\nThe implementation of our business strategy remains a key focus. As we implement change initiatives, we actively manage the execution risks. We also perform periodic risk assessments, including against strategies, to help ensure retention of key personnel for our continued safe operation.\n\nWe aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organisation and across all risk types, underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and non-financial. The framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages a sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation process. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. We actively review and enhance our risk management framework and our approach to managing risk, through our activities with regard to: people and capabilities; governance; reporting and management information; credit risk management models; and data.\n\nGroup Risk and Compliance is independent from the global businesses, including our sales and trading functions. It provides challenge, oversight and appropriate balance in risk/return decisions.",

Global Treasury actively manages these risks, supported by the Holdings Asset and Liability Management Committee ('ALCO') and local ALCOs, overseen by Treasury Risk Management and the Group Risk Management Meeting. Further details on treasury risk management are set out on page 203.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nAll our people are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their roles. Roles are defined using the three lines of defence model, which takes into account our business and functional structures as described below.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nTo create a robust control environment to manage risks, we use an activity-based three lines of defence model. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment.\n\nThe model underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibility and encouraging collaboration, as well as enabling effective coordination of risk and control activities. The three lines of defence are summarised below:\n\n- -The first line of defence owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them in line with risk appetite, and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them.\n- -The second line of defence challenges the first line of defence on effective risk management, and provides advice, guidance and assurance of the first line of defence to ensure it is managing risk effectively.\n- -The third line of defence is our Global Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance as to whether our risk management approach and processes are designed and operating effectively.\n\n## Group Risk and Compliance function\n\nOur Group Risk and Compliance function is responsible for the Group's risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing global policy, monitoring risk profiles, and identifying and managing forward-looking risk. Group Risk and Compliance is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. Forming part of the second line of defence, the Group Risk and Compliance function is independent from the global businesses, including sales and trading functions. It provides challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/return decisions.\n\nResponsibility for minimising both financial and non-financial risk, including regulatory compliance and financial crime, lies with our people. They are required to manage the risks of the business and operational activities for which they are responsible. We maintain adequate oversight of our risks through our various specialist risk stewards and the collective accountability held by our chief risk and compliance officers.\n\nWe have continued to strengthen the control environment and our approach to the management of risk, as set out in our risk management framework. Our ongoing focus is on helping to ensure more effective oversight and better end-to-end identification and management of financial and non-financial risks. This is overseen by the Enterprise Risk Management function, headed by the Global Head of Enterprise Risk Management.\n\n## Stress testing and recovery planning\n\nOur stress testing programme assesses our capital and liquidity strength through a rigorous examination of our resilience to external shocks, and forms part of our risk management and capital and liquidity planning. As well as undertaking regulatory-driven stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests in order to understand the nature and level of material risks, quantify the impact of such risks and develop plausible mitigating actions. The outcome of a stress test provides management with key insights into the impact of severely adverse events on the Group and provides an indication of resilience to regulators on the Group's financial stability.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOur internal capital assessment uses a range of stress scenarios that explore risks identified by management. They include potential adverse macroeconomic, geopolitical, climate and operational risk events, as well as other potential events that are specific to HSBC.\n\nThe selection of stress scenarios is based upon the output of our identified top and emerging risks and our risk appetite. Stress testing analysis helps management understand the nature and extent of vulnerabilities to which the Group is exposed. Using this information, management decides whether risks can or should be mitigated through management actions or, if they were to crystallise, be absorbed through capital and liquidity. This in turn informs decisions about preferred capital and liquidity levels and allocations.\n\nDuring 2023, we completed a Group-wide internal stress test alongside testing of the Group's strategy, otherwise known as the corporate plan, to test and inform our strategy and assumptions. The stress scenario explored the potential impact of interest rate shocks and a deep recession. Under this scenario, inflation re-intensifies as accentuated geopolitical tensions lead to severe global supply chain disruptions and a rise in energy prices.\n\nIn addition to the Group-wide stress testing scenarios, each major subsidiary conducts regular macroeconomic and event-driven scenario analysis specific to its region. They also participate, as required, in the regulatory stress testing programmes of the jurisdictions in which they operate, such as stress tests required by the Bank of England",

        "page_content": "('BoE') in the UK, the Federal Reserve Board ('FRB') in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ('HKMA') in Hong Kong. Global functions and businesses also perform bespoke stress testing to inform their assessment of risks to potential scenarios.\n\nWe also conduct reverse stress tests each year at Group level and, where required, at subsidiary entity level to understand potential extreme conditions that would make our business model non-viable. Reverse stress testing identifies potential stresses and vulnerabilities we might face, and helps inform early warning triggers, management actions and contingency plans designed to mitigate risks.\n\n## Recovery and resolution plans\n\nRecovery and resolution plans form part of the integral framework safeguarding the Group's financial stability. The Group recovery plan, together with stress testing, help us understand the likely outcomes of adverse business or economic conditions and in the identification of appropriate risk mitigating actions. The Group is committed to further developing its recovery and resolution capabilities, including in relation to the Resolvability Assessment Framework.\n\n## Ibor transition\n\nInterbank offered rates ('Ibors') were previously used extensively to set interest rates on different types of financial transactions and for valuation purposes, risk measurement and performance benchmarking.\n\nThe publication of sterling, Swiss franc, euro, Japanese yen and US dollar Libor interest rate benchmarks, as well as the Euro Overnight Index Average ('Eonia') and other local interbank interest rates globally, has ceased following regulatory announcements and industry initiatives. To support any remaining contracts referencing sterling and US dollar Libor benchmarks, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') has compelled the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited to publish the three-month sterling Libor setting using an alternative 'synthetic' methodology until 31 March 2024, and the one-month, three-month and six-month US dollar Libor settings until 30 September 2024. We continue to support our customers in the transition of the limited number of outstanding contracts relying on 'synthetic' Libor benchmarks in line with these dates.\n\nThere are approximately 90 of these contracts remaining, which are predominantly syndicated lending contracts, where Commercial Banking and Global Banking customers have required additional time to enable refinancing or restructuring, with transition expected to be completed prior to 30 September 2024. Additionally, there are a small number of Group-issued MREL and capital securities and client retail mortgages that are contingent on demised Ibors after the end of their fixed interest rate periods. HSBC remains committed to seeking to remediate and/or mitigate relevant risks relating to Ibor-demise, as appropriate, for these contracts. HSBC expects to be able to remediate and/or mitigate these risks by the relevant interest rate calculation dates, which may occur post-cessation of the relevant Ibor. All other contracts referencing benchmarks that are no longer published have been transitioned in line with client and investor discussions.\n\nAlthough we continue to track the transition of remaining contracts to alternative interest rate benchmarks, overall, our regulatory compliance, conduct and legal risks have materially diminished. We will continue to monitor until all contracts are fully transitioned.\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nIn 2023, we actively managed the risks related to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as other key risks described in this section. In addition, we sought to enhance our risk management in the following areas:\n\n- -We enhanced our model risk frameworks and controls as we seek to manage the increasing numbers of climate risk, artificial intelligence ('AI') and machine learning models being embedded in business processes. Focus is also on generative AI due to the pace of technological changes and regulatory and wider interest in adoption and usage.\n- -We implemented two revised risk appetite frameworks to better manage and strengthen our controls with respect to concentration risks. These relate to concentration risks arising from exposures to countries and territories, and to single customer groups.\n- -We enhanced our processes, framework and capabilities to seek to improve the control and oversight of our material third parties, and to help maintain our operational resilience and meet new and evolving regulatory requirements.\n- -We continued to make progress with our comprehensive regulatory reporting programme in seeking to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency and enhance controls across regulatory reports.\n- -Through our climate risk programme, we continued to embed climate considerations throughout the organisation, including through risk policy updates and the completion of our annual climate risk materiality assessment. We also developed risk metrics to monitor and manage exposures, and further enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis.\n- -We deployed industry-leading technology and advanced analytics capabilities into new markets to improve our ability to identify suspicious activities and prevent financial crime.\n- -We continued to develop and enhance our electronic communication policies and standards to help ensure that we act on the most substantive issues. A Group-wide approach to providing corporate device access is being implemented to meet regulatory expectations.\n- -We are embedding our suite of regulatory management systems following the Group-wide roll-out of regulatory horizon scanning capabilities, and enhanced regulation mapping tooling.\n- -We continued to stabilise our net interest income, despite the fluctuations in interest rate expectations, driven by central bank rate increases and a reassessment of the trajectory of inflation in major economies.",

        "page_content": "## Top and emerging risks\n\nWe use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-looking view of issues with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to long term.\n\nWe proactively assess the internal and external risk environment, as well as review the themes identified across our regions and global businesses, for any risks that may require global escalation. We update our top and emerging risks as necessary.\n\nOur current top and emerging risks are as follows.\n\n## Externally driven\n\n## Geopolitical and macroeconomic risks\n\nHSBC faces elevated geopolitical risks, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing to have global economic and political implications, and the Israel-Hamas war increasing tensions in the Middle East, leading to recent attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and countermeasures, which have begun to disrupt supply chains. HSBC is monitoring and assessing the impacts of these wars.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has continued to elevate geopolitical instability, which could have continued ramifications for the Group and its customers. HSBC continues to monitor and respond to financial sanctions and trade restrictions that have been adopted in response. These sanctions and trade restrictions are complex, novel and evolving. In particular, the US, the UK and the EU, as well as other countries, have imposed significant sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia. Such sanctions and restrictions target certain Russian government officials, politically exposed persons, business people, Russian oil imports, energy products, financial institutions and other major Russian companies and sanctions evasion networks. These countries have also enacted more generally applicable investment, export, and import bans and restrictions. In December 2023, the US established a new secondary sanctions regime, providing itself broad discretion to impose severe sanctions on non-US banks that are knowingly or even unknowingly engaged in certain transactions or services involving Russia's military-industrial base. This creates challenges associated with the detection or prevention of third-party activities beyond HSBC's control. The imposition of such sanctions against any non-US HSBC entity could result in significant adverse commercial, operational, and reputational consequences for HSBC, including the restriction or termination of the non-US HSBC entity's ability to access the US financial system and the freezing of the entity's assets that are subject to US jurisdiction. In response to such sanctions and trade restrictions, as well as asset flight, Russia has implemented certain countermeasures, including the expropriation of foreign assets.\n\nOur business in Russia principally serves multinational corporate clients headquartered in other countries, is not accepting new business or customers and is consequently on a declining trend. Following a strategic review, HSBC Europe BV (a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Bank plc) has entered into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary HSBC Bank (RR) (Limited Liability Company), subject to regulatory and governmental approvals. The planned sale of our business in Russia became less certain and remains subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe US-China relationship remains complex. To date, the US, the UK, the EU and other countries have imposed various sanctions and trade restrictions on Chinese persons and companies, and the countries' respective approaches to strategic competition with China continue to develop. Although sanctions and trade restrictions are difficult to predict, increases in diplomatic tensions between China and the US and other countries could result in further sanctions and trade restrictions that could negatively impact the Group, its customers and the markets in which the Group operates. For example, there is a continued risk of additional sanctions and trade restrictions being imposed by the US and other governments in relation to human rights, technology, and other issues, and this could create a more complex operating environment for the Group and its customers.\n\nChina, in turn, imposed a number of its own sanctions and trade restrictions that target, or provide authority to target, foreign individuals and companies as well as certain goods such as rare earth minerals and metals, and technology and services. These, as well as certain law enforcement measures, have been imposed against certain countries, Western consulting and data intelligence firms, defence companies and public officials associated with the implementation of foreign sanctions against China.\n\nFurther sanctions, counter-sanctions and trade restrictions may adversely affect the Group, its customers and the markets in which the Group operates, by creating regulatory, reputational and market risks.\n\nEconomic and financial risks also remain significant, and we continue to monitor our risk profile closely in the context of uncertainty over global macroeconomic policies.\n\nA fall in global energy and food prices from the highs of 2022 facilitated a process of disinflation across key economies during 2023. To date, the Israel-Hamas war has not materially disrupted energy supply, and non-OPEC producers, including the US, increased output in the fourth quarter of 2023. Similarly, geopolitical developments in the Middle East have not to date led to a sustained increase in energy prices, but disruption and further price volatility continue to be a risk. The escalation or a broadening of either the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Hamas war could aggravate supply chain disruptions and drive inflation higher and may pose challenges for our customers and our business.\n\nFollowing the reduction in global inflation rates, central banks in most developed markets are expected to have concluded monetary policy tightening in the second half of 2023. A further fall in inflation is expected to enable reductions in interest rates throughout 2024, although forecasts still assume that they remain materially higher than in recent years. Higher financing costs will raise interest payment burdens for many counterparties.\n\nFiscal deficits are also expected to remain large in both developed and emerging markets, as public spending on items including social welfare, defence and climate transition initiatives is expected to remain high. In many countries, the fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic has also left a very high public debt burden. Against a backdrop of slower economic growth and high interest rates, a rise in borrowing costs could increase the financial strains on highly indebted sovereigns.\n\nPolitical changes may also have implications for policy. Many countries are expected to hold elections in 2024. This may result in continuity in some markets, but significant political and policy change in others. Political change could bring uncertainty to the political and legal frameworks in markets where the Group operates.\n\nSector-specific risks are also closely monitored. Mainland China commercial real estate conditions remain distressed as offshore financing conditions and buyer demand remain subdued. Signs of a material or sustained recovery are yet to emerge, with market data still reflecting reduced investment and weak sentiment. The Chinese government is expected to expand fiscal and monetary support to the economy to boost growth and lending in 2024, including specific measures to support developers and stimulate housing demand. However, the risk of a slow and protracted recovery remains significant. The business and financial performance of corporates operating in this market has been weak, and refinancing risks are likely to continue in 2024. State-owned enterprises continue to outperform privately-owned enterprises in general, with above market average sales performance, market share gains and greater access to funding. The challenges in this sector could create further pressure on our customers. We continue to closely monitor and take actions to proactively risk manage our portfolio.\n\nMacroeconomic, financial and geopolitical risks have all impacted our macroeconomic risk scenarios. Our Central scenario, which has the highest probability weighting in our IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' calculations of ECL, assumes that GDP growth rates in our main markets will slow down in 2024, followed by a moderate recovery in",

        "page_content": "2025. It is anticipated that inflation will converge towards central banks' target rates by early 2025. Similarly, interest rates are expected to decline but remain materially higher than in recent years. We also consider scenarios where commodity prices are materially higher, inflation and interest rates rise and a global recession follows, although we assign these scenarios a lower probability of occurring.\n\nForecasts remain uncertain, and changing economic conditions and the materialisation of key risks could reduce the accuracy of the Central scenario forecast. In particular, forecasts in recent years have been sensitive to commodity price changes, changing supply chain conditions, monetary policy adjustments and inflation expectations. Uncertainty remains with respect to the relationship between the economic factors and historical loss experience, which has required adjustments to modelled ECL in cases where we determined that the model was unable to capture the material underlying risks.\n\nDespite these risks, forecast stability and reduced forecast dispersion in our main markets ensured that the Central scenario for impairment was assigned the same likelihood of occurrence across our key markets.\n\nFor further details of our Central and other scenarios, see 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 156.\n\nGlobal tensions over trade, technology and ideology are manifesting themselves in divergent regulatory standards and compliance regimes, presenting long-term strategic challenges for multinational businesses.\n\nAs the geopolitical landscape evolves, compliance by multinational corporations with their legal or regulatory obligations in one jurisdiction may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional compliance, reputational and political risks for the Group. We maintain dialogue with our regulators in various jurisdictions on the impact of legal and regulatory obligations on our business and customers.\n\nThe financial impact on the Group of geopolitical risks in Asia is heightened due to the region's relatively high contribution to the Group's profitability, particularly in Hong Kong.\n\nWhile it is the Group's policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which it operates, geopolitical tensions, and potential ambiguities in the Group's compliance obligations, will continue to present challenges and risks for the Group and could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, strategy and reputation, as well as on the Group's customers.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We closely monitor geopolitical and economic developments in key markets and sectors, and undertake scenario analysis where appropriate. This helps us to take actions to manage our portfolios where necessary, including through enhanced monitoring, amending our risk appetite and/or reducing limits and exposures.\n- -We stress test portfolios of particular concern to identify sensitivity to loss under a range of scenarios, with management actions being taken to rebalance exposures and manage risk appetite where necessary.\n- -We regularly review key portfolios - including our commercial real estate portfolio - to help ensure that individual customer or portfolio risks are understood and that our ability to manage the level of facilities offered through any downturn is appropriate.\n- -We continue to seek to manage sanctions and trade restrictions through the use of reasonably designed policies, procedures and controls, which are subject to ongoing testing, auditing and enhancements.\n- -We have taken steps, where necessary, to enhance physical security in geographical areas deemed to be at high risk from terrorism and military conflicts.\n\n## Technology and cybersecurity risk\n\nLike other organisations, we operate in an extensive and complex technology landscape. We need to remain resilient in order to support customers, our colleagues and financial markets globally. Risks arise where, for example, technology is not understood, maintained or developed appropriately. We also continue to operate in an increasingly complex cyber threat environment globally. These threats include potential unauthorised access to customer accounts and attacks on systems, whether ours or our third-party suppliers'. These threats require ongoing investment in business and technical controls to defend against them.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We continue to upgrade many of our IT systems and are transforming how software solutions are developed, delivered, maintained and tested as part of our investment in the Group's operational resilience capabilities to seek to meet the expectations of our customers and regulators and to help prevent disruptions to our services.\n- -Our cyber intelligence and threat analysis team continually evaluate threat levels for the most prevalent cyber-attack types and their potential outcomes (see page 98), and we continue to seek to strengthen our controls to help reduce the likelihood and impact of advanced malware, data leakage, exposure through third parties and security vulnerabilities.\n- -We continue to seek to enhance our cybersecurity capabilities, including Cloud security, identity and access management, metrics and data analytics, and third-party security reviews and to invest in mitigating the potential threats of emerging technologies.\n- -We regularly report and review cyber risk and control effectiveness at executive level across global businesses, functions and regions, as well as at non-executive Board level to help ensure there is appropriate visibility and governance of the risk and its mitigating actions.\n- -We participate globally in industry bodies and working groups to collaborate on tactics employed by cyber-crime groups and to work together to seek to prevent, detect and defend against cyber-attacks on financial organisations globally.\n- -We respond to attempts to compromise our cybersecurity in accordance with our cybersecurity framework, which adheres to applicable laws, rules and regulations. To date, none of these attacks have had a material impact on our business or operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance ('ESG') risk\n\nWe are subject to financial and non-financial risks associated with ESG-related matters. Our current areas of focus include climate risk, nature-related risks and human rights risks. These can impact us both directly and indirectly through our business activities and relationships. For details of how we govern ESG, see page 88.\n\nOur assessment of climate risks covers three distinct time periods, comprising: short term, which is up to 2025; medium term, which is between 2026 and 2035; and long term, which is between 2036 and 2050. These time periods are aligned to the Climate Action 100+ framework v1.2.\n\nWe may face credit losses if our customers' business models fail to align to a net zero economy or if our customers face disruption to their operations or deterioration to their assets as a result of extreme weather.\n\nWe may face trading losses if climate change results in changes to macroeconomic and financial variables that negatively impact our trading book exposures.\n\nWe may face impacts from physical risk on our own operations and premises, owing to the increase in frequency and severity of weather events and chronic shifts in weather patterns, which could affect our ability to conduct our day-to-day operations.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\nWe may face increased reputational, legal, and regulatory compliance risks if we fail to make sufficient progress towards our net zero ambition, and ESG-related targets, commitments and ambitions, if we fail to meet evolving regulatory expectations and requirements on the management of climate risk and broader ESG risks, or if we knowingly or unknowingly make inaccurate, unclear, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims regarding sustainability to our stakeholders.\n\nRequirements, policy objectives, expectations or views may vary by jurisdiction and stakeholder in relation to ESG-related matters. We may be subject to potentially conflicting approaches to ESG matters in certain jurisdictions, which may impact our ability to conduct certain business within those jurisdictions or result in additional regulatory compliance, reputational, political or litigation risks. These risks may also arise from divergence in the implementation of ESG, climate policy and financial regulation in the many regions in which we operate, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.\n\nWe may face financial reporting risk in relation to our climate-related and broader ESG disclosures, as any data, methodologies, scenarios and reporting standards we have used may evolve over time in line with market practice, regulation or developments in science. We may also face the risk of making reporting errors due to issues relating to the availability, accuracy and verifiability of data, and system, process and control challenges. Any changes and reporting errors could result in revisions to our internal frameworks and reported data and could mean that reported figures are not reconcilable or comparable year on year. We may also have to re-evaluate our progress towards our climate-related targets in the future.\n\nWe may face model risk, as the uncertain and evolving impacts of climate change and data and methodology limitations present challenges to creating reliable and accurate model outputs.\n\nWe may face climate and broader ESG-related litigation and regulatory enforcement risks, either directly if stakeholders think that we are not adequately managing climate and broader ESG-related risks, or indirectly if our clients and customers are themselves the subject of litigation, potentially resulting in the revaluation of client assets.\n\nWe may also be exposed to nature-related risks beyond climate change. These risks arise when the provision of ecosystem services, such as water availability, air quality and soil quality, is compromised by human activity. Nature risk can manifest through macroeconomic, market, credit, reputational, legal and regulatory risks, for both HSBC and our customers.\n\nRegulation and disclosure requirements in relation to human rights, and to modern slavery in particular, are increasing. Businesses are expected to be transparent about their efforts to identify and respond to the risk of negative human rights impacts arising from their business activities and relationships.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -A dedicated Environmental Risk Oversight Forum is responsible for shaping and overseeing our approach and providing support in managing climate and sustainability risk. For further details of the Group's ESG governance structure, see page 88.\n- -Our climate risk programme continues to support the development of our climate risk management capabilities across four key pillars: governance and risk appetite, risk management, stress testing and scenario analysis, and disclosures. We continue to enhance our approach and mitigation of the risk of greenwashing.\n- -In January 2024, we updated our energy policy covering the broader energy system including upstream oil and gas, oil and gas power generation, coal, hydrogen, renewables and hydropower, nuclear, biomass and energy from waste. We also updated our thermal coal phase-out policy, which aims to drive thermal coal phase-out aligned to science-based timeframes. We take a riskbased approach in the way that we identify transactions and clients to which our energy and thermal coal phase-out policies apply, and report on relevant exposures, adopting approaches proportionate to risk and materiality. For further details of our sustainability risk policies, see page 67.\n\n- -In 2023, we conducted pilot exercises to assess nature risk exposures, focusing on our continental Europe portfolios in line with regulatory expectations.\n- -In 2023, we provided practical guidance and training, where relevant, to our colleagues across the Group on how to identify and manage human rights risk. For further details, see page 89.\n- -We have expanded the scope of financial reporting risk to explicitly include oversight over accuracy and completeness of climaterelated and broader ESG disclosures. In 2023, we updated the risk appetite statement to reference our ESG and climate-related disclosures. We also updated our internal controls to incorporate requirements for addressing the risk of misstatement in climaterelated and broader ESG disclosures. To support this, we have developed a framework to guide control implementation over climate-related and broader ESG disclosures, which includes areas such as process and data governance, and risk assessment.\n- -We continue to engage with our customers, investors and regulators proactively on the management of climate-related and broader ESG risks. We also engage with initiatives, including the Climate Financial Risk Forum, Equator Principles, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) to help drive best practice for climate risk management.\n\nFor further details of our approach to climate risk management, see 'Climate risk' on page 221.\n\nFor further details of ESG risk management, see 'Financial crime risk' on page 231 and 'Regulatory compliance risk' on page 231.\n\nOur ESG review can be found on page 42.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nFinancial institutions remain under considerable regulatory scrutiny regarding their ability to detect and prevent financial crime. In 2023, these risks were exacerbated by rising geopolitical tensions and ongoing macroeconomic factors. These challenging developments require managing conflicting laws and approaches to legal and regulatory regimes, and implementing increasingly complex and less predictable sanctions and trade restrictions.\n\nAmid high levels of inflation and increasing cost of living pressures, we face increasing regulatory expectations with respect to managing internal and external fraud and protecting vulnerable customers. In addition, the accessibility and increasing sophistication of generative AI brings financial crime risks. While there is potential for the technology to support financial crime detection, there is also a risk that criminals use generative AI to perpetrate fraud, particularly scams.\n\nThe digitisation of financial services continues to have an impact on the payments ecosystem, with an increasing number of new market entrants and payment mechanisms, not all of which are subject to the\n\nsame level of regulatory scrutiny or regulations as banks. Developments around digital assets and currencies have continued at pace, with an increasing regulatory and enforcement focus on the financial crimes linked to these types of assets.\n\nExpectations continue to increase with respect to the intersection of ESG issues and financial crime, as our organisation, customers and suppliers transition to net zero. These are particularly focused on potential 'greenwashing', human rights issues and environmental crimes. In addition, climate change itself could heighten risks linked to vulnerable migrant populations in countries where financial crime is already more prevalent.\n\nWe also continue to face increasing challenges presented by national data privacy requirements, which may affect our ability to manage financial crime risks across markets.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We continue to seek to manage sanctions and trade restrictions through the use of reasonably designed policies, procedures and controls, which are subject to ongoing testing, auditing and enhancements.\n- -We continue to develop our fraud controls and invest in capabilities to fight financial crime through the application of",

        "page_content": "- advanced analytics and AI, while monitoring technological developments and engaging with third parties.\n- -We are looking at the impact of a rapidly changing payments ecosystem, as well as risks associated with direct and indirect exposure to digital assets and currencies, in an effort to maintain appropriate financial crime controls.\n- -We regularly review our existing policies and control framework so that developments relating to ESG are considered and the financial crime risks are mitigated to the extent possible.\n- -We engage with regulators, policymakers and relevant international bodies, seeking to address data privacy challenges through international standards, guidance and legislation.\n\n## Digitalisation and technological advances risk\n\nDevelopments in technology and changes to regulations are enabling new entrants to the industry, particularly with respect to payments. This challenges us to continue innovating to address evolving customer requirements, drive efficiency and adapt our products to attract and retain customers. As a result, we may need to increase our investment in our business to adapt or develop products and services to respond to our customers' evolving needs. We also need to ensure that new digital capabilities do not weaken our resilience or wider risk management capabilities.\n\nNew technologies such as generative AI, large language models blockchain and quantum computing offer both business opportunities and potential risks for HSBC. As with the use of all technologies, we aim to maximise their potential while seeking to ensure a robust control environment is in place to help manage the inherent risks, such as the impact on encryption algorithms.\n\n## Mitigating actions:\n\n- -We continue to monitor this emerging risk and advances in technology, as well as changes in customer behaviours, to understand how these may impact our business.\n- -We assess new technologies to help develop appropriate controls and maintain resilience.\n- -We closely monitor and assess financial crime risk and the impact on payment transparency and architecture.\n\n## Evolving regulatory environment risk\n\nWe aim to keep abreast of the emerging regulatory compliance and conduct risk agenda. Current focus areas include but are not limited to: ESG agenda developments, including in particular managing the risk of 'greenwashing'; ensuring good customer outcomes, including addressing customer vulnerabilities due to cost of living pressures; enhancements to regulatory reporting controls; and employee compliance, including the use of e-communication channels.\n\nThe competitive landscape in which the Group operates may be impacted by future regulatory changes and government intervention.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We monitor regulatory developments to understand the evolving regulatory landscape, and seek to respond with changes in a timely manner.\n- -We engage with governments and regulators, and respond to consultations with a view to help shape regulations that can be implemented effectively.\n- -We hold regular meetings with relevant authorities to discuss strategic contingency plans, including those arising from geopolitical issues.\n- -Our purpose-led conduct approach aligns to our purpose and values, in particular the value 'we take responsibility'.\n\n## Internally driven\n\n## Data risk\n\nWe use multiple systems and growing quantities of data to support our customers. Risk arises if data is incorrect, unavailable, misused, or unprotected. Along with other banks and financial institutions, we need to meet external regulatory obligations and laws that cover data, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's 239 guidelines and the General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -Through our global data management framework, we monitor the quality, availability and security of data that supports our customers and internal processes. We work towards resolving any identified data issues in a timely manner.\n- -We continue to make improvements to our data policies and to our control framework - which includes trusted sources, data flows and data quality - in order to enhance the end-to-end management of data risk.\n- -We have established a global data management utility and continue to simplify and unify data management activities across the Group.\n- -We seek to protect customer data through our data privacy framework, which establishes practices, design principles and guidelines that enable us to demonstrate compliance with data privacy laws and regulations.\n- -We continue to modernise our data and analytics infrastructure through investments in Cloud technology, data visualisation, machine learning and AI.\n- -We continue to educate our employees on data risk and data management. We have delivered regular mandatory training globally on how to protect and manage data appropriately.\n\n## Risks arising from the receipt of services from third parties\n\nWe use third parties to provide a range of goods and services. It is critical that we ensure we have appropriate risk management policies, processes and practices over the selection, governance and oversight of third parties and their supply chain, particularly for key activities that could affect our operational resilience. Any deficiency in the management of risks associated with our third parties could affect our ability to support our customers and meet regulatory expectations.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We continue to monitor the effectiveness of the controls operated by our third-party providers and request third-party control reports, where required.\n- -We continue to enhance the effective management of our intraGroup arrangements using the same control standards as we have for external third-party arrangements.\n- -We have strengthened the way third-party risk is overseen and managed across all non-financial risks, and have enhanced our processes, framework and reporting capabilities to help improve the visibility of risk and enable more robust management of our material third parties by our global businesses, functions and regions.\n- -We are implementing the changes required by new regulations as set by our regulators.\n\n## Model risk\n\nModel risk arises whenever business decision making includes reliance on models. We use models in both financial and non-financial contexts, as well as in a range of business applications such as customer selection, product pricing, financial crime transaction monitoring, creditworthiness evaluation and financial reporting. Assessing model performance is a continuous undertaking. Models can need redevelopment as market conditions change. Significant increases in global inflation and interest rates have impacted the reliability and accuracy of both credit and market risk models.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\nWe continued to prioritise the redevelopment of internal ratings-based ('IRB') and internal model methods ('IMM') models, in relation to counterparty credit, as part of the IRB repair and Basel III programmes, with a key focus on enhancing the quality of data used as model inputs. Some models have been approved and a number are pending approval decisions from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and other key regulators. Some IMM and internal model approach ('IMA') models have been approved for use, and feedback has been received for some IRB models. Climate risk modelling is a key focus for the Group as HSBC's commitment to ESG has become a key part of the Group's strategy. Focus is also on AI and machine learning where the pace of technological advances is driving significant changes in modelling techniques.\n\nModel risk remains a key area of focus given the regulatory scrutiny in this area, with local regulatory exams taking place in many jurisdictions and the PRA's publication of supervisory statement 1/23 (SS1/23) which provided revised principles on how model risk should be managed, as well as further developments in policy expected from other regulators.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We have continued to embed the enhanced monitoring, review and challenge of expected credit loss model performance through our Model Risk Management function as part of a broader quarterly process to determine loss levels. The Model Risk Management team aims to provide effective review and challenge of any future redevelopment of these models.\n- -A programme of work is in progress to address the requirements of the new PRA guidance for managing model risk.\n- -Model Risk Governance committees at the Group, business and functional levels continue to provide oversight of model risk.\n- -A full review of the Group's model landscape is being undertaken across the organisation to ensure models are being deployed in line with global business strategy.\n- -Model Risk Management works closely with businesses to ensure that IRB/IMM/IMA models in development meet risk management, pricing and capital management needs. Global Internal Audit provides assurance over the risk management framework for models.\n- -Additional assurance work is performed by the model risk governance teams, which act as second lines of defence. The teams test whether controls implemented by model users comply with model risk policy and if model risk standards are adequate.\n- -Models using AI or generative AI techniques are validated and monitored to help ensure that risks that are determined by the algorithms have adequate oversight and review. A framework to manage the range of risks that are generated by these advanced techniques, and to recognise the multidisciplinary nature of these risks, is being developed.\n\n## Change execution risk\n\nThe needs of our customers are evolving faster than ever, particularly with regard to technological advancements and the global transition to a low-carbon economy. The resulting scale, complexity and pace of strategic and regulatory change have elevated the level of risk for executing such changes safely and efficiently.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -Change execution risk is part of our risk taxonomy and control library so that it is defined, assessed, managed, reported and overseen in the same way as our other material risks.\n- -Our change framework provides colleagues across all levels of the Group who deliver on strategic and organisational initiatives with a common and consistent understanding of their role in achieving value and outcomes.\n- -The Change Prioritisation and Oversight Committee oversees the prioritisation, strategic alignment and management of execution risk for all strategic change portfolios and initiatives.\n\n## Risks associated with workforce capability, capacity and environmental factors with potential impact on growth\n\nOur global businesses and functions in all of our markets are exposed to risks associated with workforce capacity challenges, including challenges to retain, develop and attract high-performing employees in key labour markets, and compliance with employment laws and regulations. Failure to manage these risks may have an impact on the delivery of our strategic objectives. It could also result in poor customer outcomes or a breach of employment laws and regulations, which may lead to regulatory sanctions or legal claims.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- -We seek to promote a diverse and inclusive workforce and provide health and well-being support. We continue to build our speak-up culture through active campaigns.\n- -We monitor hiring activities and levels of employee attrition, with each business and function putting in place plans to help ensure they have effective workforce forecasting to meet business demands.\n- -We monitor people risks that could arise due to organisational restructuring, helping to ensure we manage redundancies sensitively and support impacted employees. We encourage our people leaders to focus on talent retention at all levels, with an empathetic mindset and approach, while ensuring the whole proposition of working at HSBC is well understood.\n- -Our Future Skills curriculum helps provides skills that will help to enable employees and HSBC to be successful in the future.\n- -We develop succession plans for key management roles, with oversight from the Group Executive Committee.",

Credit risk arises principally from direct lending, trade finance and leasing business, but also from other products such as guarantees and derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nThere were no material changes to the policies and practices for the management of credit risk in 2023. We continued to apply the requirements of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' within the Credit Risk sub-function. For our wholesale portfolios, we introduced new policies for the management of country risk, subordinated debt assessments, and a revised risk appetite framework. Implementation of these changes did not have a material impact on our wholesale portfolios.\n\nWe actively managed the risks related to macroeconomic uncertainties, including interest rates, inflation, fiscal and monetary policy, broader geopolitical uncertainties and conflicts.\n\nFor further details, see 'Top and emerging risks' on page 140.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nWe have established Group-wide credit risk management and related IFRS 9 processes. We continue to assess the impact of economic developments in key markets on specific customers, customer segments or portfolios. As credit conditions change, we take mitigating actions, including the revision of risk appetites or limits and tenors, as appropriate. In addition, we continue to evaluate the terms under which we provide credit facilities within the context of individual customer requirements, the quality of the relationship, local regulatory requirements, market practices and our local market position.\n\n## Credit Risk sub-function\n\n## (Audited)\n\nCredit approval authorities are delegated by the Board to the Group Chief Executive together with the authority to sub-delegate them. The Credit Risk sub-function in Group Risk and Compliance is responsible for the key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating Group credit policies and risk rating frameworks, guiding the Group's appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking independent reviews and objective assessment of credit risk, and monitoring performance and management of portfolios.\n\nThe principal objectives of our credit risk management are:\n\n- -to maintain across HSBC a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks;\n- -to both partner and challenge our businesses in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and\n- -to ensure there is independent, expert scrutiny of credit risks, their costs and their mitigation.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' process\n\nThe IFRS 9 process comprises three main areas: modelling and data; implementation; and governance.\n\n## Modelling, data and forward economic guidance\n\nWe have established IFRS 9 modelling and data processes in various geographies, which are subject to internal model risk governance including independent review of significant model developments.\n\nWe have a centralised process for generating unbiased and independent global economic scenarios. Scenarios are subject to a process of review and challenge by a dedicated central team and individually for each region. Each quarter, the scenarios and probability weights are reviewed and checked for consistency with the economic conjuncture and current economic and financial risks. These are subject to final review and approval by senior management in a Forward Economic Guidance Global Business Impairment Committee.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA centralised impairment engine performs the expected credit losses calculation using data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Where possible, these checks and processes are performed in a globally consistent and centralised manner.\n\n## Governance\n\nRegional management review forums are established in key sites and regions in order to review and approve the impairment results. Regional management review forums have representatives from Credit Risk and Finance. The key site and regional approvals are reported up to the relevant global business impairment committee for final approval of the Group's ECL for the period. Required members of the committee are the Wholesale Global Chief Corporate Credit Officer and Chief Risk and Compliance Officer for Wealth and Personal Banking Risk, as well as the relevant global business's Chief Financial Officer and the Global Financial Controller.\n\n## Concentration of exposure\n\n## (Audited)\n\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties or exposures have comparable economic characteristics, or such counterparties are engaged in similar activities or operate in the same geographical areas or industry sectors so that their collective ability to meet contractual obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. We use a number of controls and measures to minimise undue concentration of exposure in our portfolios across industries, countries and global businesses. These include portfolio and counterparty limits, approval and review controls, and stress testing.\n\n## Credit quality of financial instruments\n\n## (Audited)\n\nOur risk rating system facilitates the internal ratings-based approach under the Basel framework adopted by the Group to support the calculation of our minimum credit regulatory capital requirement. The five credit quality classifications encompass a range of granular internal credit rating grades assigned to wholesale and retail customers, and the external ratings attributed by external agencies to debt securities.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\nFor debt securities and certain other financial instruments, external ratings have been aligned to the five quality classifications based upon the mapping of related customer risk rating ('CRR') to external credit rating.\n\n## Wholesale lending\n\nThe CRR 10-grade scale summarises a more granular underlying 23-grade scale of obligor probability of default ('PD'). All corporate customers are rated using the 10- or 23-grade scale, depending on the degree of sophistication of the Basel approach adopted for the exposure.\n\nEach CRR band is associated with an external rating grade by reference to long-run default rates for that grade, represented by the average of issuer-weighted historical default rates. This mapping between internal and external ratings is indicative and may vary over time.\n\n## Retail lending\n\nRetail lending credit quality is based on a 12-month point-in-time probability-weighted PD.\n\n## Credit quality classification\n\n|                            | Sovereign debt  securities and bills   | Other debt  securities and bills   | Wholesale lending and derivatives   | Wholesale lending and derivatives          | Retail lending          | Retail lending                        |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                            | External credit  rating                | External credit  rating            | Internal credit  rating             | 12-month  Basel  probability of  default % | Internal credit  rating | 12 month  probability-  weighted PD % |\n| Quality classification 1,2 |                                        |                                    |                                     |                                            |                         |                                       |\n| Strong                     | BBB and above                          | A- and above                       | CRR 1 to CRR 2                      | 0-0.169                                    | Band 1 and 2            | 0.000-0.500                           |\n| Good                       | BBB- to BB                             | BBB+ to BBB-                       | CRR 3                               | 0.170-0.740                                | Band 3                  | 0.501-1.500                           |\n| Satisfactory               | BB- to B and  unrated                  | BB+ to B and  unrated              | CRR 4 to CRR 5                      | 0.741-4.914                                | Band 4 and 5            | 1.501-20.000                          |\n| Sub-standard               | B- to C                                | B- to C                            | CRR 6 to CRR 8                      | 4.915-99.999                               | Band 6                  | 20.001-99.999                         |\n| Credit impaired            | Default                                | Default                            | CRR 9 to CRR 10                     | 100                                        | Band 7                  | 100                                   |\n\n- 2 12-month point-in-time probability-weighted probability of default ('PD').\n\n## Quality classification definitions\n\n- -'Strong' exposures demonstrate a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, with negligible or low probability of default and/or low levels of expected loss.\n- -'Good' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate a good capacity to meet financial commitments, with low default risk.\n- -'Satisfactory' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate an average-to-fair capacity to meet financial commitments, with moderate default risk.\n- -'Sub-standard' exposures require varying degrees of special attention and default risk is of greater concern.\n- -'Credit-impaired' exposures have been assessed as described on Note 1.2(i) on the financial statements.\n\n## Forborne loans and advances\n\n## (Audited)\n\nForbearance measures consist of concessions towards an obligor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments.\n\nWe continue to class loans as forborne when we modify the contractual payment terms due to having significant concerns about the borrowers' ability to meet contractual payments when they were due. Our definition of forborne captures non-payment-related concessions, such as covenant waivers.\n\nFor details of our policy on forbearance, see Note 1.2(i) in the financial statements.\n\n## Credit quality of forborne loans\n\nFor wholesale lending, where payment-related forbearance measures result in a diminished financial obligation, or if there are other indicators of impairment, the loan will be classified as credit impaired if it is not already so classified. All facilities with a customer, including loans that have not been modified, are considered credit impaired following the identification of a payment-related forborne loan. For retail lending, where a material payment-related concession has been granted, the loan will be classified as credit impaired. In isolation, nonpayment forbearance measures may not result in the loan being classified as credit impaired unless combined with other indicators of credit impairment. These are classed as performing forborne loans for both wholesale and retail lending.\n\nWholesale and retail lending forborne loans are classified as credit impaired until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows, observed over a minimum one-year period, and there are no other indicators of impairment. Any forborne loans not considered credit impaired will\n\nremain forborne for a minimum of two years from the date that credit impairment no longer applies. For wholesale and retail lending, any forbearance measures granted on a loan already classed as forborne results in the customer being classed as credit impaired.\n\n## Forborne loans and recognition of expected credit losses\n\n(Audited)\n\nForborne loans expected credit loss assessments reflect the higher rates of losses typically experienced with these types of loans such that they are in stage 2 and stage 3. The higher rates are more pronounced in unsecured retail lending requiring further segmentation. For wholesale lending, forborne loans are typically assessed individually. Credit risk ratings are intrinsic to the impairment assessments. The individual impairment assessment takes into account the higher risk of the future non-payment inherent in forborne loans.\n\n## Impairment assessment\n\n(Audited)\n\nFor details of our impairment policies on loans and advances and financial investments, see Note 1.2(i) on the financial statements.\n\n## Write-off of loans and advances\n\n(Audited)\n\nUnder IFRS 9, write-off should occur when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering further cash flows from the financial asset.\n\nThis principle does not prohibit early write-off, which is defined in local policies to ensure effectiveness in the management of customers in the collections process.\n\nUnsecured personal facilities, including credit cards, are generally written off at between 150 and 210 days past due.

However, in exceptional circumstances, to avoid unfair customer outcomes, deliver customer duty or meet regulatory expectations, the period may be extended further.\n\nFor secured facilities, write-off should occur upon repossession of collateral, receipt of proceeds via settlement, or determination that recovery of the collateral will not be pursued. Where these assets are maintained on the balance sheet beyond 60 months of consecutive delinquency-driven default, the prospect of recovery is reassessed.\n\nRecovery activity, on both secured and unsecured assets, may continue after write-off.\n\nAny unsecured exposures that are not written off at 180 days past due, and any secured exposures that are in 'default' status for 60 months or greater but are not written off, are subject to additional monitoring via the appropriate governance forums.\n\n## Credit risk in 2023\n\nAt 31 December 2023, gross loans and advances to customers and banks of $1,063bn increased by $23.1bn, compared with 31 December 2022. This included favourable foreign exchange movements of $17.7bn.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the underlying increase of $5.4bn was driven by a $21.1bn rise in personal loans and advances to customers and a $8.9bn rise in loans and advances to banks. These were partly offset by a $24.6bn decrease in wholesale loans and advances to customers.\n\nThe underlying increase in personal loans and advances to customers was mainly driven by an increase in France (up $7.8bn) due to the retention of a portfolio of home loans and other loans previously classified as assets held for sale. It also comprised increases in the UK (up $6.6bn), in Hong Kong (up $5.8bn), in Mexico (up $2.3bn) and in Australia (up $1.4bn) driven by mortgage growth. These were partly offset by a decrease of $1.2bn due to the merger of our business in Oman and a decrease of $1.0bn due to the disposal of our retail mortgage loan portfolio in New Zealand.\n\nThe underlying increase in loans and advances to banks was driven by central bank balances and money market lending growth in Singapore (up $6.5bn), Hong Kong (up $5.1bn) and the UK (up $2.8bn). These were partly offset by decreases in mainland China (down $2.6bn), Malaysia (down $1.6bn) and Switzerland (down $1.4bn).\n\nThe underlying decrease in wholesale loans and advances to customers was driven by a $31.5bn reduction in corporate and commercial balances, of which $13.7bn in stage 1 and $16.8bn in stage 2. The decrease was observed mainly in Hong Kong (down $18.6bn), in the UK (down $5.4bn) and in mainland China (down $2.2bn), driven by repayments and deleveraging, as well as de-risking measures on mainland China commercial real estate exposures. It also comprised a decrease in Oman (down $2.1bn) due to the merger of our operations in the country. This was partly offset by an increase in balances with non-bank financial institutions (up $6.8bn) mainly in stage 1 in HSBC UK (up $5.2bn) due to the acquisition of SVB UK.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the allowance for ECL of $12.0bn decreased by $0.6bn compared with 31 December 2022, including adverse foreign exchange movements of $0.2bn. The $12.0bn allowance comprised $11.5bn in respect of assets held at amortised cost, $0.4bn in respect of loan commitments and financial guarantees, and $0.1bn in respect of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the allowance for ECL in relation to loans and advances to customers decreased by $0.6bn from 31 December 2022. This was attributable to:\n\n- -a $0.5bn decrease in wholesale loans and advances to customers driven by stages 1 and 2; and\n- -a $0.1bn decrease in personal loans and advances to customers driven by stages 1 and 2.\n\nStage 3 balances and allowances for ECL at 31 December 2023 remained broadly stable compared with 31 December 2022, as writeoffs and repayments offset new and additional allowances.\n\nIn wholesale lending, mainland China's commercial real estate sector continued to deteriorate in 2023, resulting in new and additional stage 3 charges during the year.\n\nThe ECL charge for 2023 was $3.4bn, inclusive of recoveries. This was driven by net stage 3 charges, including $1.0bn in the mainland China commercial real estate sector, as well as the impact of continued economic uncertainty in other markets, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.\n\nThe ECL charge comprised: $2.3bn in respect of wholesale lending, of which the stage 3 charge was $2.2bn; $1.0bn in respect of personal lending, of which $0.7bn were in stage 3; and $0.1bn in respect of debt instruments measured at FVOCI.\n\n## Income statement movements are analysed further on page 103.\n\nWhile credit risk arises across most of our balance sheet, ECL have typically been recognised on loans and advances to customers and banks, in addition to securitisation exposures and other structured products. As a result, our disclosures focus primarily on these two areas.

Change in ECL is recognised in 'Change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges' in the income statement.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the Group's credit risk by stage and industry, and the associated ECL coverage. The financial assets recorded in each stage have the following characteristics:\n\n- -Stage 1: These financial assets are unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk on which a 12-month allowance for ECL is recognised.\n- -Stage 2: A significant increase in credit risk has been experienced on these financial assets since initial recognition for which a lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\n- -Stage 3: There is objective evidence of impairment and the financial assets are therefore considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.\n- -POCI: Financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount are seen to reflect the incurred credit losses on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.",

It also sets out the reasons why an exposure is classified as stage 2 and therefore presented as a significant increase in credit risk at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe quantitative classification shows gross carrying amount and allowances for ECL for which the applicable reporting date probability of default ('PD') measure exceeds defined quantitative thresholds for\n\nretail and wholesale exposures, as set out in Note 1.2 'Summary of material accounting policies', on page 348.\n\nThe qualitative classification primarily accounts for customer risk rating ('CRR') deterioration, watch-and-worry and retail management judgemental adjustments.\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices for the significant increase in credit risk is set out in 'Summary of material accounting policies' on page 348.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers and banks 1,2\n\n|                                     | At 31 Dec 2023                  | At 31 Dec 2023                  | At 31 Dec 2023                  | At 31 Dec 2023                  | At 31 Dec 2023                  | At 31 Dec 2023                    | At 31 Dec 2023                   | At 31 Dec 2023     |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                     | Loans and advances to customers | Loans and advances to customers | Loans and advances to customers | Loans and advances to customers | Loans and advances to customers | Loans and advances to customers   |                                  |                    |\n|                                     |                                 | of which:                       | of which:                       | of which:                       |                                 |                                   | Loans and                        |                    |\n|                                     | Personal                        | first lien  mortgage            | credit  cards 3                 | other  personal  lending 3      | Corporate  and  commercial      | Non-bank  financial  institutions | advances  to banks at  amortised | cost Total stage 2 |\n|                                     | $m                              | $m                              | $m                              | $m                              | $m                              | $m                                | $m                               | $m                 |\n| Quantitative                        | 35,742                          | 31,178                          | 1,940                           | 2,624                           | 53,034                          | 2,955                             | 781                              | 92,512             |\n| Qualitative                         | 11,678                          | 7,077                           | 2,477                           | 2,124                           | 16,241                          | 653                               | 642                              | 29,214             |\n| of which: forbearance               | 171                             | 69                              | 34                              | 68                              | 982                             | 2                                 | -

Gross loans of our retail banking operations in France were $27.3bn, and the related allowance for ECL was $0.1bn.\n\nLending balances held for sale continue to be measured at amortised cost less allowances for impairment and, therefore, such carrying amounts may differ from fair value.\n\nThese lending balances are part of associated disposal groups that are measured in their entirety at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any difference between the carrying amount of these assets and their sales price is part of the overall gain or loss on the associated disposal group as a whole.\n\nFor further details of the carrying amount and the fair value at 31 December 2023 of loans and advances to banks and customers classified as held for sale, see Note 23 on the financial statements.\n\n## Gross loans and allowance for ECL on loans and advances to customers and banks reported in 'Assets held for sale'\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                    | Banking business in  Canada   | Banking business in  Canada   | Retail banking operations  in France   | Retail banking operations  in France   | Other                      | Other                 | Total                      | Total                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                    | Gross  carrying  amount $m    | Allowance  for ECL $m         | Gross  carrying  amount $m             | Allowance  for ECL $m                  | Gross  carrying  amount $m | Allowance  for ECL $m | Gross  carrying  amount $m | Allowance  for ECL $m |\n| Loans and advances to customers  at amortised cost | 56,349                        | (220)                         | 16,984                                 | (82)                                   | 255                        | (1)                   | 73,588                     | (303)                 |\n| -

Commentary on consolidated balance sheet movements in 2023 is provided on page 108. The offset of derivatives remains in line with the movements in maximum exposure amounts.\n\n## 'Maximum exposure to credit risk' table\n\nThe following table presents our maximum exposure before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (unless such enhancements meet accounting offsetting requirements).\n\nThe table excludes trading assets, financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss, and financial investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income as their carrying amount best represents the net exposure to credit risk. Equity securities are also excluded as they are not subject to credit risk. For the financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount and is net of the allowance for ECL. For financial guarantees and other guarantees granted, it is the maximum amount that we would have to pay if the guarantees were called upon. For loan commitments and other credit-related commitments, it is generally the full amount of the committed facilities.\n\nThe offset in the table relates to amounts where there is a legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and where, as a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis under normal circumstances, they do not qualify for net presentation for accounting purposes. No offset has been applied to off-balance sheet collateral. In the case of derivatives, the offset column also includes collateral received in cash and other financial assets.\n\n## Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                        | 2023                | 2023      | 2023      | 2022                | 2022      | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                        | Maximum exposure $m | Offset $m | Net $m    | Maximum exposure $m | Offset $m | Net $m    |\n| Loans and advances to customers held at amortised cost | 938,535             | (22,607)  | 915,928   | 923,561             | (20,315)  | 903,246   |\n| - personal                                             | 444,655             | (2,470)   | 442,185   | 412,012             | (2,575)   | 409,437   |\n| - corporate and commercial                             | 419,852             | (18,771)  | 401,081   | 444,882             | (16,262)  | 428,620   |\n| - non-bank financial institutions                      | 74,028              | (1,366)   | 72,662    | 66,667              | (1,478)   | 65,189    |\n| Loans and advances to banks at amortised cost          | 112,902             | -         | 112,902   | 104,475             | -         | 104,475   |\n| Other financial assets held at amortised cost          | 973,316             | (13,919)  | 959,397   | 970,119             | (8,969)   | 961,150   |\n| - cash and balances at central banks                   | 285,868             | -         | 285,868   | 327,002             | -         | 327,002   |\n| - items in the course of collection from other banks   | 6,342               | -         | 6,342     | 7,297               | -         | 7,297     |\n| - Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness    | 42,024              | -         | 42,024    | 43,787              | -         | 43,787    |\n| - reverse repurchase agreements - non-trading          | 252,217             | (13,919)  | 238,298   | 253,754             | (8,969)   | 244,785   |\n| - financial investments                                | 148,326             | -         | 148,326   | 109,066             | -         | 109,066   |\n| - assets held for sale                                 | 114,134             | -         | 114,134   | 115,919             | -         | 115,919   |\n| - prepayments, accrued income and other assets         | 124,405             | -         | 124,405   | 113,294             | -         | 113,294   |\n| Derivatives                                            | 229,714             | (222,059) | 7,655     | 284,159             | (273,497) | 10,662    |\n| Total on-balance sheet exposure to credit risk         | 2,254,467           | (258,585) | 1,995,882 | 2,282,314           | (302,781) | 1,979,533 |\n| Total off-balance sheet                                | 1,007,885           | -         | 1,007,885 | 934,329             | -         | 934,329   |\n| - financial and other guarantees                       | 111,102             | -         | 111,102   | 106,861             | -         | 106,861   |\n| - loan and other credit-related commitments            | 896,783             | -         | 896,783   | 827,468             | -         | 827,468   |\n| At 31 Dec                                              | 3,262,352           | (258,585) | 3,003,767 | 3,216,643           | (302,781) | 2,913,862 |\n\n## Concentration of exposure\n\nWe have a number of global businesses with a broad range of products.

        "page_content": "## Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe recognition and measurement of ECL involves the use of significant judgement and estimation. We form multiple economic scenarios based on economic forecasts, apply these assumptions to credit risk models to estimate future credit losses, and probability weight the results to determine an unbiased ECL estimate.\n\nManagement assessed the current economic environment, reviewed the latest economic forecasts and discussed key risks before selecting the economic scenarios and their weightings.\n\nScenarios were constructed to reflect the latest geopolitical risks and macroeconomic developments, including the Israel-Hamas war and subsequent disruptions in the Red Sea, and current inflation and monetary policy expectations.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments are used where modelled ECL does not fully reflect the identified risks and related uncertainty, or to capture significant late-breaking events.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, there was an overall reduction in management judgemental adjustments compared with 31 December 2022, as modelled outcomes better reflected the key risks at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Methodology\n\nAt 31 December 2023, four scenarios were used to capture the latest economic expectations and to articulate management's view of the range of risks and potential outcomes. Each scenario is updated with the latest economic forecasts and estimates every quarter.\n\nThree scenarios, the Upside, Central and Downside, are drawn from external consensus forecasts, market data and distributional estimates of the entire range of economic outcomes. The fourth scenario, the Downside 2, represents management's view of severe downside risks.\n\nThe Central scenario is deemed the 'most likely' scenario, and usually attracts the largest probability weighting. It is created using consensus forecasts, which is the average of a panel of external forecasts.\n\nThe outer scenarios represent the tails of the distribution and are less likely to occur. The consensus Upside and Downside scenarios are created with reference to distributions for select markets that capture forecasters' views of the entire range of economic outcomes. In the later years of those scenarios, projections revert to long-term consensus trend expectations. Reversion to trend is done with reference to historically observed quarterly changes in the values of macroeconomic variables.\n\nThe fourth scenario, the Downside 2, is designed to represent management's view of severe downside risks. It is a globally consistent, narrative-driven scenario that explores a more extreme economic outcome than those captured by the consensus scenarios. In this scenario, variables do not, by design, revert to long-term trend expectations and may instead explore alternative states of equilibrium, where economic activity moves permanently away from past trends.\n\nThe consensus Downside and the consensus Upside scenarios are each calibrated to be consistent with a 10% probability. The Downside 2 is calibrated to a 5% probability. The Central scenario is assigned the remaining 75%. This weighting scheme is deemed appropriate for the unbiased estimation of ECL in most circumstances. However, management may depart from this probability-based scenario weighting approach when the economic outlook and forecasts are determined to be particularly uncertain and risks are elevated.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the weights were consistent with the calibrated scenario probabilities, as key risk metrics implied a decline in the uncertainty attached to the Central scenario, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Economic forecasts for the Central scenario remained stable, and the dispersion within consensus forecast panels remained low, even as the Israel-Hamas war escalated. Risks, including the economic consequences of a broader war in the Middle East, were reflected in the Downside scenarios.\n\nScenarios produced to calculate ECL are aligned to HSBC's top and emerging risks.\n\n## Description of economic scenarios\n\nThe economic assumptions presented in this section have been formed by HSBC with reference to external forecasts and estimates, specifically for the purpose of calculating ECL.\n\nForecasts remain subject to uncertainty and variability. Outer scenarios are constructed so that they capture risks that could alter the trajectory of the economy and are designed to encompass the potential crystallisation of key macro-financial risks.\n\nIn our key markets, Central scenario forecasts remained broadly stable in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the third quarter of 2023. The key exception was with regard to monetary policy, where expectations for interest rate cuts were brought forward. There continue to be expectations that 2024 will be a period of below trend growth, with inflation remaining above central bank targets.\n\nAt the end of 2023, risks to the economic outlook included a number of significant geopolitical issues. Within our Downside scenarios, the economic consequences from the crystallisation of those risks were captured by higher commodity and goods prices, the reacceleration of inflation, a further rise in interest rates and a global recession.\n\nThe scenarios used to calculate ECL in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 are described below.\n\n## The consensus Central scenario\n\nHSBC's Central scenario reflects expectations for a low growth and high interest rate environment across many of our key markets, where GDP growth is expected to be lower in 2024 than in the previous year.\n\nExpectations of lower GDP growth in many markets in 2024 are driven by the assumed lagged effects of higher interest rates and inflation in North America and Europe. In the scenario, household discretionary income remains under pressure and business margins deteriorate amid higher refinancing costs. Growth only returns to its long-term expected trend in later years, once inflation reverts back towards central bank targets and interest rates stabilise at lower levels.\n\nIn mainland China and Hong Kong, growth is also expected to be moderately slower in 2024 relative to 2023. The economic boost from post-pandemic reopening has faded, and slower global growth and low trade volumes are expected to moderate activity. In mainland China, the continued fall in investment in the property sector is expected to act as a further brake on the economy, while in Hong Kong, higher interest rates are expected to drive a further decline in property valuations. Despite these headwinds, a steeper downturn is expected to be avoided as the authorities in mainland China increase fiscal and monetary support to the economy. Substantial fiscal expansion is anticipated for 2024, alongside additional credit easing.\n\nGlobal GDP is expected to grow by 2.2% in 2024 in the Central scenario, and the average rate of global GDP growth is forecast to be 2.6% over the five-year forecast period. This is below the average growth rate over the five-year period prior to the onset of the pandemic of 2.9%.\n\nThe key features of our Central scenario are:\n\n- -GDP growth rates in our main markets are expected to slow down in 2024, followed by a moderate recovery in 2025. The slowdown in the UK is particularly notable in this scenario, with growth close to zero through much of 2024. In the scenario, weaker growth is caused by high interest rates, which act to deter consumption and investment.\n- -In most markets, unemployment is expected to rise moderately as economic activity slows, although it remains low by historical standards.",

        "page_content": "- -Inflation is expected to continue to fall as commodity prices decline, supply disruptions abate, and wage growth moderates. It is anticipated that inflation converges towards central banks' target rates by early 2025. In mainland China, weak consumption and excess supply has caused inflation to drop sharply but, in the scenario, deflation is not projected to persist.\n- -Weak conditions in housing markets are expected to persist through 2024 and 2025 in many of our main markets, including the UK, Hong Kong and mainland China, as higher interest rates and, in many cases, declining prices, depress activity.\n- -Policy interest rates in key markets are forecast to have peaked and are projected to decline in 2024. In the longer term, they are expected to remain at a higher level than in recent years.\n- -The Brent crude oil price is forecast to average around $75 per barrel over the projection period.\n\nThe Central scenario was created with forecasts available in late November, and reviewed continually until the end of December 2023. In accordance with HSBC's scenario framework, a probability weight of 75% has been assigned to the Central scenario across all major markets.\n\n- -Challenging conditions are also forecast to continue in the commercial property sector in a number of our key markets.

        "page_content": "## Downside scenarios\n\nDownside scenarios explore the intensification and crystallisation of a number of key economic and financial risks. These include an escalation of geopolitical tensions, which disrupt key commodity and goods markets, causing inflation and interest rates to rise, and creating a global recession.\n\nAs the geopolitical environment remains volatile and complex, risks include:\n\n- -a broader and more prolonged conflict in the Middle East that undermines confidence, drives an increase in global energy costs and reduces trade and investment;\n- -a potential escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, which expands beyond Ukraine's borders, and further disrupts energy, fertiliser and food supplies; and\n- -continued differences between the US and China, which could affect economic confidence, the global goods trade and supply chains for critical technologies.\n\nA wage-price spiral, triggered by higher inflation and labour supply shortages, could put sustained upward pressure on wages and services prices, aggravating cost pressures and increasing the squeeze on household real incomes and corporate margins. In turn, it raises the risk of a more forceful policy response from central banks, a steeper trajectory for interest rates, significantly higher defaults and, ultimately, a deep economic recession.\n\n## The consensus Downside scenario\n\nIn the consensus Downside scenario, economic activity is weaker compared with the Central scenario. In this scenario, GDP declines, unemployment rates rise, and asset prices fall. The scenario features an escalation of geopolitical tensions, which causes a rise in inflation, as supply chain constraints intensify and energy prices rise. The scenario also features a temporary increase in interest rates above the Central scenario, before the effects of weaker consumption demand begin to dominate and commodity prices and inflation fall again.\n\nHigh inflation and higher interest rates also remain key risks. Should geopolitical tensions escalate, energy and food prices could rise and increase pressure on household budgets and firms' costs.\n\nThe following tables describe key macroeconomic variables in the consensus Downside scenario.\n\n## Consensus Downside scenario 2024-2028 (as at 4Q23)\n\n|                                           | UK     | UK     | US    | US     | Hong Kong   | Hong Kong   | Mainland  China   | Mainland  China   | Canada   | Canada   | France   | France   |   UAE | UAE    | Mexico   | Mexico   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------|--------|----------|----------|\n| GDP level  (%, start-to-trough) 1         | (1.0)  | (2Q25) | (1.4) | (3Q24) | (1.6)       | (3Q25)      | (1.5)             | (1Q24)            | (1.7)    | (3Q24)   | (0.3)    | (2Q24)   |   1.4 | (1Q24) | (0.3)    | (4Q24)   |\n| Unemployment rate  (%, max) 2             | 6.4    | (1Q25) | 5.6   | (4Q24) | 4.7         | (4Q25)      | 6.9               | (4Q25)            | 7.4      | (3Q24)   | 8.5      | (4Q24)   |   3.7 | (4Q25) | 3.5      | (4Q25)   |\n| House price index  (%, start-to-trough) 1 | (12.0) | (2Q25) | (1.3) | (3Q24) | (9.6)       | (4Q24)      | (7.1)             | (3Q25)            | (12.0)   | (3Q25)   | (1.2)    | (3Q24)   |   0.3 | (1Q24) | 1.2      | (1Q24)   |\n| Inflation rate  (YoY % change, max) 3     | 4.1    | (1Q24) | 3.5   | (4Q24) | 3.8         | (3Q24)      | 3.5               | (4Q24)            | 3.4      | (2Q24)   | 3.8      | (2Q24)   |   3   | (1Q24) | 6.5      | (4Q24)   |\n| Central bank policy rate  (%, max) 2      | 5.7    | (1Q24) | 5.6   | (1Q24) | 6.0         | (1Q24)      | 4.1               | (3Q24)            | 5.6      | (1Q24)   | 4.2      | (1Q24)   |   5.7 | (1Q24) | 12.0     | (3Q24)   |\n\n- 1 Cumulative change to the lowest level of the series during the 20-quarter projection.\n- 2 The highest projected unemployment or policy interest rate in the scenario.\n- 3 The highest projected year-on-year percentage change in inflation in the scenario.\n\n## Consensus Downside scenario 2023-2027 (as at 4Q22)\n\n|                                           | UK     | UK     | US     | US     | Hong Kong   | Hong Kong   | Mainland  China   | Mainland  China   | Canada   | Canada   | France   | France   | UAE   | UAE    | Mexico   | Mexico   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------|--------|----------|----------|\n| GDP level  (%, start-to-trough) 1         | (3.0)  | (1Q25) | (4.0)  | (4Q24) | (2.3)       | (3Q24)      | (1.7)             | (2Q23)            | (3.9)    | (4Q23)   | (0.9)    | (2Q23)   | 0.1   | (1Q23) | (2.8)    | (4Q24)   |\n| Unemployment rate  (%, max) 2             | 5.8    | (2Q24) | 5.9    | (1Q24) | 5.2         | (3Q24)      | 5.9               | (4Q23)            | 7.6      | (3Q23)   | 8.8      | (4Q23)   | 4.1   | (3Q23) | 4.4      | (1Q23)   |\n| House price index  (%, start-to-trough) 1 | (15.0) | (4Q24) | (11.6) | (4Q25) | (11.9)      | (1Q24)      | (1.0)             | (4Q23)            | (20.1)   | (4Q24)   | (0.7)    | (3Q23)   | (4.0) | (3Q23) | 1.2      | (1Q23)   |\n| Inflation rate  (YoY % change, max) 3     | 10.8   | (1Q23) | 6.2    | (1Q23) | 3.7         | (4Q23)      | 4.0               | (4Q23)            | 6.0      | (1Q23)   | 7.2      | (1Q23)   | 4.5   | (1Q23) | 7.9      | (1Q23)   |\n| Central bank policy rate  (%, max) 2      | 5.1    | (3Q23) | 5.2    | (3Q23) | 5.7         | (3Q23)      | 5.2               | (4Q23)            | 5.6      | (3Q23)   | 3.4      | (4Q23)   | 6.6   | (3Q23) | 12.1     | (3Q23)   |\n\n- 1 Cumulative change to the lowest level of the series during the 20-quarter projection.\n- 2 The highest projected unemployment or policy interest rate in the scenario.\n- 3 The highest projected year-on-year percentage change in inflation in the scenario.\n\n## Downside 2 scenario\n\nThe Downside 2 scenario features a deep global recession and reflects management's view of the tail of the economic distribution. It incorporates the crystallisation of a number of risks simultaneously, including a further escalation of geopolitical crises globally, which creates severe supply disruptions to goods and energy markets.\n\nIn the scenario, as inflation surges and central banks tighten monetary policy further, confidence evaporates. However, this impulse is assumed to prove short lived, as recession takes hold, causing commodity prices to correct sharply and global price inflation to fall.",

It was noted that despite the escalation of geopolitical risk in the Middle East, economic forecasts had remained stable, and dispersion of forecasts around the consensus were either stable, or have moved lower. Financial market measures of volatility also remained low through the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThis has led management to assign scenario probabilities that are aligned to the standard scenario probability calibration framework. This entailed assigning a 75% probability weighting to the Central scenario in our major markets. The consensus Upside scenario was awarded a 10% weighting, and the consensus Downside scenario was given 10%. The Downside 2 was assigned a 5% weighting.\n\nIn support of the decision, it was noted that in mainland China recent policy announcements suggest fiscal and monetary stimulus will\n\nThe following tables describe the probabilities assigned in each scenario.\n\n## Scenario weightings, %\n\n|                     | Standard  weights   | UK   | US   | Hong  Kong   | Mainland  China   | Canada   | France   | UAE   | Mexico   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|------|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|----------|-------|----------|\n| 4Q23                |                     |      |      |              |                   |          |          |       |          |\n| Upside scenario     | 10                  | 10   | 10   | 10           | 10                | 10       | 10       | 10    | 10       |\n| Central scenario    | 75                  | 75   | 75   | 75           | 75                | 75       | 75       | 75    | 75       |\n| Downside scenario   | 10                  | 10   | 10   | 10           | 10                | 10       | 10       | 10    | 10       |\n| Downside 2 scenario | 5                   | 5    | 5    | 5            | 5                 | 5        | 5        | 5     | 5        |\n| 4Q22                |                     |      |      |              |                   |          |          |       |          |\n| Upside scenario     | 10                  | 5    | 5    | 20           | 20                | 5        | 5        | 5     | 5        |\n| Central scenario    | 75                  | 60   | 70   | 55           | 55                | 70       | 60       | 70    | 70       |\n| Downside scenario   | 10                  | 25   | 20   | 20           | 20                | 15       | 25       | 20    | 20       |\n| Downside 2 scenario | 5                   | 10   | 5    | 5            | 5                 | 10       | 10       | 5     | 5        |\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the consensus Upside and Central scenarios for all markets had a combined weighting of 85%. At 31 December 2022, mainland China, Hong Kong and the US each had a combined weighting of 75% for the consensus Upside and Central scenarios. The UK had a combined weighting of 65%.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe calculation of ECL under IFRS 9 involved significant judgements, assumptions and estimates at 31 December 2023. These included:\n\n- -the selection of weights to apply to the economic scenarios given the rapidly changing economic conditions and the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast under each scenario;\n- -the selection of scenarios to consider given the changing nature of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks that the Group and wider economy faces; and\n- -estimating the economic effects of those scenarios on ECL, particularly sector and portfolio-specific risks, and the uncertainty of default and recovery experience under all scenarios.\n\n## How economic scenarios are reflected in ECL calculations\n\nModels are used to reflect economic scenarios on ECL estimates. As described above, modelled assumptions and linkages based on historical information could not alone produce relevant information under the conditions experienced in 2023, and management judgemental adjustments were still required to support modelled outcomes.\n\nWe have developed globally consistent methodologies for the application of forward economic guidance into the calculation of ECL for wholesale and retail credit risk. These standard approaches are described below, followed by the management judgemental adjustments made, including those to reflect the circumstances experienced in 2023.\n\nincrease significantly through 2024. This suggests that there will be increased official support to current economic headwinds, which would reduce the uncertainty attached to current forecasts.\n\nIn the UK, the Central scenario reflects a weak growth environment in which recession risks remain high. Similarly, in the US, the Central scenario reflects expectations for a weaker growth environment in 2024 as the economy adjusts to the higher rates environment.\n\nFor the UAE, it was agreed that there has been an increase in geopolitical uncertainty since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, with the potential for regional escalation remaining a risk. However, economic and market impacts have been limited and oil production remains unaffected.\n\nManagement concluded that consensus expectations for Mexico, France and Canada were also consistent with its view of the economic outlook, while assessments of uncertainty were also aligned to historical averages.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, management varied the applied scenario weights to reflect greater uncertainty around the inflation and interest rate outlook, amid supply disruption to energy and food commodity markets due to the Ukraine-Russia war. In Hong Kong and mainland China, uncertainty assessments focused on the upside and downside risks of post-pandemic reopening.\n\nThose factors were reflected in the measures of risk and uncertainty used to inform judgements around the Central scenario. In particular, large forecast changes were observed, alongside wide dispersion of forecasts around consensus estimates and heightened financial market volatility.",

        "page_content": "For our wholesale portfolios, a global methodology is used for the estimation of the term structure of probability of default ('PD') and loss given default ('LGD'). For PDs, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to default rates for a particular industry in a country. For LGD calculations, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to collateral values and realisation rates for a particular country and industry. PDs and LGDs are estimated for the entire term structure of each instrument.\n\nFor impaired loans, allowance for ECL estimates are derived based on discounted cash flow ('DCF') calculations for internal forward-looking scenarios specific to individual borrower circumstances (see page 348). Probability-weighted outcomes are applied, and depending on materiality and status of the borrower, the number of scenarios considered will change. Where relevant for the case being assessed, forward economic guidance is incorporated as part of these scenarios. LGD-driven proxy and modelled estimates are used for certain less material cases.\n\nFor our retail portfolios, the models are predominantly based on historical observations and correlations with default rates and collateral values.\n\nFor PD, the impact of economic scenarios is modelled for each portfolio, using historical relationships between default rates and macroeconomic variables. These are included within IFRS 9 ECL estimates using either economic response models or models that contain internal, external and macroeconomic variables. The macroeconomic impact on PD is modelled over the period equal to the remaining maturity of the underlying assets.\n\nFor LGD, the impact is modelled for mortgage portfolios by forecasting future loan-to-value profiles for the remaining maturity of the asset, using national level house price index forecasts and applying the corresponding LGD expectation relative to the updated forecast collateral values.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments are described below.\n\n## Management judgemental adjustments\n\nIn the context of IFRS 9, management judgemental adjustments are typically short-term increases or decreases to the modelled allowance for ECL at either a customer, segment or portfolio level where management believes allowances do not sufficiently reflect the credit risk/expected credit losses at the reporting date. These can relate to risks or uncertainties that are not reflected in the models and/or to any late-breaking events with significant uncertainty, subject to management review and challenge.\n\nThis includes refining model inputs and outputs and using adjustments to ECL based on management judgement and quantitative analysis for impacts that are difficult to model.\n\nThe effects of management judgemental adjustments are considered for both balances and allowance for ECL when determining whether or not a significant increase in credit risk has occurred and is allocated to a stage where appropriate. This is in accordance with the internal adjustments framework.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments are reviewed under the governance process for IFRS 9 (as detailed in the section 'Credit risk management' on page 147). Review and challenge focuses on the rationale and quantum of the adjustments with a further review carried out by the second line of defence where significant. For some management judgemental adjustments, internal frameworks establish the conditions under which these adjustments should no longer be required and as such are considered as part of the governance process. This internal governance process allows management judgemental adjustments to be reviewed regularly and, where possible, to reduce the reliance on these through model recalibration or redevelopment, as appropriate.\n\nThe drivers of management judgemental adjustments continue to evolve with the economic environment and as new risks emerge.\n\nIn addition to management judgemental adjustments there are also 'Other adjustments', which are made to address process limitations and data/model deficiencies.\n\n'Management judgemental adjustments' and 'Other adjustments' constitute the total value of adjustments to modelled allowance for ECL. For the wholesale portfolio, defaulted exposures are assessed individually and management judgemental adjustments are made only to the performing portfolio.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, there was a $0.2bn reduction in management judgemental adjustments compared with 31 December 2022. For the wholesale portfolio, this was due to modelled outcomes better reflecting the key risks at 31 December 2023. For the retail portfolio, there was an increase in other credit judgements due to the potential delayed impact of economic scenarios on unsecured portfolio defaults, primarily within the UK .\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments made in estimating the scenario-weighted reported allowance for ECL at 31 December 2023 are set out in the following table.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments to ECL at 31 December 2023 1\n\n|                                                                    | Retail $bn   | Wholesale 2 $bn   |   Total $bn |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Modelled ECL (A) 3                                                 | 2.6          | 2.4               |         5   |\n| Banks, sovereigns, government entities and low-risk counterparties |              | 0.0               |         0   |\n| Corporate lending adjustments                                      |              | 0.1               |         0.1 |\n| Inflation related adjustments                                      | 0.1          |                   |         0.1 |\n| Other credit judgements                                            | 0.5          |                   |         0.5 |\n| Total management judgemental adjustments (B) 4                     | 0.6          | 0.1               |         0.7 |\n| Other adjustments (C) 5                                            | 0.0          | 0.0               |         0   |\n| Final ECL (A + B + C) 6                                            | 3.2          | 2.5               |         5.7 |",

These can relate to risks or uncertainties that are not reflected in the model and/or to any latebreaking events.\n- 5 (C) refers to adjustments to allowance for ECL made to address process limitations and data/model deficiencies.\n- 6 As presented within our internal credit risk governance (see page 147).\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments at 31 December 2023 were an increase to allowance for ECL of $0.1bn for the wholesale portfolio and an increase to ECL of $0.6bn for the retail portfolio.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, wholesale management judgemental adjustments were an increase to allowance for ECL of $0.1bn (31 December 2022: $0.6bn increase).\n\n- -Management judgemental adjustments to corporate exposures increased allowance for ECL by $0.1bn at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $0.5bn increase), mostly due to management judgements to reflect heightened uncertainty in specific sectors and geographies, including adjustments to exposures to the real estate sectors in mainland China, the UK and the US. The decrease in adjustments to allowances compared with 31 December 2022 is attributed to a crystallisation of existing risks at that date through downgrades, and an improved reflection of emerging risks in macroeconomic scenarios and modelled outcomes.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, retail management judgemental adjustments were an increase to allowance for ECL of $0.6bn (31 December 2022: $0.3bn increase). The increase in adjustments to allowance for ECL compared with 31 December 2022 was primarily due to the increase in management judgemental adjustments in other credit judgements (detailed below).\n\n- -Management judgemental adjustments in relation to inflation increased allowance for ECL by $0.1bn (31 December 2022: $0.1bn). These adjustments addressed where increasing inflation and interest rates result in affordability risks that were not fully captured by the modelled output.\n- -Management judgemental adjustments in relation to other credit judgements increased allowance for ECL by $0.5bn (31 December 2022: $0.2bn). These adjustments were primarily to capture the potential delayed impact of economic scenarios on unsecured portfolio defaults in the UK.\n\n## Economic scenarios sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates\n\nManagement considered the sensitivity of the ECL outcome against the economic forecasts as part of the ECL governance process by recalculating the allowance for ECL under each scenario described above for selected portfolios, applying a 100% weighting to each scenario in turn. The weighting is reflected in both the determination of a significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of the resulting allowances.\n\nThe allowance for ECL calculated for the Upside and Downside scenarios should not be taken to represent the upper and lower limits of possible ECL outcomes. The impact of defaults that might occur in the future under different economic scenarios is captured by recalculating allowances for loans at the balance sheet date.\n\nThere is a particularly high degree of estimation uncertainty in numbers representing tail risk scenarios when assigned a 100% weighting.\n\nFor wholesale credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis excludes allowance for ECL and financial instruments related to defaulted (stage 3) obligors. The measurement of stage 3 ECL is relatively more sensitive to credit factors specific to the obligor than future economic scenarios, and therefore the effects of macroeconomic factors are not necessarily the key consideration when performing individual assessments of allowances for obligors in default. Loans to defaulted obligors are a small portion of the overall wholesale lending exposure, even if representing the majority of the allowance for ECL. Due to the range and specificity of the credit factors to which the ECL is sensitive, it is not possible to provide a meaningful alternative sensitivity analysis for a consistent set of risks across all defaulted obligors.\n\nFor retail mortgage exposures the sensitivity analysis includes allowance for ECL for defaulted obligors of loans and advances. This is because the retail ECL for secured mortgage portfolios, including loans in all stages, is sensitive to macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Wholesale and retail sensitivity\n\nThe wholesale and retail sensitivity tables present the 100% weighted results. These exclude portfolios held by the insurance business and small portfolios, and as such cannot be directly compared with personal and wholesale lending presented in other credit risk tables. In both the wholesale and retail analysis, the comparative period results for Downside 2 scenarios are also not directly comparable with the current period, because they reflect different risks relative to the consensus scenarios for the period end.\n\nThe wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis is stated inclusive of management judgemental adjustments, as appropriate to each scenario.\n\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios, the gross carrying amount of financial instruments are the same under each scenario. For exposures with similar risk profile and product characteristics, the sensitivity impact is therefore largely the result of changes in macroeconomic assumptions.",

includes off-balance sheet financial instruments. These are subject to significant measurement uncertainty.\n- 2 Includes low credit-risk financial instruments such as debt instruments at FVOCI, which have high carrying amounts but low ECL under all the above scenarios.\n- 3 Excludes defaulted obligors. For a detailed breakdown of performing and non-performing wholesale portfolio exposures, see page 176.\n- 4 Staging refers only to probability-weighted/reported gross carrying amount. Stage allocation of gross exposures varies by scenario, with higher allocation to stage 2 under the Downside 2 scenario.\n- 5 Classified as held for sale at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.\n- 6   Includes small portfolios that use less complex modelling approaches and are not sensitive to macroeconomic changes.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the highest level of 100% scenario-weighted allowance for ECL was observed in the UK and Hong Kong. This higher ECL impact was largely driven by significant exposure in these regions.\n\nCompared with 31 December 2022, the Downside 2 allowance for ECL was lower in Hong Kong and mainland China, mostly due to the crystallisation of defaults for certain high-risk exposures and a decrease of the associated downside uncertainty.\n\nIn the wholesale portfolio, off-balance sheet financial instruments have a lower likelihood to be fully converted to a funded exposure at the point of default, and consequently the sensitivity of the allowance for ECL is lower in relation to its nominal amount, when compared with an on-balance sheet exposure with a similar risk profile.",

Hong Kong. Mortgages reflected the lowest level of allowance for ECL sensitivity across most markets given the significant levels of collateral relative to the exposure values. Credit cards and other unsecured lending across stage 1 and 2 are more sensitive to economic forecasts and therefore reflected the highest level of allowance for ECL sensitivity during 2023.\n\nThere is limited sensitivity in credit cards and other unsecured lending in stage 3 as levels of loss on defaulted exposures remain consistent through various economic conditions. The alternative downside is from the tail of the economic distribution where allowance for ECL is more sensitive based on historical experience.\n\nThe reported gross carrying amount by stage is representative of the weighted scenario allowance for ECL. The allowance for ECL sensitivity to the other scenarios includes changes in allowance for ECL due to the levels of loss and the migration of additional lending balances in or out of stage 2.\n\n## Group ECL sensitivity results\n\nThe allowance for ECL of the scenarios and management judgemental adjustments is highly sensitive to movements in economic forecasts. Based upon the sensitivity tables presented above, if the Group allowance for ECL balance was estimated solely on the basis of the Central scenario, Downside scenario or the Downside 2 scenario at 31 December 2023, it would increase/ (decrease) as presented in the below table.\n\n| Total Group ECL at 31 December 2023   | Retail 1 $bn   | Wholesale 1 $bn   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Reported allowance for ECL            | 3.0            | 2.5               |\n| Scenarios                             |                |                   |\n| 100% Consensus Central scenario       | (0.1)          | (0.2)             |\n| 100% Consensus Upside scenario        | (0.5)          | (0.7)             |\n| 100% Consensus Downside scenario      | 0.4            | 0.8               |\n| 100% Downside 2 scenario              | 2.1            | 4.5               |\n| Total Group ECL at 31 December 2022   |                |                   |\n| Reported allowance for ECL            | 3.0            | 3.1               |\n| Scenarios                             |                |                   |\n| 100% Consensus Central scenario       | (0.2)          | (0.5)             |\n| 100% Consensus Upside scenario        | (0.6)          | (1.1)             |\n| 100% Consensus Downside scenario      | 0.4            | 0.8               |\n| 100% Downside 2 scenario              | 1.8            | 5.5               |",

Within the retail portfolio, the increase in the Downside 2\n\nscenario sensitivity was due to portfolio growth in Mexico and scenario forecast deterioration in Hong Kong.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the sensitivity of the allowance for ECL to the consensus Central and consensus Upside scenarios decreased for both retail and wholesale portfolios due to lower macroeconomic forecast uncertainty, and the return to standardised weighting for the probability-weighted reported allowance.\n\n## Reconciliation from reported exposure and ECL to sensitised exposure and weighted ECL\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                              | Wholesale                          | Wholesale          | Retail                            | Retail             | Total                             | Total              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                              | Gross carrying/  nominal amount $m | Allowance  for ECL | Gross carrying/ nominal amount $m | Allowance  for ECL | Gross carrying/ nominal amount $m | Allowance  for ECL |\n|                                                                                                                                                                              |                                    | $m                 |                                   | $m                 |                                   | $m                 |\n| Included in sensitivity analysis                                                                                                                                             | 1,990,378                          | (2,507)            | 442,373                           | (2,962)            | 2,432,751                         | (5,469)            |\n| -

If movements were calculated on a year-to-date basis they would only reflect the opening and closing position of the financial instrument.\n\nThe transfers of financial instruments represents the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL.\n\nThe net remeasurement of ECL arising from transfer of stage represents the increase or decrease due to these transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (stage 1) to a lifetime (stage 2) ECL measurement basis. Net remeasurement excludes the underlying customer risk rating ('CRR')/probability of default ('PD') movements of the financial instruments transferring stage. This is captured, along with other credit quality movements in the 'changes to risk parameters - credit quality' line item.\n\nChanges in 'Net new and further lending/repayments' represents the impact from volume movements within the Group's lending portfolio and includes 'New financial assets originated or purchased', 'assets derecognised (including final repayments)' and 'changes to risk parameters - further lending/repayment'.",

The credit quality of financial instruments is a point-in-time assessment of PD, whereas stages 1 and 2 are determined based on relative deterioration of credit quality since initial recognition for the majority of portfolios. Accordingly, for non-creditimpaired financial instruments, there is no direct relationship between the credit quality assessment and stages 1 and 2, although\n\ntypically the lower credit quality bands exhibit a higher proportion in stage 2.\n\nThe five credit quality classifications provided below each encompass a range of granular internal credit rating grades assigned to wholesale and personal lending businesses and the external ratings attributed by external agencies to debt securities, as shown in the table on page 148.\n\n## Distribution of financial instruments by credit quality at 31 December 2023\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                                                                              | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | for ECL/                            |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                                                                                                              | Strong $m                        | Good                             | Satisfactory                     | Sub- standard                    | Credit  impaired $m              | Total $m                         | Allowance  other credit  provisions | Net $m    |\n|                                                                                                              |                                  | $m                               | $m                               | $m                               |                                  |                                  | $m                                  |           |\n| In-scope for IFRS 9 ECL                                                                                      |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                     |           |\n| Loans and advances to  customers held at amortised cost                                                      | 497,665                          | 206,476                          | 197,582                          | 28,532                           | 19,354                           | 949,609                          | (11,074)                            | 938,535   |\n| -

If such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed\n\nto occur when an exposure is 90 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise credit impaired.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nThe following table shows the gross carrying amounts and allowances for ECL of the Group's holdings of forborne loans and advances to customers by industry sector and by stages.\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices for forbearance is set out in 'Credit risk management' on page 147.\n\n## Forborne loans and advances to customers at amortised cost by stage allocation\n\n|                                                        | Performing forborne   | Non-performing forborne   | Non-performing forborne   | Total forborne   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n|                                                        | Stage 2               | Stage 3                   | POCI                      | Total            |\n|                                                        | $m                    | $m                        | $m                        | $m               |\n| Gross carrying amount                                  |                       |                           |                           |                  |\n| Personal                                               | 816                   | 1,282                     | -

entities, countries, territories and products comprising wholesale loans and advances to customers and banks. Product granularity is also provided by stage with legal entity data presented for loans and advances to customers, banks, other credit commitments, financial guarantees and similar contracts. Additionally, this section provides a reconciliation of the opening 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 closing gross carrying/nominal amounts and the associated allowance for ECL.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, wholesale lending for loans and advances to banks and customers of $615bn decreased by $9.6bn compared with 31 December 2022. This included favourable foreign exchange movements of $6.1bn. Excluding foreign exchange movements, the total loans and advances to customers decrease of $24.6bn was driven by a $31.5bn decrease in corporate and commercial balances, partly offset by a $6.9bn increase in balances from non-bank financial institutions. In addition, there was a $8.9bn increase in loans and advances to banks.\n\nThe underlying reduction in corporate and commercial lending was mainly driven by decreases in Hong Kong (down $18.6bn), in the UK (down $5.4bn), in mainland China (down $2.2bn), in France (down $1.6bn), in the US (down $1.3bn). These were partly offset by increased lending in India (up $1.8bn). There was a $2.1bn decrease from the merger of our business in Oman.\n\nThe underlying decrease in loans advances to corporate and commercial customers within stage 2 included repayments within our commercial real estate portfolio in Hong Kong, together with derisking measures in our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. In addition, there was a further decrease in the wholesale and retail trade portfolio in the UK largely from repayments and improvements in the economic outlook that led to upgrades to stage 1.\n\nThe underlying growth in loans and advances to non-bank financial institutions was mainly driven by the formation of HSBC Innovation Banking, following the acquisition of SVB UK, in the UK (up $6.4bn). In addition, increases in France (up $1.4bn) were partly offset by decreases in mainland China (down $0.9bn).\n\nThe underlying growth in loans and advances to banks was mainly driven by central bank balances and money market lending growth in Singapore (up $6.5bn), Hong Kong (up $5.1bn), the UK (up $2.8bn) and Egypt (up $1.5bn). These were partly offset by reductions in mainland China (down $2.6bn), Malaysia (down $1.6bn), Switzerland (down $1.4bn) and the UAE (down $1.2bn). There was also a $0.6bn decrease from the merger of our business in Oman.\n\nLoan commitments and financial guarantees increased by $27.5bn since 31 December 2022 to $419.9bn at 31 December 2023. Excluding favourable foreign exchange movements of $8.7bn, loan commitments and financial guarantees grew by $18.8bn. This can be mainly attributed to a $23.2bn increase in unsettled reverse repurchase agreements, partly offset by a decrease of $6.3bn in loan commitments with corporate and commercial customers.\n\nThe allowance for ECL attributable to loans and advances to banks and customers of $8.2bn at 31 December 2023 decreased from $8.6bn at 31 December 2022. This included adverse foreign exchange movements of $0.1bn.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the total decrease in the wholesale allowance for ECL attributable to loans and advances to customers and banks was mostly driven by a $0.6bn decrease in corporate and commercial balances, partly offset by a $0.1bn increase in loans to non-bank financial institutions and banks.\n\nThe allowance for ECL attributable to loan commitments and financial guarantees at 31 December 2023 remained stable at $0.4bn compared with 31 December 2022.\n\nThe table below provides a breakdown by industry sector and stage of the Group's gross carrying amount and allowances for ECL for wholesale loans and advances to banks and customers. Counterparties or exposures are classified when presenting comparable economic characteristics, or engaged in similar activities so that their collective ability to meet contractual obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Therefore, the industry classification does not adhere to Nomenclature des Activit\u00e9s \u00c9conomiques dans la Communaut\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne ('NACE'), which is applicable to other financial regulatory reporting.",

This was partly offset by $1,149m relating to underlying net book volume movement, $16m in changes to models used for ECL calculation and $15m relating to the net remeasurement impact of stage transfers.\n\nDuring the period, there was a net transfer to stage 2 of $15,739m gross carrying/nominal amounts. It was primarily driven by $8,792m in Hong Kong, mainly due to deterioration in the real estate and construction sectors, and $6,273m in the UK, mainly driven by increased interest rates affecting the corporate and commercial portfolio.",

The portfolio has larger concentrations in Hong Kong, the UK, mainland China and the US.\n\nOur global exposure is centred largely on cities with economic, political or cultural significance. In more developed markets, our exposure mainly comprises the financing of investment assets, the redevelopment of existing stock and the augmentation of both commercial and residential markets to support economic and population growth. In less developed commercial real estate markets, our exposures comprise lending for development assets on relatively\n\nshort tenors with a particular focus on supporting larger, better capitalised developers involved in residential construction or assets supporting economic expansion.\n\nExcluding favourable foreign exchange movements of $1.1bn, commercial real estate lending decreased by $13.8bn, mainly from $7.4bn in Hong Kong due to loan repayments. The decrease included loan sales of $0.5bn in the US as part of an initiative to reduce the portfolio exposure.\n\nDespite the lower exposure, allowance for  ECL remained at $2.8bn, reflecting the challenging conditions in the commercial property sector, including the impact of lower valuations in the office segment.\n\n## Commercial real estate lending to customers\n\n|                                  |                      |                   |                                                             |                                     |                                           |                                           |                             | of which:   | of which:   | of which:     |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n|                                  | HSBC UK  Bank plc $m | HSBC  Bank plc $m | The Hongkong and  Shanghai Banking  Corporation  Limited $m | HSBC Bank  Middle  East  Limited $m | HSBC  North  America  Holdings  Inc. 1 $m | Grupo  Financiero  HSBC, S.A.  de C.V. $m | Other  trading  entities $m | Total $m    | UK $m       | Hong  Kong $m |\n| Gross loans  and advances        |                      |                   |                                                             |                                     |                                           |                                           |                             |             |             |               |\n| Stage 1                          | 10,304               | 4,218             | 41,307                                                      | 1,126                               | 1,803                                     | 685                                       | 440                         | 59,883      | 10,790      | 28,846        |\n| Stage 2                          | 3,262                | 400               | 13,229                                                      | 189                                 | 1,956                                     | 70                                        | 1                           | 19,107      | 3,294       | 10,375        |\n| Stage 3                          | 444                  | 184               | 3,570                                                       | 145                                 | 166                                       | 25                                        | 18                          | 4,552       | 470         | 3,226         |\n| POCI                             | -

Typically, a customer will arrange repayment through the acquisition of a new loan to settle the existing debt. Refinance risk is the risk that a customer, being\n\nunable to repay the debt on maturity, fails to refinance it at commercial terms. We monitor our commercial real estate portfolio closely, assessing indicators for signs of potential issues with refinancing.\n\nCommercial real estate gross loans and advances to customers maturity analysis\n\n|                |                      |                   |                                                              |                                    |                                         |                                           |                             |          | of which:   | of which:     |\n|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|\n|                | HSBC UK  Bank plc $m | HSBC  Bank plc $m | The Hongkong  and Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  Limited $m | HSBC Bank  Middle East  Limited $m | HSBC North  America  Holdings Inc. 1 $m | Grupo  Financiero  HSBC, S.A.  de C.V. $m | Other  trading  entities $m | Total $m | UK  $m      | Hong  Kong $m |\n| < 1 year       | 3,553                | 1,496             | 25,427                                                       | 396                                | 1,472                                   | 619                                       | 437                         | 33,400   | 3,950       | 19,887        |\n| 1-2 years      | 4,514                | 474               | 14,144                                                       | 175                                | 623                                     | 60                                        | 2                           | 19,992   | 4,571       | 10,923        |\n| 2-5 years      | 5,411                | 2,149             | 16,052                                                       | 441                                | 1,814                                   | 71                                        | 3                           | 25,941   | 5,520       | 9,885         |\n| > 5 years      | 532                  | 715               | 2,498                                                        | 448                                | 16                                      | 30                                        | 17                          | 4,256    | 545         | 1,767         |\n| At 31 Dec 2023 | 14,010               | 4,834             | 58,121                                                       | 1,460                              | 3,925                                   | 780                                       | 459                         | 83,589   | 14,586      | 42,462        |\n| < 1 year       | 8,315                | 2,059             | 23,468                                                       | 423                                | 1,883                                   | 241                                       | 703                         | 37,092   | 9,211       | 18,675        |\n| 1-2 years      | 3,518                | 1,503             | 18,007                                                       | 218                                | 810                                     | 115                                       | 228                         | 24,399   | 3,678       | 13,873        |\n| 2-5 years      | 2,385                | 1,644             | 21,804                                                       | 664                                | 2,624                                   | 449                                       | 60                          | 29,630   | 2,472       | 14,963        |\n| > 5 years      | 656                  | 982               | 3,071                                                        | 376                                | 28                                      | 98                                        | 63                          | 5,274    | 683         | 2,510         |\n| At 31 Dec 2022 | 14,874               | 6,188             | 66,350                                                       | 1,681                              | 5,345                                   | 903                                       | 1,054                       | 96,395   | 16,044      | 50,021        |",

The exposures in the table are related to companies whose primary activities are focused on these activities. Lending is generally focused on tier 1 and 2 cities. The table also includes financing provided to a corporate or financial entity for the purchase or financing of a property that supports the overall operations of the business. Such exposures are outside of our normal definition of commercial real estate, as applied elsewhere in this report, but are provided here for a more comprehensive view of our mainland China property exposure.\n\nThe table above shows 59% ($7.1bn) of total exposure with a credit quality of 'satisfactory' or above, which was slightly higher in proportion compared with 31 December 2022 (57%, $9.5bn). Total 'credit impaired' exposures increased to 26% ($3.2bn) (31 December 2022: 20%, $3.4bn), reflecting sustained stress in the China commercial real estate market, including weakness in both property market fundamentals and financing conditions for borrowers operating in this sector.\n\nAllowances for ECL are substantially against unsecured exposures. For secured exposures, allowances for ECL are minimal, reflecting the nature and value of the security held.\n\nFacilities booked in Hong Kong continued to represent the largest proportion of mainland China commercial real estate exposures, although total exposures reduced to $6.3bn, down $3.1bn since 31 December 2022, as a result of de-risking measures, repayments\n\nand write-offs. This portfolio remains relatively higher risk, with 33% (31 December 2022: 36%) of exposure booked with a credit quality of 'satisfactory' or above and 47% 'credit impaired' (31 December 2022: 33%).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had allowances for ECL of $1.8bn (31 December 2022: $1.7bn) held against mainland China commercial real estate exposures booked in Hong Kong. ECL coverage increased to 28.5% (31 December 2022: 18.6%), reflecting a further credit deterioration during the year.\n\nApproximately half of the unimpaired exposure in the Hong Kong portfolio is lending to state-owned enterprises and relatively strong private-owned enterprises. This is reflected in the relatively low allowance for ECL in this part of the portfolio.\n\nMarket conditions are likely to remain subdued with a protracted recovery as sentiment and domestic residential demand remain weak, with ongoing refinancing and liquidity risk for corporates operating in this market. The divergence between privately-owned enterprises and state-owned enterprises is likely to continue, with state-owned enterprises achieving above-market sales performance, and benefiting from market share gains and better access to funding.\n\nThe Group has additional exposures to mainland China commercial real estate as a result of lending to multinational corporates booked outside of mainland China, which is not incorporated in the table above.",

        "page_content": "## Collateral and other credit enhancements\n\n## (Audited)\n\nAlthough collateral can be an important mitigant of credit risk, it is the Group's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's ability to meet their obligations out of cash flow resources rather than placing primary reliance on collateral and other credit risk enhancements. Depending on the customer's standing and the type of product, facilities may be provided without any collateral or other credit enhancements. For other lending, a charge over collateral is obtained and considered in determining the credit decision and pricing. In the event of default, the Group may utilise the collateral as a source of repayment.\n\nDepending on its form, collateral can have a significant financial effect in mitigating our exposure to credit risk. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is the case for reverse repurchase agreements and for certain loans and advances to customers where the loan to value ('LTV') is very low.\n\nMitigants may include a charge on borrowers' specific assets, such as real estate or financial instruments. Other credit risk mitigants include short positions in securities and financial assets held as part of linked insurance/investment contracts where the risk is predominantly borne by the policyholder. Additionally, risk may be managed by employing other types of collateral and credit risk enhancements, such as second charges, other liens and unsupported guarantees. Guarantees are normally taken from corporates and export credit agencies. Corporates would normally provide guarantees as part of a parent/ subsidiary relationship and span a number of credit grades. The export credit agencies will normally be investment grade.\n\nCertain credit mitigants are used strategically in portfolio management activities. While single name concentrations arise in portfolios managed by Global Banking and Corporate Banking, it is only in Global Banking that their size requires the use of portfolio level credit mitigants. Across Global Banking, risk limits and utilisations, maturity profiles and risk quality are monitored and managed proactively. This process is key to the setting of risk appetite for these larger, more complex, geographically distributed customer groups. While the principal form of risk management continues to be at the point of exposure origination, through the lending decision-making process, Global Banking also utilises loan sales and credit default swap ('CDS') hedges to manage concentrations and reduce risk.\n\nThese transactions are the responsibility of a dedicated Global Banking portfolio management team. Hedging activity is carried out within agreed credit parameters, and is subject to market risk limits and a robust governance structure. Where applicable, CDSs are entered into directly with a central clearing house counterparty. Otherwise, the Group's exposure to CDS protection providers is diversified among mainly banking counterparties with strong credit ratings.\n\nCDS mitigants are held at portfolio level and are not included in the expected credit loss calculations. CDS mitigants are not reported in the following tables.\n\n## Collateral on loans and advances\n\nCollateral held is analysed separately for commercial real estate and for other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) lending. The following tables include off-balance sheet loan commitments, primarily undrawn credit lines.\n\nThe collateral measured in the following tables consists of fixed first charges on real estate, and charges over cash and marketable financial instruments. The values in the tables represent the expected market value on an open market basis. No adjustment has been made to the collateral for any expected costs of recovery. Marketable securities are measured at their fair value.\n\nOther types of collateral such as unsupported guarantees and floating charges over the assets of a customer's business are not measured in the following tables. While such mitigants have value, often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable value is not sufficiently certain and they are therefore assigned no value for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe LTV ratios presented are calculated by directly associating loans and advances with the collateral that individually and uniquely supports each facility. When collateral assets are shared by multiple loans and advances, whether specifically or, more generally, by way of an all monies charge, the collateral value is pro-rated across the loans and advances protected by the collateral.\n\nFor credit-impaired loans, the collateral values cannot be directly compared with impairment allowances recognised. The LTV figures use open market values with no adjustments. Impairment allowances are calculated on a different basis, by considering other cash flows and adjusting collateral values for costs of realising collateral as explained further on page 348.\n\n## Commercial real estate loans and advances\n\nThe value of commercial real estate collateral is determined by using a combination of external and internal valuations and physical inspections. For commercial real estate, where the facility exceeds regulatory threshold requirements, Group policy requires an independent review of the valuation at least every three years, or more frequently as the need arises.\n\nIn Hong Kong, market practice is typically for lending to major property companies to be either secured by guarantees or unsecured. In Europe, facilities of a working capital nature are generally not secured by a first fixed charge, and are therefore disclosed as not collateralised.",

For financing activities in other corporate and commercial lending, collateral value is not strongly correlated to principal repayment performance.\n\nCollateral values are generally refreshed when an obligor's general credit performance deteriorates and we have to assess the likely performance of secondary sources of repayment should it prove necessary to rely on them.\n\nWholesale lending -

        "page_content": "## Other credit risk exposures\n\nIn addition to collateralised lending, other credit enhancements are employed and methods used to mitigate credit risk arising from financial assets. These are summarised below:\n\n- -Some securities issued by governments, banks and other financial institutions benefit from additional credit enhancements provided by government guarantees that cover the assets.\n- -Debt securities issued by banks and financial institutions include asset-backed securities ('ABSs') and similar instruments, which are supported by underlying pools of financial assets. Credit risk associated with ABSs is reduced through the purchase of credit default swap ('CDS') protection.\n- -Trading loans and advances mainly pledged against cash collateral are posted to satisfy margin requirements. There is limited credit risk on cash collateral posted since in the event of default of the counterparty this would be set off against the related liability. Reverse repos and stock borrowing are by their nature collateralised.\n\nCollateral accepted as security that the Group is permitted to sell or repledge under these arrangements is described on page 390 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk includes financial guarantees and similar contracts granted, as well as loan and other credit-related commitments. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may use additional credit mitigation if a guarantee is called upon or a loan commitment is drawn and subsequently defaults.\n\nFor further information on these arrangements, see Note 33 on the financial statements.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe participate in transactions exposing us to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a transaction defaults before satisfactorily settling it. It arises principally from over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives and securities financing transactions and is calculated in both the trading and nontrading books. Transactions vary in value by reference to a market factor such as an interest rate, exchange rate or asset price.\n\nThe counterparty risk from derivative transactions is taken into account when reporting the fair value of derivative positions. The adjustment to the fair value is known as the credit valuation adjustment ('CVA').\n\nFor an analysis of CVAs, see Note 12 on the financial statements.\n\nThe following table reflects by risk type the fair values and gross notional contract amounts of derivatives cleared through an exchange, central counterparty or non-central counterparty.\n\nNotional contract amounts and fair values of derivatives\n\n|                                                                | 2023       | 2023       | 2023        | 2022 1     | 2022 1     | 2022 1      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                                                | Notional   | Fair value | Fair value  | Notional   | Fair value | Fair value  |\n|                                                                | amount     | Assets     | Liabilities | amount     | Assets     | Liabilities |\n|                                                                | $m         | $m         | $m          | $m         | $m         | $m          |\n| Total OTC derivatives                                          | 24,551,539 | 337,066    | 343,098     | 23,649,591 | 421,324    | 423,909     |\n| -  total OTC derivatives cleared by central counterparties     | 11,130,785 | 116,520    | 118,796     | 11,360,730 | 149,193    | 154,167     |\n| -  total OTC derivatives not cleared by central counterparties | 13,420,754 | 220,546    | 224,302     | 12,288,861 | 272,131    | 269,742     |\n| Total exchange traded derivatives                              | 1,111,247  | 9,134      | 8,159       | 1,146,426  | 3,822      | 2,840       |\n| Gross                                                          | 25,662,786 | 346,200    | 351,258     | 24,796,017 | 425,146    | 426,749     |\n| Offset                                                         |            | (116,486)  | (116,486)   |            | (140,987)  | (140,987)   |\n| At 31 Dec                                                      |            | 229,714    | 234,772     |            | 284,159    | 285,762     |\n\n## The purposes for which HSBC uses derivatives are described in Note 15 on the financial statements.\n\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') master agreement is our preferred agreement for documenting derivatives activity. It is common, and our preferred practice, for the parties involved in a derivative transaction to execute a credit support annex ('CSA') in conjunction with the ISDA master agreement. Under a CSA, collateral is passed between the parties to mitigate the counterparty risk inherent in outstanding positions. The majority of our CSAs are with financial institutional clients.\n\nWe manage the counterparty exposure on our OTC derivative contracts by using collateral agreements with counterparties and netting agreements. Currently, we do not actively manage our general OTC derivative counterparty exposure in the credit markets, although we may manage individual exposures in certain circumstances.\n\nWe place strict policy restrictions on collateral types and as a consequence the types of collateral received and pledged are, by value, highly liquid and of a strong quality, being predominantly cash.\n\nWhere a collateral type is required to be approved outside the collateral policy, approval is required from a committee of senior representatives from Markets, Legal and Risk.\n\nSee Note 31 on the financial statements for details regarding legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and collateral received in respect of derivatives.\n\n## Personal lending\n\nThis section presents further disclosures related to personal lending. It provides details of the major legal entities, countries and products that are driving the change observed in personal loans and advances to customers, with the impact of foreign exchange separately identified. Additionally, Hong Kong and UK mortgage book LTV data is provided.\n\nThis section also provides reconciliations of the opening 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 closing gross carrying/nominal amounts and associated allowance for ECL by product. Further product granularity is also provided by stage, with data for major legal entities presented for loans and advances to customers, loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, total personal lending for loans and advances to customers of $447.5bn increased by $32.6bn compared with 31 December 2022. This increase included favourable foreign exchange movements of $11.5bn. Excluding foreign exchange movements, the increase of $21.1bn was mainly driven by growth in the UK (up $6.6bn), in Hong Kong (up $5.8bn), in Mexico (up $2.3bn) and in Australia (up $1.4bn). Additionally, France increased by $7.8bn due to the retention of the home loan portfolio, which is no longer classified as assets held for sale.\n\nThe increase was partly offset by a $1.2bn decrease from the merger of our business in Oman and a $1.0bn decrease from the sale of our retail mortgage loan portfolio in New Zealand.",

The allowance for ECL attributable to mortgages remained broadly stable at $0.6bn when compared with 31 December 2022.\n\nTotal personal lending gross carrying amounts in stage 2 decreased by $1.4bn compared with 31 December 2022. Excluding favourable foreign exchange movements of $2.3bn, the decrease of $3.7bn was driven by favourable economic conditions and the model updates for interest-only and offset mortgages at a portfolio level in the UK.\n\nThe quality of both our Hong Kong and UK mortgage books remained strong, with low levels of impairment allowances. The average LTV ratio on new mortgage lending in Hong Kong was 64%, compared with an estimated 60% for the overall mortgage portfolio. The average LTV ratio on new lending in the UK was 65%, compared with an estimated 53% for the overall mortgage portfolio.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements and reclassifications to held for sale, other personal lending balances at 31 December 2023 increased by $7.8bn compared with 31 December 2022. This was mainly from the retained home loan portfolio in France (up $7.4bn), which is no longer classified as assets held for sale. In addition, our credit card portfolio in Mexico increased by $0.6bn.\n\nThe allowance for ECL, excluding foreign exchange movements, attributable to other personal lending of $2.3bn remained unchanged from 31 December 2022. The allowance for ECL attributable to credit cards decreased by $0.1bn, offset by adverse foreign exchange movements of $0.1bn in other personal lending.\n\n## Total personal lending for loans and advances to customers at amortised cost by stage distribution\n\n|                                                                               | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Allowance for ECL Stage 2 Stage 3 Total   | Allowance for ECL Stage 2 Stage 3 Total   | Allowance for ECL Stage 2 Stage 3 Total   | Allowance for ECL Stage 2 Stage 3 Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Stage 1 $m              | Stage 2 $m              | Stage 3 $m              | Total $m                | Stage 1 $m                                | $m                                        | $m                                        | $m                                        |\n| By portfolio                                                                  |                         |                         |                         |                         |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| First lien residential mortgages                                              | 320,410                 | 38,287                  | 2,212                   | 360,909                 | (102)                                     | (200)                                     | (269)                                     | (571)                                     |\n| -

This was partly offset by $447m relating to underlying net book volume movements and $15m in changes to models used for the calculation of ECL.\n\nDuring the period, there was a net transfer to stage 2 of $1,910m gross carrying/nominal amounts. This increase was mainly driven by $1,550m in Mexico, due to slight deterioration in the unsecured portfolio.",

The major risks faced by HSBC Holdings are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (in the form of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk).\n\nCredit risk in HSBC Holdings primarily arises from transactions with Group subsidiaries.\n\nIn HSBC Holdings, the maximum exposure to credit risk arises from two components:\n\n- -financial assets on the balance sheet, where maximum exposure equals the carrying amount (see page 338); and\n- -financial guarantees and other guarantees, where the maximum exposure is the maximum that we would have to pay if the guarantees were called upon (see Note 34).\n\nIn the case of our derivative asset balances (see page 338), there is a legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and where, as a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis under normal circumstances, they do not qualify for net presentation for accounting purposes. These offsets also include collateral received in cash and other financial assets.\n\nThe total offset relating to our derivative asset balances was $3.0bn at 31 December 2023 (2022: $3.1bn).\n\nThe credit quality of loans and advances and financial investments, both of which consist of intra-Group lending and US Treasury bills and bonds, is assessed as 'strong', with 100% of the exposure being neither past due nor impaired (2022: 100%). For further details of credit quality classification, see page 148.",

We aim to maintain a strong capital and liquidity base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting both consolidated and local regulatory requirements at all times.\n\nOur policy is underpinned by our risk management framework. The risk management framework incorporates a number of measures aligned to our assessment of risks for both internal and regulatory purposes. These risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, structural and transactional foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nFor further details, refer to our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2023 .\n\n## Treasury risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\n- -Following high-profile banking failures in the first quarter of 2023, we reviewed our liquidity monitoring and metric assumptions as part of our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process cycle to ensure they continued to cover observed and emerging risks.\n- -In 2023, we reverted to a policy of paying quarterly dividends, with the Board approving three interim dividends of $0.10 per share. We announced $7bn of share buy-backs during 2023.\n- -Effective July 2023, the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee doubled the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate from 1% to 2%, in line with the usual 12 -month implementation lag. This change increased our CET1 requirement by 0.2 percentage points.\n- -We further stabilised our net interest income against a backdrop of fluctuating interest rate expectations as the trajectory of inflation for major economies was reassessed.\n- -Following the acquisition of SVB UK in the first quarter of 2023, we launched HSBC Innovation Banking in June, which combined the expertise of SVB UK with the reach of our international network. We are in the process of integrating HSBC Innovation\n\nBanking into the Group. The acquisition was funded from existing resources, and the impacts on our Group LCR and CET1 ratio were minimal.\n\n- -In the fourth quarter of 2023, we reclassified our retail banking operations in France as held for sale, recognising a $2.0bn loss. In the first quarter, we had recognised a $2.1bn partial reversal of impairment for this business. The net result for the year was a favourable $0.1bn impact. On 1 January 2024, we completed the sale of this business with no material incremental impact on CET1.\n- -Having entered into an agreement to sell our banking business in Canada in 2022, the transaction is expected to complete at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The associated gain on sale is expected to add approximately 1.2 percentage points to the CET1 ratio as it stood at 31 December 2023.\n\nFor quantitative disclosures on capital ratios, own funds and riskweighted assets ('RWAs'), see pages 206 to 207. For quantitative disclosures on liquidity and funding metrics, see pages 210 to 211. For quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see pages 214 to 216.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Global Head of Traded and Treasury Risk Management and Risk Analytics is the accountable risk steward for all treasury risks. The Group Treasurer is the risk owner for all treasury risks, with the exception of pension risk and insurance risk. The Group Treasurer coowns pension risk with the Group Head of Performance, Reward and Employee Relations. Insurance risk is owned by the Chief Executive Officer for Global Insurance.\n\nCapital risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, structural foreign exchange risk and transactional foreign exchange risk are the responsibility of the Group Executive Committee and the Group Risk Committee ('GRC'). Global Treasury actively manages these risks on an ongoing basis, supported by the Holdings Asset and Liability Management Committee ('ALCO') and local ALCOs, overseen by Treasury Risk Management and Risk Management Meetings.\n\nPension risk is overseen by a network of local and regional pension risk management meetings. The Global Pensions Risk Management Meeting provides oversight of all pension plans sponsored by HSBC globally, and is chaired by the accountable risk steward. Insurance risk is overseen by the Global Insurance Risk Management Meeting, chaired by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer for Global Insurance.\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk management processes\n\n## Assessment and risk appetite\n\nOur capital management policy is supported by a global capital management framework. The framework sets out our approach to determining key capital risk appetites including CET1, total capital, minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL'), the leverage ratio and double leverage. Our internal capital adequacy assessment process ('ICAAP') is an assessment of the Group's capital position, outlining both regulatory and internal capital resources and requirements resulting from HSBC's business model, strategy, risk profile and management, performance and planning, risks to capital, and the implications of stress testing. Our assessment of capital adequacy is driven by an assessment of risks. These risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, insurance, structural foreign exchange, interest rate risk in the banking book and Group risk. Climate risk is also considered as part of the ICAAP, and we are continuing to develop our approach. The Group's ICAAP supports the determination of the consolidated capital risk appetite and target ratios, as well as enables the assessment and determination of capital requirements by regulators. Subsidiaries prepare ICAAPs in line with global guidance, while considering their local regulatory regimes to determine their own risk appetites and ratios.",

        "page_content": "HSBC Holdings is the provider of MREL to its subsidiaries, including equity and non-equity capital. These investments are funded by HSBC Holdings' own equity capital and MREL-eligible debt. MREL includes own funds and liabilities that can be written down or converted into capital resources in order to absorb losses or recapitalise a bank in the event of its failure. In line with our existing structure and business model, HSBC has three resolution groups - the European resolution group, the Asian resolution group and the US resolution group. There are some smaller entities that fall outside these resolution groups.\n\nHSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a prudent balance between the composition of its capital and its investments in subsidiaries.\n\nAs a matter of long-standing policy, the holding company group retains a substantial holdings capital buffer comprising cash and other high-quality liquid assets, which at 31 December 2023 was in excess of $27bn, within risk appetite.\n\nWe aim to ensure that management has oversight of our liquidity and funding risks at Group and entity level through robust governance, in line with our risk management framework. We manage liquidity and funding risk at an operating entity level in accordance with globally consistent policies, procedures and reporting standards. This ensures that obligations can be met in a timely manner, in the jurisdiction where they fall due.\n\nOperating entities are required to meet internal minimum requirements and any applicable regulatory requirements at all times. These requirements are assessed through our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ('ILAAP'), which ensures that operating entities have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons, including intra-day. The ILAAP informs the validation of risk tolerance and the setting of risk appetite. It also assesses the capability to manage liquidity and funding effectively in each major entity. These metrics are set and managed locally but are subject to robust global review and challenge to ensure consistency of approach and application of the Group's policies and controls.\n\n## Planning and performance\n\nCapital and RWA plans form part of the annual financial resource plan that is approved by the Board. Capital and RWA forecasts are submitted to the Group Executive Committee on a monthly basis, and capital and RWAs are monitored and managed against the plan. The responsibility for global capital allocation principles rests with the Group Chief Financial Officer, supported by the Group Capital Management Meeting. This is a specialist forum addressing capital management, reporting into Holdings ALCO.\n\nThrough our internal governance processes, we seek to strengthen discipline over our investment and capital allocation decisions, and to ensure that returns on investment meet management's objectives. Our strategy is to allocate capital to businesses and entities to support growth objectives where returns above internal hurdle levels have been identified and in order to meet their regulatory and economic capital needs. We evaluate and manage business returns by using a return on average tangible equity measure and a related economic profit measure.\n\nFunding and liquidity plans also form part of the financial resource plan that is approved by the Board. The Board-level appetite measures are the liquidity coverage ratio ('LCR') and net stable funding ratio ('NSFR'), together with an internal liquidity metric. In addition, we use a wider set of measures to manage an appropriate funding and liquidity profile, including legal entity depositor concentration limits, intra-day liquidity, forward-looking funding assessments and other key measures.\n\n## Risks to capital and liquidity\n\nOutside the stress testing framework, other risks may be identified that have the potential to affect our RWAs, capital and/or liquidity position. Downside and Upside scenarios are assessed against our management objectives, and mitigating actions are assigned as necessary. We closely monitor future regulatory developments and continue to evaluate the impact of these upon our capital and liquidity requirements, particularly those related to the UK's implementation of\n\nthe outstanding measures to be implemented from the Basel III reforms ('Basel 3.1').\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nFuture changes to our ratios will occur with the implementation of Basel 3.1. The Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') has published its consultation paper on the UK's implementation, with a proposed implementation date of 1 July 2025. The PRA has also published a set of near-final rules in relation to some Basel 3.1 elements. We are currently assessing the impact of implementation.\n\nThe RWA output floor under Basel 3.1 is proposed to be subject to a four-and-a-half year transitional provision. Any impact from the output floor is expected be towards the end of the transition period.\n\n## Regulatory reporting processes and controls\n\nThe quality of regulatory reporting remains a key priority for management and regulators. We are progressing with a comprehensive programme to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency and enhance controls across regulatory reports.\n\nThe ongoing programme of work focuses on our material regulatory reports and is being phased over a number of years. This programme includes data enhancement, transformation of the reporting systems and an uplift to the control environment over the report production process.\n\nWhile this programme continues, there may be further impacts on some of our regulatory ratios, such as the CET1, LCR and NSFR, as we implement recommended changes and continue to enhance our controls across the process.\n\n## Stress testing and recovery and resolution planning\n\nThe Group uses stress testing to inform management of the capital and liquidity needed to withstand internal and external shocks, including a global economic downturn or a systems failure. Stress testing results are also used to inform risk mitigation actions, input into global business performance measures through tangible equity allocation, and recovery and resolution planning, as well as to reevaluate business plans where analysis shows capital, liquidity and/or returns do not meet their target.\n\nIn addition to a range of internal stress tests, we are subject to supervisory stress testing in many jurisdictions. These include the programmes of the Bank of England ('BoE'), the US Federal Reserve Board, the European Banking Authority, the European Central Bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The results of regulatory stress testing and our internal stress tests are used when assessing our internal capital and liquidity requirements through the ICAAP and ILAAP. The outcomes of stress testing exercises carried out by the PRA and other regulators feed into the setting of regulatory minimum ratios and buffers.\n\nWe maintain recovery plans for the Group and material entities, which set out potential options management could take in a range of stress scenarios that could result in a breach of capital or liquidity buffers.\n\nThe Group recovery plan sets out the framework and governance arrangements to support restoring HSBC to a stable and viable position, and so lowering the probability of failure from either idiosyncratic company-specific stress or systemic market-wide issues. Our material entities' recovery plans provide detailed actions that management would consider taking in a stress scenario should their positions deteriorate and threaten to breach risk appetite and regulatory minimum levels. This is to help ensure that HSBC entities can stabilise their financial position and recover from financial losses in a stress environment.\n\nThe Group also has capabilities, resources and arrangements in place to address the unlikely event that HSBC might not be recoverable and would therefore need to be resolved by regulators. The Group and the BoE publicly disclosed the status of HSBC's progress against the BoE's Resolvability Assessment Framework in June 2022, following the submission of HSBC's inaugural resolvability self-assessment in October 2021. HSBC has continued to enhance its resolvability capabilities since this time and submitted its second self-assessment in October 2023. A subsequent update was provided to the BoE in January 2024.

The Group is committed to further developing its recovery and resolution capabilities, including in relation to the Resolvability Assessment Framework.\n\n## Measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book processes\n\n## Assessment and risk appetite\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the risk of an adverse impact to earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates. It is generated by our non-traded assets and liabilities, specifically loans, deposits and financial instruments that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Interest rate risk that can be economically hedged may be transferred to Global Treasury. Hedging is generally executed through interest rate derivatives or fixed-rate government bonds. Any interest rate risk that Global Treasury cannot economically hedge is not transferred and will remain within the global business where the risks originate.\n\nGlobal Treasury uses a number of measures to monitor and control interest rate risk in the banking book, including:\n\n- -net interest income sensitivity;\n- -banking net interest income sensitivity; and\n- -economic value of equity sensitivity.\n\n## Net interest income and banking net interest income sensitivity\n\nA principal part of our management of non-traded interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of expected net interest income ('NII') under varying interest rate scenarios (i.e. simulation modelling), where all other economic variables are held constant. This monitoring is undertaken at an entity and Group level, where a range of interest rate scenarios are monitored on a one-year basis.\n\nNII sensitivity figures represent the effect of pro forma movements in projected yield curves based on a static balance sheet size and structure, except for certain mortgage products where balances are impacted by interest rate sensitive prepayments. These sensitivity calculations do not incorporate actions that would be taken by Global Treasury or in the business that originates the risk to mitigate the effect of interest rate movements.\n\nThe NII sensitivity calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 'up-shock' scenario. The sensitivity calculations in the 'down-shock' scenarios reflect no floors to the shocked market rates. However, customer product-specific interest rate floors are recognised where applicable.\n\nDuring 2023, we introduced an additional metric to measure and manage the sensitivity of our NII to interest rate shocks. In addition to NII sensitivity, we now also monitor banking NII sensitivity. HSBC has a significant quantity of trading book assets that are funded by banking book liabilities, and the NII sensitivity measure does not include the sensitivity of the internal transfer income from this funding. Banking NII sensitivity includes an adjustment on top of NII sensitivity to reflect this. Going forwards, this will be our primary metric for monitoring and management of interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\n## Economic value of equity sensitivity\n\nEconomic value of equity ('EVE') represents the present value of the future banking book cash flows that could be distributed to equity holders under a managed run-off scenario. This equates to the current book value of equity plus the present value of future NII in this scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the expected movement in EVE due to pre-specified interest rate shocks, where all other economic variables are held constant. Operating entities are required to monitor EVE sensitivities as a percentage of capital resources.\n\nFurther details of HSBC's risk management of interest rate risk in the banking book can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2023 .\n\n## Other Group risks\n\n## Non-trading book foreign exchange exposures\n\n## Structural foreign exchange exposures\n\nStructural foreign exchange exposures arise from net assets or capital investments in foreign operations, together with any associated hedging. A foreign operation is defined as a subsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch where the activities are conducted in a currency other than that of the reporting entity. An entity's functional reporting currency is normally that of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.\n\nExchange differences on structural exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income ('OCI'). We use the US dollar as our presentation currency in our consolidated financial statements because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which we transact and fund our business. Therefore, our consolidated balance sheet is affected by exchange differences between the US dollar and all the non-US dollar functional currencies of underlying foreign operations.\n\nOur structural foreign exchange exposures are managed with the primary objective of ensuring, where practical, that our consolidated capital ratios and the capital ratios of individual banking subsidiaries are largely protected from the effect of changes in exchange rates. We hedge structural foreign exchange positions where it is capital efficient to do so, and subject to approved limits. This is achieved through a combination of net investment hedges and economic hedges. Hedging positions are monitored and rebalanced periodically to manage RWA or downside risks associated with HSBC's foreign currency investments.\n\nFor further details of our structural foreign exchange exposures, see page 213.\n\n## Transactional foreign exchange exposures\n\nTransactional foreign exchange risk arises primarily from day-to-day transactions in the banking book generating profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') reserves in a currency other than the reporting currency of the operating entity. Transactional foreign exchange exposure generated through profit and loss is periodically transferred to Markets and Securities Services and managed within limits, with the exception of limited residual foreign exchange exposure arising from timing differences or for other reasons. Transactional foreign exchange exposure generated through OCI reserves is managed by Global Treasury within approved appetite.\n\n## HSBC Holdings risk management\n\nAs a financial services holding company, HSBC Holdings has limited market risk activities. Its activities predominantly involve maintaining sufficient capital resources to support the Group's diverse activities; allocating these capital resources across the Group's businesses; earning dividend and interest income on its investments in the businesses; payment of operating expenses; providing dividend payments to its equity shareholders and interest payments to providers of debt capital; and maintaining a supply of short-term liquid assets for deployment under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe main market risks to which HSBC Holdings is exposed are banking book interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Exposure to these risks arises from short-term cash balances, funding positions held, loans to subsidiaries, investments in long-term financial assets, financial liabilities including debt capital issued, and structural foreign exchange hedges. The objective of HSBC Holdings' market risk management strategy is to manage volatility in capital resources, cash flows and distributable reserves that could be caused by movements in market parameters. Market risk for HSBC Holdings is monitored by Holdings ALCO in accordance with its risk appetite statement.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\nHSBC Holdings uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency risk arising from its long-term debt issues. It also uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its structural foreign exchange exposures.\n\nFor quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see pages 214 to 216.\n\n## Pension risk management processes\n\nOur global pensions strategy is to move from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, where local law allows and it is considered competitive to do so. Our most material defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants for many years, and the majority (including the largest plan in the UK) are also closed to future accrual.\n\nIn defined contribution pension plans, the contributions that HSBC is required to make are known, while the ultimate pension benefit will vary, typically with investment returns achieved by investment choices made by the employee. While the market risk to HSBC of defined contribution plans is low, the Group is still exposed to operational and reputational risk.\n\nIn defined benefit pension plans, the level of pension benefit is known. Therefore, the level of contributions required by HSBC will vary due to a number of risks, including:\n\n- -investments delivering a return below the level required to provide the projected plan benefits;\n- -the prevailing economic environment leading to corporate failures, thus triggering write-downs in asset values (both equity and debt);\n- -a change in either interest rates or inflation expectations, causing an increase in the value of plan liabilities; and\n- -plan members living longer than expected (known as longevity risk).\n\n## Capital risk in 2023\n\n## Capital overview\n\nCapital adequacy metrics\n\n|                                            | At          | At          |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                            | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |\n| Risk-weighted assets ('RWAs') ($bn)        |             |             |\n| Credit risk                                | 683.9       | 679.1       |\n| Counterparty credit risk                   | 35.5        | 37.1        |\n| Market risk                                | 37.5        | 37.6        |\n| Operational risk                           | 97.2        | 85.9        |\n| Total RWAs                                 | 854.1       | 839.7       |\n| Capital on a transitional basis ($bn)      |             |             |\n| Common equity tier 1 ('CET1') capital      | 126.5       | 119.3       |\n| Tier 1 capital                             | 144.2       | 139.1       |\n| Total capital                              | 171.2       | 162.4       |\n| Capital ratios on a transitional basis (%) |             |             |\n| Common equity tier 1 ratio                 | 14.8        | 14.2        |\n| Tier 1 ratio                               | 16.9        | 16.6        |\n| Total capital ratio                        | 20.0        | 19.3        |\n| Capital on an end point basis ($bn)        |             |             |\n| Common equity tier 1 ('CET1') capital      | 126.5       | 119.3       |\n| Tier 1 capital                             | 144.2       | 139.1       |\n| Total capital                              | 167.1       | 157.2       |\n| Capital ratios on an end point basis (%)   |             |             |\n| Common equity tier 1 ratio                 | 14.8        | 14.2        |\n| Tier 1 ratio                               | 16.9        | 16.6        |\n| Total capital ratio                        | 19.6        | 18.7        |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio ('LCR')           |             |             |\n| Total high-quality liquid assets ($bn)     | 647.5       | 647.0       |\n| Total net cash outflow ($bn)               | 477.1       | 490.8       |\n| LCR (%)                                    | 136         | 132         |\n| Net stable funding ratio ('NSFR')          |             |             |\n| Total available stable funding ($bn)       | 1,601.9     | 1,552.0     |\n| Total required stable funding ($bn)        | 1,202.4     | 1,138.4     |\n| NSFR (%)                                   | 133         | 136         |\n\nPension risk is assessed using an economic capital model that takes into account potential variations in these factors. The impact of these variations on both pension assets and pension liabilities is assessed using a one-in-200-year stress test. Scenario analysis and other stress tests are also used to support pension risk management, including the review of de-risking opportunities.\n\nTo fund the benefits associated with defined benefit plans, sponsoring Group companies, and in some instances employees, make regular contributions in accordance with advice from actuaries and in consultation with the plan's fiduciaries where relevant. These contributions are normally set to ensure that there are sufficient funds to meet the cost of the accruing benefits for the future service of active members. However, higher contributions are required when plan assets are considered insufficient to cover the existing pension liabilities. Contribution rates are typically revised annually or once every three years, depending on the plan.\n\nThe defined benefit plans invest contributions in a range of investments designed to limit the risk of assets failing to meet a plan's liabilities. Any changes in expected returns from the investments may also change future contribution requirements. In pursuit of these long-term objectives, an overall target allocation is established between asset classes of the defined benefit plan. In addition, each permitted asset class has its own benchmarks, such as stock-market or property valuation indices or liability characteristics. The benchmarks are reviewed at least once every three to five years and more frequently if required by local legislation or circumstances. The process generally involves an extensive asset and liability review.\n\nIn addition, some of the Group's pension plans hold longevity swap contracts. These arrangements provide long-term protection to the relevant plans against costs resulting from pensioners or their dependants living longer than initially expected. The most sizeable plan to do this is the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme, which holds longevity swaps covering approximately 50% of the plan's pensioner liabilities.",

The key drivers of the overall rise in our CET1 ratio during the year were:\n\n- -a 1.0 percentage point increase from capital generation, mainly through profits less dividends and share buy-backs;\n- -a 0.3 percentage point reduction due to an increase in regulatory deductions, primarily for expected excess loss and intangible assets; and\n- -a 0.1 percentage point decrease from the adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the increase in the underlying RWAs.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nRWAs by global business\n\n|                          |   WPB $bn |   CMB 1 $bn |   GBM 1 $bn | Corporate  Centre $bn   |   Total RWAs $bn |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Credit risk              |     155.3 |       319.1 |       131.5 | 78.0                    |            683.9 |\n| Counterparty credit risk |       1.9 |         1.5 |        32   | 0.1                     |             35.5 |\n| Market risk              |       1.3 |         1   |        22.2 | 13.0                    |             37.5 |\n| Operational risk         |      34.4 |        32.9 |        32.8 | (2.9)                   |             97.2 |\n| At 31 Dec 2023           |     192.9 |       354.5 |       218.5 | 88.2                    |            854.1 |\n| At 31 Dec 2022           |     182.9 |       342.4 |       225.9 | 88.5                    |            839.7 |\n\nThe impairment of BoCom had an insignificant impact on our capital and CET1 ratio. This is because the impairment charge had a partially offsetting reduction in threshold deductions from regulatory capital. For regulatory capital purposes, our share of BoCom's profits is not capital accretive, although the dividends we receive from BoCom are capital accretive.\n\nOur Pillar 2A requirement at 31 December 2023, as per the PRA's Individual Capital Requirement based on a point-in-time assessment, was equivalent to 2.6% of RWAs, of which 1.5% was required to be met by CET1. Throughout 2023, we complied with the PRA's regulatory capital adequacy requirements.",

        "page_content": "Risk-weighted assets ('RWAs') rose by $14.4bn during the year, driven by an increase of $34.4bn from increased lending, higher operational risk RWAs, business acquisitions and foreign exchange movements. These were partly offset by a reduction of $19.9bn due to methodology and policy changes.\n\n## Asset size\n\nAsset size RWAs increased by $26.2bn, including a $10.4bn rise in operational risk RWAs driven by growth in NII.\n\nWPB RWAs increased by $15.6bn, notably due to an expansion of retail lending in Asia, the UK and Mexico, additional sovereign exposures in Asia and other trading entities, including a $2.9bn rise in operational risk RWAs.\n\nCMB RWAs increased by $3.2bn, reflecting an increase in operational risk RWAs of $5.2bn and additional sovereign exposures across various entities. This was partly offset by a net decrease in corporate lending in Asia, the US and Europe.\n\nGBM RWAs increased by $3.2bn, mainly from the $4.0bn rise in operational risk RWAs and additional sovereign exposures across various entities. This was partly offset by a fall in lending in Asia and Europe.\n\nCorporate Centre RWAs rose by $2.6bn, primarily due to an increase in corporate exposures in Saudi Awwal Bank ('SAB').\n\n## Asset quality\n\nAsset quality contributed to an RWA increase of $2.5bn due to credit risk rating migrations and portfolio mix changes, notably in Asia, the US and Europe.\n\n## Model updates\n\nModel updates decreased RWAs by $2.6bn, mainly due to a change in our risk approach to multilateral development banks' exposures, following approval for change from the PRA, the implementation of the exposure at default mortgage model in the UK, and changes to the incremental risk charge model.\n\n## Methodology and policy\n\nThe decrease of RWAs from methodology and policy of $19.9bn was mainly driven by a decline of $7.7bn from regulatory changes related to the risk-weighting of residential mortgages in Hong Kong, and credit risk parameter refinements mainly in Asia and Europe.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals\n\nThe increase in RWAs from acquisitions and disposals of $6.2bn was primarily due to a rise of $9.6bn from the acquisition of SVB UK. This was partly offset by a decline of $3.2bn from the disposal of our business in Oman.\n\nForeign currency movements increased total RWAs by $2.0bn.\n\n## Leverage ratio 1\n\n|                               | At              | At              |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                               | 31 Dec 2023 $bn | 31 Dec 2022 $bn |\n| Tier 1 capital (leverage)     | 144.2           | 139.1           |\n| Total leverage ratio exposure | 2,574.8         | 2,417.2         |\n|                               | %               | %               |\n| Leverage ratio                | 5.6             | 5.8             |\n\nOur leverage ratio was 5.6% at 31 December 2023, down from 5.8% at 31 December 2022. The increase in the leverage exposure was primarily due to growth in the balance sheet, which led to a fall of 0.4 percentage points in the leverage ratio. This was partly offset by a rise of 0.2 percentage points due to an increase in tier 1 capital.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, our UK minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% was supplemented by a leverage ratio buffer of 0.9%, which consists of an additional leverage ratio buffer of 0.7% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer of 0.2%. These buffers translated into capital values of $18.0bn and $5.1bn respectively.\n\n## Regulatory and other developments\n\nIn September 2023, the PRA announced changes to the UK implementation of Basel 3.1 with a new proposed implementation date of 1 July 2025. For further details related to the November 2022 consultation, see page 6 of our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2022 . We are currently assessing the impact of the consultation paper and the associated implementation challenges (including data provision) on our RWAs upon initial implementation. The RWA output floor under Basel 3.1 is now proposed to be subject to a four-and-ahalf year transitional provision. Any impact from the output floor is expected to be towards the end of the transition period.\n\n## Regulatory transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'\n\nWe have adopted the regulatory transitional arrangements of the Capital Requirements Regulation for IFRS 9, including paragraph four of article 473a. These allow banks to add back to their capital base a proportion of the impact that IFRS 9 has upon their loan loss allowances. Our capital and ratios are presented under these arrangements throughout the tables in this section, including the end point figures.\n\n## Pillar 3 disclosure requirements\n\nPillar 3 of the Basel regulatory framework is related to market discipline and aims to make financial services firms more transparent by requiring publication of wide-ranging information on their risks, capital and management.\n\nFor further details, see our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2023 , which is expected to be published on or around 21 February 2024 at www.hsbc.com/investors.",

In practice, all the principal operating entities are required to manage liquidity and funding risk on a stand-alone basis.\n\nThe tables analyse our consolidated balance sheet according to the assets that primarily arise from operating activities and the sources of funding primarily supporting these activities. Assets and liabilities that do not arise from operating activities are presented at a net balancing source or deployment of funds.\n\n## Funding sources\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                 | 2023 $m   | 2022 1 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Customer accounts                               | 1,611,647 | 1,570,303   |\n| Deposits by banks                               | 73,163    | 66,722      |\n| Repurchase agreements - non-trading             | 172,100   | 127,747     |\n| Debt securities in issue                        | 93,917    | 78,149      |\n| Cash collateral, margin and settlement accounts | 85,255    | 88,476      |\n| Liabilities of disposal groups held for sale 2  | 108,406   | 114,597     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                        | 24,954    | 22,290      |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value  | 141,426   | 127,321     |\n| Insurance contract liabilities                  | 120,851   | 108,816     |\n| Trading liabilities                             | 73,150    | 72,353      |\n| -  repos                                        | 12,198    | 16,254      |\n| -  stock lending                                | 3,322     | 3,541       |\n| -  other trading liabilities                    | 57,630    | 52,558      |\n| Total equity                                    | 192,610   | 185,197     |\n| Other balance sheet liabilities                 | 341,198   | 387,315     |\n| At 31 Dec                                       | 3,038,677 | 2,949,286   |\n\n## Funding uses\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                 | 2023 $m   | 2022 1 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Loans and advances to customers                 | 938,535   | 923,561     |\n| Loans and advances to banks                     | 112,902   | 104,475     |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements - non-trading     | 252,217   | 253,754     |\n| Cash collateral, margin and settlement accounts | 89,911    | 82,984      |\n| Assets held for sale 2                          | 114,134   | 115,919     |\n| Trading assets                                  | 289,159   | 218,093     |\n| -  reverse repos                                | 16,575    | 14,798      |\n| -  stock borrowing                              | 14,609    | 10,706      |\n| -  other trading assets                         | 257,975   | 192,589     |\n| Financial investments                           | 442,763   | 364,726     |\n| Cash and balances with central banks            | 285,868   | 327,002     |\n| Other balance sheet assets                      | 513,188   | 558,772     |\n| At 31 Dec                                       | 3,038,677 | 2,949,286   |\n\n- 2  'Liabilities of disposal groups held for sale' includes $82bn and 'Assets held for sale' includes $88bn in respect of the planned sale of our banking business in Canada.

        "page_content": "## Interest rate risk in the banking book in 2023\n\n## Net interest income and banking net interest income\n\nWe have introduced a new metric to analyse sensitivity of our income to interest rate shocks. In addition to NII sensitivity, we are also disclosing banking NII sensitivity. HSBC has trading book assets that are funded by banking book liabilities and the NII sensitivity measure does not include the sensitivity of the internal transfer income from this funding. Banking NII sensitivity includes an adjustment on top of NII sensitivity to reflect this. The currency split of banking NII sensitivities includes the impact of vanilla foreign exchange swaps to optimise cash management across the Group.\n\nIn this disclosure we present the banking NII sensitivity alongside the NII sensitivity. Over time we expect to phase out NII sensitivity once the appropriate prior period comparables are available for banking NII sensitivity.\n\nThe following tables set out the assessed impact to a hypothetical base case projection of our NII and banking NII under an immediate shock of 100bps to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2024 (effects in the first, second and third years). For example, Year 3 shows the impact of an immediate rate shock on the NII and banking NII projected for the third year.\n\nThe sensitivities shown represent a hypothetical simulation of the base case income, assuming a static balance sheet (specifically no assumed migration from current account to term deposits), and no management actions from Global Treasury. This also incorporates the effect of interest rate behaviouralisation, hypothetical managed rate product pricing assumptions, prepayment of mortgages and deposit stability. The sensitivity calculations exclude pensions, insurance, and interests in associates.\n\nsensitivity\n\nThe sensitivity analysis performed in the case of a down-shock does not include floors to market rates, and it does not include floors on some wholesale assets and liabilities. However, floors have been maintained for deposits and loans to customers where this is contractual or where negative rates would not be applied.\n\nAs market and policy rates move, the degree to which these changes are passed on to customers will vary based on a number of factors, including the absolute level of market rates, regulatory and contractual frameworks, and competitive dynamics. To aid comparability between markets, we have simplified the basis of preparation for our disclosure and have used a 50% pass-on assumption for major entities on certain interest-bearing deposits. Our pass-through asset assumptions are largely in line with our contractual agreements or established market practice, which typically results in a significant portion of interest rate changes being passed on.\n\nAn immediate interest rate rise of 100bps would increase projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2024 by $1.1bn and banking NII by $2.8bn. An immediate interest rate fall of 100bps would decrease projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2024 by $1.6bn and banking NII by $3.4bn.\n\nThe sensitivity of NII for 12 months as at 31 December 2023 decreased by $2.5bn in the plus 100bps parallel shock and by $2.4bn in the minus 100bps parallel shock, when compared with 31 December 2022. The key drivers of the reduction in NII sensitivity are the increase in stabilisation activities in line with our strategy, as well as deposit migration.\n\nFor further details of measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book, see page 205.\n\n## NII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (12 months) - Year 1 sensitivity by currency\n\n|                                                                             | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   |          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                                                             | $ $m       | HK$ $m     | \u00a3 $m       | \u20ac $m       | Other $m   | Total $m |\n| Change in Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2023) |            |            |            |            |            |          |\n| +100bps parallel                                                            | (1,155)    | 148        | 325        | 503        | 1,232      | 1,053    |\n| -100bps parallel                                                            | 1,004      | (230)      | (432)      | (522)      | (1,391)    | (1,571)  |\n| Change in Jan 2023 to Dec 2023 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2022) |            |            |            |            |            |          |\n| +100bps parallel                                                            | (267)      | 413        | 1,026      | 674        | 1,689      | 3,535    |\n| -100bps parallel                                                            | 236        | (476)      | (1,177)    | (765)      | (1,787)    | (3,969)  |\n\nNII sensitivity to an instantaneous down 100bps parallel change in yield curves - Year 2 and Year 3 sensitivity by currency\n\n|                                                            | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   |          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                                            | $ $m       | HK$ $m     | \u00a3 $m       | \u20ac $m       | Other $m   | Total $m |\n| Change in NII (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2023) |            |            |            |            |            |          |\n| Year 2 (Jan 2025 to Dec 2025)                              | 488        | (431)      | (768)      | (552)      | (1,733)    | (2,996)  |\n| Year 3 (Jan 2026 to Dec 2026)                              | 213        | (499)      | (1,269)    | (624)      | (1,861)    | (4,040)  |\n| Change in NII (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2022) |            |            |            |            |            |          |\n| Year 2 (Jan 2024 to Dec 2024)                              | (43)       | (532)      | (1,580)    | (810)      | (1,979)    | (4,944)  |\n| Year 3 (Jan 2025 to Dec 2025)                              | (404)      | (636)      | (1,954)    | (839)      | (2,092)    | (5,925)  |\n\nBanking NII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (12 months) - Year 1 sensitivity by currency\n\n|                                                                             | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   | Currency   |          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                                                             | $ $m       | HK$ $m     | \u00a3 $m       | \u20ac $m       | Other $m   | Total $m |\n| Change in Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2023) |            |            |            |            |            |          |\n| +100bps parallel                                                            | 343        | 411        | 496        | 285        | 1,297      | 2,832    |\n| -100bps parallel                                                            | (494)      | (493)      | (602)      | (304)      | (1,460)    | (3,353)  |",

The use of VaR is integrated into the market risk management of nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk, complementing risk sensitivity analysis.\n\nOur models are predominantly based on historical simulation that incorporates the following features:\n\n- -historical market rates and prices, which are calculated with reference to interest rates, credit spreads and the associated volatilities;\n- -potential market movements that are calculated with reference to data from the past two years; and\n- -calculations to a 99% confidence level and using a one-day holding period.\n\nAlthough a valuable guide to risk, VaR is used for non-trading portfolios with awareness of its limitations. For example:\n\n- -The use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future market moves may not encompass all potential market events, particularly those that are extreme in nature. As the model is calibrated on the last 500 business days, it does not adjust instantaneously to a change in the market regime.\n- -The use of a one-day holding period for risk management purposes of non-trading books is only an indication of exposure and not indicative of the time period required to hedge or liquidate positions.\n- -The use of a 99% confidence level by definition does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence.\n\nThe interest rate risk on the fixed-rate securities issued by HSBC Holdings is not included in the Group non-trading VaR. The management of this risk is described on page 217.\n\nNon-trading VaR also excludes the equity risk on securities held at fair value and non-trading book foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe daily levels of total non-trading VaR in 2023 are set out in the graph below.\n\n## Daily VaR (non-trading portfolios), 99% 1 day ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group non-trading VaR for 2023 is shown in the table below.\n\n## Non-trading VaR, 99% 1 day\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                        |   Interest rate $m |   Credit spread $m | Portfolio diversification 1 $m   |   Total 2 $m |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Balance at 31 Dec 2023 |              173.8 |              112.8 | (104.2)                          |        182.4 |\n| Average                |              156.2 |               84.2 | (63.7)                           |        176.6 |\n| Maximum                |              201.9 |              116.4 |                                  |        224.3 |\n| Minimum                |              108.8 |               55.2 |                                  |        127   |",

The portfolio represents the vast majority of our hold-to-collect-and-sell capital risk and is risk managed with a variety of tools, including risk sensitivities and value at risk measures.\n\nThe table below measures the sensitivity of the value of this portfolio to an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, based on the risk sensitivity of a shift in value for a 1 basis point ('bps') parallel movement in interest rates.\n\nSensitivity of hold-to-collect-and-sell reserves to interest rate movements\n\n|                                                    | $m      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (2,264) |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (1.22)% |\n| At 31 Dec 2022                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (1,199) |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (0.64)% |\n\nThe increase in the sensitivity of the portfolio during 2023 was mainly driven by an increase in NII stabilisation in line with our strategy. The figures in the table above do not take into account the effects of interest rate convexity. The portfolio mostly comprises vanilla sovereign bonds in a variety of currencies, and the primary risk is interest rate duration risk, although the portfolio also generates asset swap, credit spread and asset spread risks that are managed within appetite as part of our risk management framework. A minus 100bps shock would lead to an approximately symmetrical gain.\n\nAlongside our monitoring of the hold-to-collect-and-sell reserve sensitivity, we also monitor the sensitivity of reported cash flow hedging reserves to interest rate movements on a yearly basis by assessing the expected reduction in valuation of cash flow hedges due to parallel movements of plus or minus 100bps in all yield curves.\n\nThe following table describes the sensitivity of our cash flow hedging reserves to the stipulated movements in yield curves at the\n\nyear end. The sensitivities are indicative and based on simplified scenarios. These particular exposures form only a part of our overall interest rate exposure. We apply flooring on negative rates in the minus 100bps scenario in this assessment. Due to increases in interest rates in most markets, the effect of this flooring is immaterial at the end of 2023.\n\nComparing 31 December 2023 with 31 December 2022, the sensitivity of the cash flow hedging reserve increased by $1,537m in the plus 100bps scenario and increased by $1,562m in the minus 100bps scenario. The increase in the sensitivity of this reserve was mainly driven by an increase in our NII stabilisation. Our exposure to fixed rate pound sterling hedges continued to be the largest in size and in terms of year-on-year increase. Hong Kong dollar and euro hedges contributed to the majority of the rest of the increase in exposure, partly offset by a reduction in the size of US dollar hedges.\n\nSensitivity of cash flow hedging reported reserves to interest rate movements\n\n|                                                    | $m      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (3,436) |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (1.85)% |\n| -100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | 3,474   |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | 1.87%   |\n| At 31 Dec 2022                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (1,899) |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (1.01)% |\n| -100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | 1,912   |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | 1.02%   |",

        "page_content": "## Third-party assets in Markets Treasury\n\nThird-party assets in Markets Treasury increased by 5% compared with 31 December 2022. The net increase of $38bn is partly reflective of higher commercial surpluses during the year, with the\n\nincrease of $76bn in 'Financial Investments' and the decrease of $39bn in 'Cash and balances at central banks' largely driven by NII stabilisation activity.\n\n## Third-party assets in Markets Treasury\n\n|                                    | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and balances at central banks | 278,289   | 317,479   |\n| Trading assets                     | 238       | 498       |\n| Loans and advances:                |           |           |\n| -  to banks                        | 78,667    | 67,612    |\n| -  to customers                    | 1,083     | 2,102     |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements      | 45,419    | 53,016    |\n| Financial investments              | 396,259   | 319,852   |\n| Other                              | 34,651    | 36,192    |\n| At 31 Dec                          | 834,606   | 796,751   |\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nMarket risk arises within our defined benefit pension plans to the extent that the obligations of the plans are not fully matched by assets with determinable cash flows.\n\nFor details of our defined benefit plans, including asset allocation, see Note 5 on the financial statements, and for pension risk management, see page 206.\n\n## Additional market risk measures applicable only to the parent company\n\nHSBC Holdings monitors and manages foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. In order to manage interest rate risk, HSBC Holdings uses the projected sensitivity of its NII to future changes in yield curves.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nHSBC Holdings' foreign exchange exposures derive almost entirely from the execution of structural foreign exchange hedges on behalf of the Group. At 31 December 2023, HSBC Holdings had forward foreign exchange contracts of $33.8bn (2022: $30.1bn) to manage the Group's structural foreign exchange exposures.\n\nFor further details of our structural foreign exchange exposures, see page 213.\n\n## Sensitivity of net interest income\n\nHSBC Holdings monitors NII sensitivity in the first, second and third years, reflecting the longer-term perspective on interest rate risk management appropriate to a financial services holding company. These sensitivities assume that any issuance where HSBC Holdings has an option to redeem at a future call date is called at this date.\n\nThe tables below set out the effect on HSBC Holdings' future NII of an immediate shock of +/-100bps to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2024.\n\nThe NII sensitivities shown are indicative and based on simplified scenarios. An immediate interest rate rise of 100bps would decrease projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2024 by $233m. Conversely, an immediate fall of 100bps would increase projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2024 $233m.\n\nOverall the NII sensitivity is mainly driven by floating liabilities funding equity (non-interest bearing) investments in subsidiaries.\n\nDuring 2023, HSBC Holdings hedged $3.6bn of previously unhedged issuances, which increased the negative NII sensitivity to positive parallel shifts in interest rates. In year 1, that impact is offset by a shorter repricing profile of assets.\n\nAs of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 , HSBC Holdings is no longer disclosing the interest rate repricing gap table, as the sensitivity of net interest income table captures HSBC Holdings' exposure to interest rate risk and is aligned to the way we disclose interest rate risk internally to key management.\n\n## NII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (12 months) - Year 1 sensitivity by currency\n\n|                                                                             | $ $m   | HK$ $m   | \u00a3 $m   | \u20ac $m   | Other $m   | Total $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Change in Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2023) |        |          |        |        |            |            |\n| +100bps parallel                                                            | (258)  | -        | 12     | 5      | 8          | (233)      |\n| -100bps parallel                                                            | 258    | -        | (12)   | (5)    | (8)        | 233        |\n| Change in Jan 2023 to Dec 2023 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2022) |        |          |        |        |            |            |\n| +100bps parallel                                                            | (265)  | -        | 16     | 9      | -          | (240)      |\n| -100bps parallel                                                            | 265    | -        | (16)   | (9)    | -          | 240        |\n\nNII sensitivity to an instantaneous down 100bps parallel change in yield curves - Year 2 and Year 3 sensitivity by currency\n\n|                                                            | $ $m   | HK$ $m   | \u00a3 $m   | \u20ac $m   | Other $m   | Total $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Change in NII (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2023) |        |          |        |        |            |            |\n| Year 2 (Jan 2025 to Dec 2025)                              | 219    | -        | (12)   | 1      | (9)        | 199        |\n| Year 3 (Jan 2026 to Dec 2026)                              | 218    | -        | (12)   | -      | (10)       | 196        |\n| Change in NII (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2022) |        |          |        |        | -          |            |\n| Year 2 (Jan 2024 to Dec 2024)                              | 182    | -        | (12)   | (8)    | -          | 162        |\n| Year 3 (Jan 2025 to Dec 2025)                              | 160    | -        | (10)   | (7)    | -          | 143        |\n\nThe figures represent hypothetical movements in NII based on our projected yield curve scenarios, HSBC Holdings' current interest rate risk profile and assumed changes to that profile during the next three years.

Market risk arises from both trading portfolios and non-trading portfolios.\n\nFor further details of market risk in non-trading portfolios, see page 215 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 .\n\n## Market risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nThere were no material changes to our policies and practices for the management of market risk in 2023.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe following diagram summarises the main business areas where trading market risks reside and the market risk measures used to monitor and limit exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe objective of our risk management policies and measurement techniques is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimise return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite.\n\nMarket risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer for HSBC Holdings. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the Group's legal entities. Each major operating entity has an independent market risk management and control sub-function, which is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting market risk exposures against limits on a daily basis. Each operating entity is required to assess the market risks arising in its business and to transfer them either to its local Markets and Securities Services or Markets Treasury unit for management, or to separate books managed under the supervision of the local ALCO. The Traded Risk function enforces the controls around trading in permissible instruments approved for each site as well as changes that follow completion of the new product approval process. Traded Risk also restricts trading in the more complex derivative products to only those offices with appropriate levels of product expertise and control systems.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## Monitoring and limiting market risk exposures\n\nOur objective is to manage and control market risk exposures while maintaining a market profile consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nWe use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures including sensitivity analysis, VaR and stress testing.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis measures the impact of movements in individual market factors on specific instruments or portfolios, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We use sensitivity measures to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Granular sensitivity limits are set for trading desks with consideration of market liquidity, customer demand and capital constraints, among other factors.\n\n## Value at risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nVaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalise them. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarised in the 'Stress testing' section below.\n\nOur models are predominantly based on historical simulation that incorporates the following features:\n\n- -historical market rates and prices, which are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and the associated volatilities;\n- -potential market movements that are calculated with reference to data from the past two years; and\n- -calculations to a 99% confidence level and using a one-day holding period.\n\nThe models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions.\n\n## VaR model limitations\n\nAlthough a valuable guide to risk, VaR is used with awareness of its limitations. For example:\n\n- -The use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future market moves may not encompass all potential market events, particularly those that are extreme in nature. As the model is calibrated on the last 500 business days, it does not adjust instantaneously to a change in the market regime.\n- -The use of a one-day holding period for risk management purposes of trading books assumes that this short period is sufficient to hedge or liquidate all positions.\n- -The use of a 99% confidence level by definition does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence.\n- -VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not reflect intra-day exposures.\n\n## Risk not in VaR framework\n\nThe risks not in VaR ('RNIV') framework captures and capitalises material market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR model.\n\nRisk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and are either incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or quantified through either the VaR-based RNIV approach or a stress test approach within the RNIV framework. While VaR-based RNIVs are calculated by using historical scenarios, stress-type RNIVs are estimated on the basis of stress scenarios whose severity is calibrated to be in line with the capital adequacy requirements. The outcome of the VaR-based RNIV approach is included in the overall VaR calculation but excluded from the VaR measure used for regulatory back-testing.\n\nStress-type RNIVs include a deal contingent derivatives capital charge to capture risk for these transactions and a de-peg risk measure to capture risk to pegged and heavily managed currencies.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by VaR modelling. Stress testing and reverse stress testing provide senior management with insights regarding the 'tail risk' beyond VaR.\n\nStress testing is implemented at legal entity, regional and overall Group levels. A set of scenarios is used consistently across all regions within the Group. Market risk stress testing incorporates both historical and hypothetical events. Market risk reverse stress tests are designed to identify vulnerabilities in our portfolios by looking for scenarios that lead to loss levels considered severe for the relevant portfolio. These scenarios may be local or idiosyncratic in nature and complement the systematic top-down stress testing.\n\nThe risk appetite around potential stress losses for the Group is set and monitored against limits.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\nTrading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and market-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to hedge risks resulting from such positions.\n\n## Back-testing\n\nWe routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing the VaR metric against both actual and hypothetical profit and loss. Hypothetical profit and loss excludes non-modelled items such as fees, commissions and revenue of intra-day transactions.\n\nThe hypothetical profit and loss reflects the profit and loss that would be realised if positions were held constant from the end of one trading day to the end of the next. This measure of profit and loss does not align with how risk is dynamically hedged, and is not therefore necessarily indicative of the actual performance of the business.\n\nThe number of hypothetical loss back-testing exceptions, together with a number of other indicators, is used to assess model performance and to consider whether enhanced internal monitoring of a VaR model is required. We back-test our VaR at set levels of our Group entity hierarchy.\n\n## Market risk in 2023\n\nDuring 2023, global financial markets were mainly driven by the inflation outlook, interest rate expectations and recession risks, coupled with banking failures in March, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East from October. Major central banks maintained restrictive monetary policies, and bond markets experienced a volatile year. After rising significantly in the second and third quarters of 2023, US treasury bond yields fell during the fourth quarter, as lower inflation pressures led markets to expect that key rates would be cut in 2024. The interest rate outlook was also a major driver of performance in global equity markets, alongside resilient corporate earnings and positive sentiment in the technology sector. Equities in developed markets advanced significantly amid low volatility, while performance in emerging markets was more subdued. In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar fluctuated against other major currencies, mostly in line with US Federal Reserve policy and bond yields expectations. Investor sentiment remained resilient in credit markets. High-yield and investment-grade credit spreads narrowed, in general, as fears of contagion in the banking sector in the first quarter of 2023 abated, and economic growth remained resilient throughout the year.\n\nWe continued to manage market risk prudently during 2023. Sensitivity exposures and VaR remained within appetite as the business pursued its core market-making activity in support of our customers. Market risk was managed using a complementary set of risk measures and limits, including stress testing and scenario analysis.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\n## Value at risk of the trading portfolios\n\nTrading VaR was predominantly generated by the Markets and Securities Services business.\n\nTrading VaR as at 31 December 2023 increased by $3.3m compared with 31 December 2022. Interest rate risk factors were the major contributors to VaR at the end of December 2023. The VaR increase during 2023 peaked in September, and was mainly driven by:\n\n- -interest rate risk exposures in currencies held across the Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange business lines to facilitate clientdriven activity; and\n- -the effects of relatively large short-term interest rate shocks for key currencies, which are captured in the VaR scenario window.\n\nThese factors were partly offset by lower losses from equity risks and interest rate risks that were captured within the RNIV framework.\n\nThe daily levels of total trading VaR during 2023 are set out in the graph below.\n\n## Daily VaR (trading portfolios), 99% 1 day ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other than a limited number of exceptions, these assets and liabilities are treated as traded risk for the purposes of market risk management. The exceptions primarily arise in Global Banking where the short-term acquisition and disposal of assets are linked to other non-trading-related activities such as loan origination.\n\n## Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nWe undertake derivative activity for three primary purposes: to create risk management solutions for clients, to manage the portfolio risks arising from client business, and to manage and hedge our own risks. Most of our derivative exposures arise from sales and trading activities within GBM. The assets and liabilities included in trading VaR give rise to a large proportion of the income included in net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis. Adjustments to trading income such as valuation adjustments are not measured by the trading VaR model.\n\nFor information on the accounting policies applied to financial instruments at fair value, see Note 1 on the financial statements.",

HSBC may be affected by climate risks either directly or indirectly through our relationships with our customers, which could result in both financial and non-financial impacts.\n\nOur climate risk approach aims to effectively manage the material climate risks that could impact our operations, financial performance and stability, and reputation. It is informed by the evolving expectations of our regulators.\n\nWe are developing our climate risk capabilities across our businesses, by prioritising sectors, portfolios and counterparties with the highest impacts.\n\nWe continue to make progress in enhancing our climate risk capabilities, and recognise it is a long-term iterative process.\n\nWe aim to regularly review our approach to increase coverage and incorporate maturing data, climate analytics capabilities, frameworks and tools, as well as respond to emerging industry best practice and climate risk regulations.\n\nThis includes updating our approach to reflect how the risks associated with climate change continue to evolve in the real world, and maturing how we embed climate risk factors into strategic planning, transactions and decision making across our businesses.\n\nOur climate risk approach is aligned to our Group-wide risk management framework and three lines of defence model, which sets out how we identify, assess and manage our risks. For further details of the three lines of defence framework, see page 138.\n\n- -the risk of greenwashing, which arises from the act of knowingly or unknowingly making inaccurate, unclear, misleading or unsubstantiated claims regarding sustainability to our stakeholders.\n\nThe tables below provide an overview of the climate risk drivers and thematic issues considered within HSBC's climate risk approach.\n\n| Climate risk - risk drivers Details                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                            | Potential impacts       | Time horizons        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| Physical Increased frequency and severity of weather events causing  disruption to business operations Policy and                                                                               | Decreased household income and  - Increased costs of legal and  compliance | - Medium term Long term | Acute                |\n| Chronic Longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g. sustained higher  temperatures, sea level rise, shifting monsoons or chronic  heat waves)                                                  | - Decreased real estate values or  stranded assets                         | - Medium term Long term | Acute                |\n| legal Mandates on, and regulation of products and services and/or  policy support for low-carbon alternatives.

The assessment focused on a 12-month time horizon, as well as time horizons for the short-term, medium-term and long-term periods. We define short term as time periods up to 2025; medium term as between 2026 and 2035; and long term as between 2036 and 2050. These time periods align to the Climate Action 100+ disclosure framework v1.2. The table below provides a summary of how climate risk may impact a subset of HSBC's principal risks.\n\nThe assessment is refreshed annually, and the results may change as our understanding of climate risk and how it impacts HSBC evolve (for further details, see 'Impact on reporting and financial statements' on page 44).\n\nIn addition to this assessment, we also consider climate risk in our emerging risk reporting and scenario analysis (for further details, see 'Top and emerging risks' on page 38).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Climate risk drivers   | Credit risk   | Traded risk   | Reputational risk 1   | Regulatory  compliance risk 1   | Resilience risk   | Other financial  and non-financial  risk types   |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical risk          | \u25cf             | \u25cf             | \u25cf                     |                                 | \u25cf                 | \u25cf                                                |\n| Transition risk        | \u25cf             | \u25cf             | \u25cf                     | \u25cf                               | \u25cf                 | \u25cf                                                |\n\n## Climate risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nOur climate risk programme continues to support the development of our climate risk management capabilities. The following outlines key developments in 2023:\n\n- -We updated our climate risk management approach to incorporate net zero alignment risk and developed guidance on how climate risk should be managed for non-financial risk types.\n- -We enhanced our climate risk materiality assessment to consider longer time horizons.\n- -We enhanced our approach to assessing the impact of climate change on capital, focusing on credit and market risks.\n- -We further developed our risk metrics to monitor our performance against our net zero targets for both financed emissions and own operations.\n- -We enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis, including through improvements to our use of customer transition plan data. For further details of scenario analysis, see page 65.\n- -We have updated our merger and acquisition process to consider potential climate and sustainability-related targets, net zero transition plans and climate strategy, and how this relates to HSBC.\n\nWhile we have made progress in enhancing our climate risk framework, further work remains. This includes the need to develop additional metrics and tools to measure our exposure to climaterelated risks, and to incorporate these tools within decision making.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Board takes overall supervisory responsibility for our ESG strategy, overseeing executive management in developing the approach, execution and associated reporting.\n\nThe ESG Committee supports the development and delivery of our ESG strategy, key policies and material commitments by providing oversight, coordination and management of ESG commitments and initiatives. It is co-chaired by the Group Chief Sustainability Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe Sustainability Execution Committee has oversight of the environmental strategy, including the commercial execution and operationalisation through the sustainability execution programme, which is a Group-wide programme established to enable the delivery of our sustainability agenda.\n\nThe Group Reputational Risk Committee considers climate-related matters arising from customers, transactions and third parties that either present a serious potential reputational risk to the Group or merit a Group-led decision to ensure a consistent approach to reputational risk management across the regions, global businesses and global functions.\n\nThe Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee receive regular updates on our climate risk profile and progress of our climate risk programme.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer is the senior manager responsible for the management of climate risk under the UK Senior Managers Regime, which involves holding overall accountability for the Group's climate risk programme.\n\nThe Environmental Risk Oversight Forum (formerly the Climate Risk Oversight Forum) oversees risk activities relating to climate and sustainability risk management, including the transition and physical risks from climate change. Equivalent forums have been established at a regional level.\n\nFor further details of the Group's ESG governance structure, see page 88.",

It is supported by risk appetite metrics and tolerance thresholds. We have also defined additional key management information metrics. Both the risk appetite statement and key management information metrics are reported on a quarterly basis for oversight by the Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Policies, processes and controls\n\nWe continue to integrate climate risk into policies, processes and controls across many areas of our organisation, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. For further details of how we manage climate risk across our global businesses, see page 65.\n\n## Embedding our climate risk approach\n\nThe table below provides further details of how we have embedded the management of climate risk across key risk types.

Part of our response to this heightened risk includes  undertaking a range of assurance procedures over these disclosures.                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Challenges\n\nWhile we have continued to develop our climate risk framework, our remaining challenges include:\n\n- -the diverse range of internal and external data sources and data structures needed for climate-related reporting, which introduces data accuracy and reliability risks;\n- -data limitations on customer assets and supply chains, and methodology gaps, which hinder our ability to assess physical risks accurately;\n- -industry-wide data gaps on customer emissions and transition plan and methodology gaps, which limit our ability to assess transition risks accurately; and\n- -limitations in our management of net zero alignment risk is due to known and unknown factors, including the limited accuracy and reliability of data, merging methodologies, and the need to develop new tools to better inform decision making.\n\n## Insights from climate scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our potential exposures to risks and vulnerabilities under a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis exercise by focusing our efforts on generating more granular insights for key sectors and regions to support core decision-making processes, and to respond to our regulatory requirements. We also produced several climate stress tests for regulators around the world, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ('HKMA') and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWe continue to enhance our climate scenario analysis exercises so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks and opportunities to support our strategic planning and actions.\n\nIn climate scenario analysis, we consider, jointly, both physical risks and transition risks. For further details about these risks, see 'Climate risk' on page 221.\n\nWe also analyse how these climate risks impact principal risk types within our organisation, including credit and traded market risks, nonfinancial risks, and pension risk.\n\n## Our climate scenarios\n\nIn our 2023 climate scenario analysis exercises, we explored five scenarios that were created to examine the potential impacts from climate change for the Group and its entities.\n\nThe analysis considered the key regions in which we operate, and assessed the impact on our balance sheet across three distinct timeframes: short term up to 2025; medium term from 2026 to 2035; and long term from 2036 to 2050. The time horizons are aligned to the Climate Action 100+ framework v1.2.\n\nWe created our internal scenarios using external publicly available climate scenarios as a reference, including those produced by the Network for Greening the Financial System ('NGFS'), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ('IPCC') and the International Energy Agency. Using these external scenarios as a template, we adapted them by incorporating the unique climate risks and vulnerabilities to which our organisation and customers across different business sectors and regions are exposed. This helped us produce the scenarios, which vary by severity to analyse how climate risks will impact our portfolios.",

This assumes that there will be orderly but considerable climate action, limiting global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, when compared with pre-industrial levels;\n- -the Current Commitments scenario, which assumes that climate action is limited to current governmental committed policies, including already implemented actions, leading to global temperature rises of 2.4\u00b0C by 2100. This slow transition scenario helps us to determine the actions we need to take to reach our net zero ambition while operating in a world that is not net zero;\n- -the Delayed Transition Risk scenario, which assumes that climate action is delayed until 2030 with a late disorderly transition to net zero but stringent and rapid enough to limit global warming to under 2\u00b0C by 2100. This scenario allows us to stress test severe but plausible transition risk impacts;\n- -the Downside Physical Risk scenario, which assumes climate action is limited to currently implemented governmental policies, leading to extreme global warming with global temperatures increasing by greater than 4\u00b0C by 2100. This scenario allows us to assess physical risks associated with climate change; and\n- -the Near Term scenario, which assumes both a sharp increase in policies that drive a disorderly transition towards net zero and a sharp increase in extreme climate events over a five-year period until 2027. This scenario focused on our business in Asia.\n\nWe have chosen these scenarios to provide a holistic view that will supplement the Group's current and future strategic thinking. They reflect inputs from our key stakeholders and experts across the Group, and have been reviewed through internal governance.\n\nOur scenarios reflect different levels of physical and transition risks over a variety of time periods. The scenario assumptions include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors and technological developments. However, these scenarios rely on the development of technologies that are still unproven, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonise aviation and shipping.\n\nThe nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis lead to outcomes that are indicative of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast.\n\nDevelopments in climate science, data, methodology and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view to change over time.\n\n## Characteristics of our scenarios\n\nScenarios\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                            |

we used models to assess how transition and physical risks may impact our portfolios under different scenarios. Our models incorporate a range of climate-specific metrics that will have an impact on our customers, including expected production volumes, revenue, costs and capital expenditure.\n\nWe assess how these metrics interplay with economic factors such as carbon prices, which represent the cost effect of climate-related policies that aim to discourage carbon-emitting activities and encourage low-carbon solutions. The expected result of higher carbon prices is a reduction in emissions as high-emission activities become uneconomical. We also assume carbon prices will vary from country to country.\n\nThe models for our wholesale corporate lending portfolio consider our customers' individual climate transition plans where available, while we refine and deepen our assessment of these plans. These results feed into the calculation of our risk-weighted assets and expected credit loss ('ECL') projections. For our real estate portfolio models, we focus on physical risk factors, including property locations, perils and insurance coverage when assessing the overall credit risk impact to the portfolio. The results are reviewed by our sector specialists who, subject to our governance procedures, make\n\nbespoke adjustments to our results based on their expert judgement where relevant.\n\nOur models support the calculation of outputs that inform us about the level of climate-related ECL provisions required under IFRS 9, and also support the shaping of our climate-related capital approach under ICAAP. In 2023, in addition to incorporating our customers' transition plans, we enhanced our credit risk models for the wholesale portfolio by updating our assumptions regarding how we expect statesupported companies to be impacted, and improved how we model the impact of emissions on company financial forecasts.\n\n## Modelling limitations\n\nWe continue to look for ways of enhancing our methodology to improve the effectiveness of our climate scenario analyses. There are industry-wide limitations, particularly on data availability, although our models are designed to produce outputs that can support our assessment of the level of our climate resilience.\n\nClimate scenario analysis requires considerable amounts of data, although data is only available for a subset of our counterparties. As a result, we have to extrapolate the results observed in the subset to the wider population or dataset. We do not capture the second order\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "impacts of climate risk exposures within our modelling approach, such as impacts on our counterparties from their supply chains.\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities by incorporating lessons learnt from previous exercises and feedback from key stakeholders, including regulators.\n\nFor a broad overview of the models that we use for our climate scenario analysis, as well as graphs that show how global carbon prices and carbon emissions will differ under our climate scenarios, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\n## Analysing the outputs of climate scenario analysis\n\nClimate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may affect and impact the resilience of our customers and our portfolios, particularly in respect of credit losses. As the following chart shows, losses are influenced by their exposure to a variety of climate risks under different climate scenarios.\n\n## How credit losses from climate risks have been modelled under di/fferent transition scenarios\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1   The counterfactual scenario is modelled on a scenario where there would be no losses due to climate change.\n- 2   The dotted line in the chart shows the impact of modelled expected credit losses following our strategic responses to reduce the effect of climate risks under the Net Zero scenario.\n- 3   The projections shown in this chart were modelled during 2023 and are not intended to reflect the final 31 December 2023 position that is disclosed elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 .\n\nWhile climate-related losses are expected to remain minimal in the short term, they are likely to increase compared with the counterfactual scenario in the medium and longer term, driven by the transition to a net zero economy.\n\nThese losses are lower in the Net Zero orderly transition scenario, than in the Delayed Transition Risk scenario where climate action begins later and is more rapid and disruptive as our customers will have less time to restructure their business models and reduce their carbon emissions. As the dotted line in the graph shows, losses in these scenarios can be mitigated through active management approaches, which include identifying new climate-related business opportunities and adapting our portfolios to reduce exposure to climate risks and losses.\n\nBy building a more climate-resilient balance sheet, we can reduce impairment risks and improve longer-term stability.\n\nUnder the Current Commitments scenario, we expect lower levels of losses relating to transition risks, although we would expect an increase in the effects of climate-related physical risks over the longer term. If the world does not align with a net zero path, physical risks in the medium to long term are expected to continue to rise due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.\n\n## The Near Term scenario\n\nOur Near Term scenario allowed us to explore the combined impacts of a disorderly transition towards net zero and extreme acute physical events occurring simultaneously. The scenario was designed to meet HKMA regulatory requirements and will help us to improve how we assess short-term impacts across the Group. As part of the HKMA exercise, our initial analysis was focused on our portfolio in Asia.\n\nThe exercise allowed us to understand the extent to which a stressed scenario exhibiting both high physical and transition risks in the near term could immediately impact our customers across all our sectors.\n\nIn the following sections, we assess the impacts to our banking portfolios under different climate scenarios.\n\n## How climate change is impacting our wholesale lending portfolio\n\nIn our internal climate scenario analysis, we assessed the impact of climate-related risks on our corporate counterparties under different climate scenarios, which we measured by reviewing the modelled effect on our ECL.\n\nThe climate scenario analysis exercise for the wholesale lending portfolio was designed to examine our climate risks and vulnerabilities, primarily in the short and medium term. We focused on the Current Commitment scenario, believing it to be the scenario most likely to unfold in this timeframe, and the Net Zero scenario, which allows us to assess the resilience of our strategy and to identify specific climate-related opportunities.\n\nWithin our wholesale lending portfolio, customers in higher emitting sectors continue to be most exposed to larger climate-related losses.\n\nFor each sector in both scenarios, we calculated the projected ECL increase as at 2035, where we compared the increase in ECL under the scenario against a counterfactual scenario that incorporates no climate change.\n\nWe use the sector's exposure at default ('EAD'), which represents the size of our exposure to potential losses from customer defaults. This helps to identify which sectors are the most material to us in terms of the impact of climate change.\n\nThe table below shows the relative size of exposures at default in 2023 and the increase in cumulative ECL under each scenario compared with a counterfactual scenario by 2035 (expressed as a multiple).\n\n## Impact on wholesale lending portfolios\n\n|                                      |                              | ECL increase 1       | ECL increase 1   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Wholesale sectors                    | Exposure  at default  (2023) | Current  Commitments | Net Zero         |\n| Conglomerates and  industrials       | n                            | <1.1x                | <2.75x           |\n| Construction and  building materials | n                            | <1.25x               | <2.25x           |\n| Chemicals                            | n                            | <1.1x                | <1.75x           |\n| Power and utilities                  | n                            | <1.1x                | <1.75x           |\n| Oil and gas                          | n                            | <1.1x                | <1.25x           |\n| Automotive                           | n                            | <1.25x               | <1.75x           |\n| Land transport and  logistics        | n                            | <1.1x                | <2.75x           |\n| Agriculture & soft  commodities      | n                            | <1.1x                | <2.5x            |\n| Metals and mining                    | n                            | <1.1x                | >3x              |\n| Aviation                             | n                            | <1.1x                | <1.5x            |\n| Marine                               | n                            | <1.1x                | <1.5x            |\n\n- 1   Increase in cumulative ECL compared with counterfactual by 2035 expressed as a multiple.\n\nR",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\nWe have continued to incorporate information from our customers' transition plans to consider more detailed information on how they and their sector will be impacted under different climate scenarios.\n\nThe levels of ECL observed across our wholesale lending portfolio are driven by: our customers' carbon emissions; the presence of realistic transition plans; the amount of capital investment required to support their transition; and the degree to which their competitive environment impacts their ability to pass on carbon costs.\n\nIn 2022, we used scenario analysis to assess the impacts on our corporate counterparties across the sectors that are most affected by climate-related risks.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced our approach in some key high-emitting sectors, which includes the construction and building materials, power and utilities, and oil and gas sectors. The analysis below provides a more detailed view of the anticipated impacts on these portfolios and our customers, improving our understanding of climate risks and potential opportunities.\n\nThe construction and building materials sector faces an increase in losses because it includes companies with high emissions from manufacturing processes, such as steel or cement, or from their supply chains, which will increase cost pressures due to carbon taxes. The sector also has a high proportion of customers without transition plans.\n\nAlthough our scenario analysis showed that companies with transition plans performed better on average, their plans typically fall short of requirements needed to meet net zero targets. Overall, we believe there are significant lending opportunities for us to help support our customers as they transition to a lower carbon economy while meeting their growing business demands.\n\nThese opportunities include the exploration of less carbon-intensive fuel sources, electrification, the integration of carbon capture and storage, and the adoption of new technologies in the search to reduce emissions.\n\nIn the power and utilities sector, our analysis showed that rising costs from increased carbon prices and the capital expenditure required to support transition requirements, infrastructure improvements and decommissioning costs, alongside greater downstream energy demands, will potentially lead to higher debt levels and worsening counterparty risk ratings for customers.\n\nAs technologies mature, the capital cost of some renewables infrastructure is expected to fall, becoming cheaper than nonrenewable sources due to improved efficiencies. This will reduce the required expenditure for companies.\n\nIn the oil and gas sector, customers that commit to renewable energy should benefit from the additional greener revenue streams, which will help mitigate the impact of reduced profitability from fossil fuels and heightened carbon prices, enabling them to sustain their gross margins. This sector has relatively lower projected losses as a large proportion of customers provided transition plans with granular information about their climate-related impacts.\n\nWe have the opportunity to ease potential negative impacts as transition risks increase by supporting our customers to diversify into more renewable and greener revenue streams, and invest in emission-reducing technologies.\n\n## How climate change is impacting our retail mortgage portfolio\n\nAs part of our 2023 internal climate scenario analysis, we completed a detailed climate risk assessment for the UK, Hong Kong, mainland China and Australia, which together represent 75% of the balances in our global retail mortgage portfolio.\n\nOur analysis shows that over the longer term, we expect minimal losses to materialise when considering the Current Commitments scenario. Although the severity of climate perils is expected to worsen over time, our overall losses also remain low under a Downside Physical Risk scenario.\n\nIn 2023, we widened the scope of our climate modelling to include new markets, such as mainland China, and increased the peril coverage within markets already covered.\n\nIn our analysis of the retail mortgage portfolio, we reassessed the physical perils that could impact the value of properties, which include flooding, wildfire and windstorms. The underlying peril data we use has been enhanced to include updated and higher resolution flood maps where available. We have also worked with external vendors to improve outputs from peril projections and to increase the granularity of data to provide more detailed insights into the impact of climate risks across our portfolio of properties, in particular the impact of wildfires.\n\nOur scenario analysis methodology was enriched further in 2023 by combining the impacts of physical risk with transition risks, including rising energy costs and impacts from direct government legislation such as homeowner energy efficiency upgrades in the UK. We have enhanced our modelling by considering customers' affordability incorporating increased debt servicing costs and the impacts on property valuations. As insurance remains a key mitigator against climate losses, we further refined our assumptions including the assessment of insurance availability for properties that experience frequent climate events.\n\n## Projected peril risk\n\nFlooding has the potential to drive significant impacts at an aggregate level but this is localised to specific areas that are close to water sources such as rivers or the coast, or areas that are located in valleys where surface water can 'pool'.\n\nThe 'Exposure to flooding' table below shows that the majority of properties located in four of our largest markets are predicted to experience zero to low risk of flooding, with flood depths of less than 0.5 metres, under a 1-in-100-year event in each of the scenarios.\n\nFlood depths outlined here do not consider building type and property floor level, which would potentially further mitigate the impacts. However, they are considered within our climate risk modelling and loss projections.\n\nThe table below sets out the proportion of properties with projected flood depths in a 1-in-100-year severity flood event, under the Current Commitments and Downside Physical Risk scenarios.\n\n## Exposure to flooding (%) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                         | Scenarios             | Scenarios                                       | Scenarios                        | Scenarios                           |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Number of  properties 2 | Flood depth  (metres) | Baseline     flood risk              2023 3 (%) | Current  Commitments  2050   (%) | Downside  Physical  Risk 2050   (%) |\n| UK                      | 0-0.5                 | 97.4                                            | 97.4                             | 96.9                                |\n|                         | 0.5-1.5               | 2.4                                             | 2.5                              | 2.8                                 |\n| n                       | >1.5                  | 0.2                                             | 0.2                              | 0.3                                 |\n| Hong Kong               | 0-0.5                 | 85.3                                            | 81.4                             | 79.5                                |\n|                         | 0.5-1.5               | 14.6                                            | 18.4                             | 20.4                                |\n| n                       | >1.5                  | 0.1                                             | 0.1                              | 0.1                                 |\n| Australia               | 0-0.5                 | 95.7                                            | 95.4                             | 95.3                                |\n|                         | 0.5-1.5               | 2.9                                             | 3.0                              | 3.1                                 |\n| n                       | >1.5                  | 1.5                                             | 1.5                              | 1.5                                 |\n| Mainland                | 0-0.5                 | 88.0                                            | 86.5                             | 84.7                                |\n| China                   | 0.5-1.5               | 11.1                                            | 12.5                             | 12.7                                |\n| n                       | >1.5                  | 0.9                                             | 1.0                              | 2.7                                 |\n\n- 2   The size of the bubbles represents the size of the portfolios, in terms of number of properties where exposure to flooding data is available, relative to one another.\n- 3   Baseline flood risk is the flood risk for a 1 in 100 year event, based on current peril data.",

Our commercial real estate portfolio is globally diversified with larger concentrations in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.\n\nGeographical location is a key determinant in our exposure to potential physical risk events, which can lead to higher ECL due to the cost of repairing damage as well as impact property valuations in areas where physical risk events are increasing in frequency.\n\nThe 'Exposure to peril' table below shows the proportion of our commercial real estate portfolio exposed to specific physical perils in our key markets.\n\n## Exposure to peril (%) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|           | Exposure  at  default 2   |   Coastal  inundation  (%) |   Cyclone  wind  (%) |   Surface  water  flooding  (%) |   Riverine  flooding (%) |\n|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Hong Kong | n                         |                        2   |                 94.8 |                            19   |                     10   |\n| UK        | n                         |                       15.8 |                  0   |                            16.5 |                      7.1 |\n| US        | n                         |                       10.1 |                 81.5 |                            11.4 |                     28.6 |\n\nOverall, and in line with our 2022 disclosure, our commercial real estate portfolio remains resilient to climate risk, with the more severe impacts mitigated by insurance coverage.\n\nOur most significant credit exposure is in Hong Kong, a region with material physical risk exposures to wind and flooding due to strong tropical cyclones. The impact on prospective credit losses remains low, due to stringent building standards and existing measures in place against flooding and storm surges.\n\nOur largest exposure to transition risk is within our UK portfolio. Under the Net Zero scenario, we assessed the impacts of the UK government consultation on non-domestic rental properties being required to hold an energy performance certificate rating of at least 'B' by 2030. To meet these proposed minimum standards, more than 80% of the properties in our portfolio would potentially need to be retrofitted, which would increase impairments and lead to a small uplift in ECL for this portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the scenario analysis exercise for the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, we also assessed in more detail the climate risk impacts on our UAE portfolio. Our findings showed that many properties could become chronically exposed to permanent inundation over time due to their relatively low elevation above sea level.\n\n## How we assess climate risk impacts on other risk types\n\nWe use climate scenario analysis to assess the impacts on other risks beyond credit risk. These include traded market risks, nonfinancial risks and pension risk.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nIn 2023, we explored the potential impacts of climate risks on our trading and banking portfolio under the Delayed Transition Risk and Downside Physical Risk scenarios.\n\nThe analysis considered all relevant asset classes including interest rates, exchange rates, corporate and sovereign bonds and equities. The analysis applied shocks reflecting the impact of abrupt increases in carbon prices or physical risk perils resulting in structural economic impacts that affect the productivity of high-risk sectors at a country level .\n\nWe have developed tools to provide us with a more granular understanding of the key profit and loss drivers under different climate scenarios. These can be viewed by risk factor, business line or at trading desk level to help traded risk managers to monitor and understand how climate sensitive exposures are impacted.\n\n## Sovereign credit risk\n\nWe assessed the impacts of climate risks on sovereign debt under the different climate scenarios. In particular, our models considered the impacts of climate change on a country's GDP, the amount of headroom sovereign nations have in terms of their fiscal and external reserves, and their dependency and exposure to particular corporate sectors.\n\n## Pension risk\n\nWe modelled balance sheet and income statement projections for the main pension plans. Our modelling capability has been enhanced to incorporate climate-specific modelling over a longer timeframe, with the initial exercise being focused on assessing the impacts of a disruptive transition to net zero using the Delayed Transition scenario.\n\n## Non-financial risk\n\nWe assessed the potential impacts of errors in sustainable lending volumes contained within our ESG disclosures as part of our financial reporting risks. To understand our regulatory compliance risks we assessed any misrepresentations within the marketing of our ESG funds.\n\n## Use of climate scenario analysis outputs\n\nClimate scenario analysis plays a crucial role helping us to identify and understand the impact of climate-related risks and potential opportunities as we navigate the transition to net zero.\n\nScenario analysis results have been used to support the Group's ICAAP. This is an internal assessment of the capital the Group needs to hold to meet the risks identified on a current and projected basis, including climate risk.\n\nIn addition, scenario analysis informs our risk appetite statement metrics. As an example, it supports the calibration of physical risk metrics for our retail mortgage portfolios and it is used to consider climate impact in our IFRS 9 assessment.\n\nFrom a financial planning perspective, internal climate scenario analysis results are used to assess whether additional short-term climate-specific ECL are required within our financial plan.\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe plan to continue to enhance our capabilities for climate scenario analysis including addressing model limitations and data gaps and developing our assessment of liquidity, resilience and insurance risks. We also plan to use the results for decision making, particularly in:\n\n- -client engagement, by identifying climate opportunities and vulnerabilities in specific regions and sectors such as renewables, carbon capture technologies and electric vehicles, and using this information to engage and support clients in their transition to net zero;\n- -portfolio steering, by using scenario analysis outputs to inform how to reallocate our portfolio to maximise returns and mitigate risk while achieving our net zero targets; and\n- -looking beyond climate change by building capabilities to assess our resilience to wider environmental risks.\n\n## Understanding the resilience of our critical properties\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings that we occupy as an organisation, including our offices, retail branches and data centres, both in terms of loss and damage, and business interruption.\n\nWe measure the impacts of climate and weather events to our buildings on an ongoing basis using historical, current and scenario modelled forecast data. In 2023, there were 27 major storms that had a minor impact on five premises with no impact on the availability of our buildings.",

Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2023, analysed how eight climate change-related hazards could impact 1,000 of our critical and important buildings. These hazards were coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, pluvial flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding.\n\nThe 2023 stress test modelled climate change with IPCC's Taking the Highway scenario (SSP5-8.5), which projects that the rise in global temperatures will likely exceed 4\u00b0C by 2100. It also modelled a less severe IPCC Middle of the Road scenario (SSP2-4.5), which projects that global warming will likely be limited to 2\u00b0C.\n\nKey findings from the Taking the Highway scenario included that by 2050, 20 of our 1,000 critical and important buildings will have a high potential for impact due to climate change, with insurance-related losses estimated to be in excess of 10% of the insured value of the buildings.\n\nThese include 16 retail properties primarily impacted by extreme temperatures and four data centres, where three face the risk of water stress and one faces extreme temperatures and water stress. This could lead to failure of mechanical cooling equipment or soil movement resulting from drought.\n\n## Resilience risk\n\n## Overview\n\nResilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution, delivery, physical security or safety events, causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties. Resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes, people, systems or external events.\n\n## Resilience risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nDuring the year, we carried out several initiatives to keep pace with geopolitical, regulatory and technology changes, and strengthened the management of resilience risk:\n\n- -We focused on enhancing our understanding of our risk and control environment, by updating our risk taxonomy and control libraries, and refreshing risk and control assessments.\n- -We continued to recognise that our customers are impacted by service disruptions, and responded to these urgently and aimed to recover with minimum delay. We continued to initiate postincident review processes to prevent recurrence. Where we identify that investment is required to further enhance the Group's operational resilience capabilities, findings are fed into the Group's financial planning, helping to ensure we continue to meet the expectations of our customers and our regulators.\n- -We continued to monitor markets affected by the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, as well as other geopolitical events, for any potential impact they may have on our colleagues and operations.\n- -We strengthened the way third-party risk is overseen and managed across all non-financial risks, and enhanced the processes, framework and reporting capabilities used by our global businesses, functions and regions.\n- -We provided analysis and easy-to-access risk and control information and metrics to enable management to focus on nonfinancial risks in their decision making and appetite setting.\n- -We further strengthened our non-financial risk governance and senior leadership, and improved our coverage and risk steward oversight for data risk and change execution.\n\nA further 248 properties have the potential to be impacted by climate change, albeit to a lesser extent, with insurance-related losses estimated at between 5% and 10% of the insured value of our buildings. The principal risks are temperature extremes and water stress.\n\nA key finding from the Middle of the Road scenario showed that the total number of buildings at risk reduced from 20 to 13. The highlighted facilities are still at risk from the same perils of extreme temperature and water stress by 2050.\n\nThis forward-looking data along with historical data helps inform real estate planning. We will continue to enhance our understanding of how extreme weather events impact our building portfolio as climate risk assessment tools improve and evolve. We buy insurance for property damage and business interruption and consider insurance as a loss mitigation strategy depending on its availability and price.\n\nWe regularly review and enhance our building selection process and global engineering standards and will continue to assess historical claims data to help ensure our building selection and design standards address the potential impacts of climate change.\n\nWe prioritise our efforts on material risks and areas undergoing strategic growth, aligning our location strategy to this need. We also remotely provide oversight and stewardship, including support of chief risk officers, in territories where we have no physical presence.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management target operating model provides a globally consistent view across resilience risks, strengthening our risk management oversight while operating effectively as part of a simplified non-financial risk structure.\n\nWe view resilience risk across seven sub-risk types related to: thirdparty risk; technology and cybersecurity risk; transaction processing risk; business interruption and incident risk; data risk; change execution risk; and facilities availability, safety and security risk.\n\nRisk appetite and key escalations for resilience risk are reported to the Non-Financial Risk Management Board, chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, with an escalation path to the Group Risk Management Meeting and Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nOperational resilience is our ability to anticipate, prevent, adapt, respond to, recover and learn from operational disruption while minimising customer and market impact. Resilience is determined by assessing whether we can continue to provide our important business services, within an agreed impact tolerance. This is achieved via day-to-day oversight and periodic and ongoing assurance, such as deep dive reviews and controls testing, which may result in challenges being raised to the business by risk stewards. Further challenge is also raised in the form of risk steward opinion papers to formal governance. We accept we will not be able to prevent all disruption but we must prioritise investment to continually improve the response and recovery strategies for our important business services and important group business services to meet regulatory expectations.\n\n## Business operations continuity\n\nWe continue to monitor the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and remain ready to take measures to ensure business continuity in affected markets should the situations require. There have been no significant disruptions to our services, although businesses and functions in nearby markets continually review their plans and responses to minimise any potential impacts.",

Regulatory compliance risk arises from the failure to observe relevant laws, codes, rules and regulations and can manifest itself in poor market or customer outcomes and lead to fines, penalties and reputational damage to our business.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nThe dedicated programme to embed our updated purpose-led conduct approach has concluded. Work to map applicable regulations to our risks and controls continued in 2023, alongside the adoption of new tooling to support enterprise-wide horizon scanning for new regulatory obligations and supporting wider work on regulatory reporting enhancements. Climate risk has been integrated into regulatory compliance policies and processes, with enhancements made to the product governance framework and controls to ensure the effective consideration of climate - and in particular the risk of greenwashing - risks.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Compliance function has now been restructured and integrated into a combined Risk and Compliance function with the appointment of a Group Head of Regulatory Compliance reporting directly into the\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\n## Overview\n\nFinancial crime risk is the risk that HSBC's products and services will be exploited for criminal activity. This includes fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions and export control violations, money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Financial crime risk arises from day-to-day banking operations involving customers, third parties and employees.\n\n## Financial crime risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nWe regularly review the effectiveness of our financial crime risk management framework, which includes continued consideration of the complex and dynamic nature of sanctions compliance and export control risk. We continued to respond to the financial sanctions and trade restrictions that have been imposed on Russia, including methods used to limit sanctions evasion.\n\nWe continued to make progress with several key financial crime risk management initiatives, including:\n\n- -We deployed our intelligence-led, dynamic risk assessment capability for customer account monitoring in additional entities and global businesses, including in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, Hong Kong and the UAE.\n- -We deployed a next generation capability to increase our monitoring coverage on correspondent banking activity.\n- -We successfully introduced the required changes to our transaction screening capability to accommodate the global change to payment systems formatting under ISO 20022 requirements.\n- -We made enhancements in response to the rapidly evolving and complex global payments landscape and refined our digital assets and currencies strategy.\n\nGroup Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. Regulatory Compliance and Financial Crime teams work together and with relevant stakeholders to achieve good conduct outcomes, and provide enterprise-wide support on the compliance risk agenda in close collaboration with colleagues from the Group Risk and Compliance function.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nThe Global Regulatory Compliance capability is responsible for setting global policies, standards and risk appetite to guide the Group's management of regulatory compliance risk. It also devises the required frameworks, support processes and tooling to protect against regulatory compliance risks. The Group capability provides oversight, review and challenge of the global market, regional and line of business teams to help them identify, assess and mitigate regulatory compliance risks, where required. The Group's regulatory compliance risk policies are regularly reviewed. Global policies and procedures require the identification and escalation of any actual or potential regulatory breaches, and relevant events and issues are escalated to the Group's Non-Financial Risk Management Board, the Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee, as appropriate. The Group Head of Regulatory Compliance reports to the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, and attends the Risk and Compliance Executive Committee, the Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe structure of the Financial Crime function remained substantively unchanged in 2023, although we continued to review the effectiveness of our governance framework to manage financial crime risk. The Group Head of Financial Crime and Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer continues to report to the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, while the Group Risk Committee retains oversight of matters relating to financial crime.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nWe will not tolerate knowingly conducting business with individuals or entities believed to be engaged in criminal activity. We require everybody in HSBC to play their role in maintaining effective systems and controls to prevent and detect financial crime. Where we believe we have identified suspected criminal activity or vulnerabilities in our control framework, we will take appropriate mitigating action.\n\nWe manage financial crime risk because it is the right thing to do to protect our customers, shareholders, staff, the communities in which we operate, as well as the integrity of the financial system on which we all rely. We operate in a highly regulated industry in which these same policy goals are codified in law and regulation.\n\nWe are committed to complying with the laws and regulations of all the markets in which we operate and applying a consistently high financial crime standard globally.\n\nWe continue to assess the effectiveness of our end-to-end financial crime risk management framework, and invest in enhancing our operational control capabilities and technology solutions to deter and detect criminal activity. We have simplified our framework and consolidated previously separate financial crime policies into a single policy to drive consistency and provide a more holistic assessment of financial crime risk. We further strengthened our financial crime risk",

We developed more targeted metrics, and continued to seek to enhance our governance and reporting. We are committed to working in partnership with the wider industry and the public sector in managing financial crime risk and we participate in numerous public-private partnerships and information sharing initiatives around the world. In 2023, our focus remained on measures to improve the overall effectiveness of the global financial crime framework, notably by providing input into legislative and regulatory reform activities. We did this by contributing to the\n\ndevelopment of responses to consultation papers focused on how financial crime risk management frameworks can deliver more effective outcomes in detecting and deterring criminal activity. Through our work with the Wolfsberg Group and the Institute of International Finance, we supported the efforts of the global standard setter, the Financial Action Task Force. In addition, we participated in a number of public events related to enhancing public-private partnerships, payment transparency, asset recovery, tackling forestry crimes, wildlife trafficking and human trafficking.\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Overview\n\nModel risk is the risk of the potential for adverse consequences from model errors or the inappropriate use of modelled outputs to inform business decisions.\n\nModel risk arises in both financial and non-financial contexts whenever business decision making includes reliance on models.\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nIn 2023, we continued to make improvements in our model risk management processes amid regulatory changes in model requirements.\n\nInitiatives during the year included:\n\n- -Following regulatory feedback on a number of our model submissions for our internal ratings-based ('IRB') approach for credit risk, internal model method ('IMM') for counterparty credit risk and internal model approach ('IMA') for market risk, we implemented approved models for IMM and IMA alongside an approved IRB model for UK mortgages. We began a programme of work to address feedback from the PRA and other regulators on the IRB models for wholesale credit.\n- -We made changes to our VaR model in response to multiple breaches that had been observed from market volatility resulting from changes in monetary policy in major markets.\n- -We introduced a new procedure to ensure any new tool developed using generative AI would require validation by Model Risk Management before its use.\n- -We enhanced our frameworks and controls as climate risk and AI and machine learning models become more embedded in business processes.\n- -Following the publication of Supervisory Statement 1/23 - the PRA's guiding principles for how model risks should be managed across the industry - we began a programme of work to seek to meet the enhanced model risk management requirements, with representation from all global businesses and key functions, including Internal Audit.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nModel risk governance committees at the Group, business and functional levels provide oversight of model risk. The committees include senior leaders from the three global businesses and the Group Risk and Compliance function, and focus on model-related concerns and are supported by key model risk metrics. We also have Model Risk Committees in our geographical regions focused on local delivery and requirements. The Group-level Model Risk Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, and the heads of key businesses participate in these meetings.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nWe use a variety of modelling approaches, including regression, simulation, sampling, machine learning and judgemental scorecards for a range of business applications. These activities include customer selection, product pricing, financial crime transaction monitoring, creditworthiness evaluation and financial reporting. Global responsibility for managing model risk is delegated from the Board to the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, who authorises the Group Model Risk Committee. This committee regularly reviews our model risk management policies and procedures, and requires the first line of defence to demonstrate comprehensive and effective controls based on a library of model risk controls provided by Model Risk Management. Model Risk Management also reports on model risk to senior management and the Group Risk Committee on a regular basis through the use of the risk map, risk appetite metrics and top and emerging risks.\n\nWe regularly review the effectiveness of these processes, including the model risk committee structure, to help ensure appropriate understanding and ownership of model risk is embedded in the businesses and functions.",

These have a direct impact on the financial results and capital positions of the insurance operations. Liquidity risk, while significant in other parts of the Group, is less material for our insurance operations.\n\n## HSBC's insurance business\n\nWe sell insurance products through a range of channels including our branches, insurance sales forces, direct channels and third-party distributors. The majority of sales are through an integrated bancassurance model that provides insurance products principally for customers with whom we have a banking relationship, although the proportion of sales through other sources such as independent financial advisers, tied agents and digital platforms is increasing.\n\nFor the insurance products we manufacture, the majority of sales are savings, universal life and protection contracts.\n\nWe choose to manufacture these insurance products in HSBC subsidiaries based on an assessment of operational scale and risk appetite. Manufacturing insurance allows us to retain the risks and rewards associated with writing insurance contracts by keeping part of the underwriting profit and investment income within the Group.\n\nWe have life insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in eight markets, which are Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China, France, UK, Malta, Mexico and Argentina. In addition, we have: an interest in a life insurance manufacturing associate in India; a captive insurance entity in Bermuda that insures the non-financial risks of the wider Group; and a reinsurance entity in Bermuda.\n\nWhere we do not have the risk appetite or operational scale to be an effective insurance manufacturer, we engage with a small number of leading external insurance companies in order to provide insurance products to our customers. These arrangements are generally structured with our exclusive strategic partners and earn the Group a combination of commissions, fees and a share of profits. We distribute insurance products in all of our geographical regions.\n\nThis section focuses only on the risks relating to the insurance products we manufacture.\n\n## Insurance manufacturing operations risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2023\n\nThe insurance manufacturing subsidiaries follow the Group's risk management framework. In addition, there are specific policies and practices relating to the risk management of insurance contracts, which did not change materially over 2023. During the year, there was continued market volatility observed across interest rates, equity and credit markets and foreign exchange rates. This was predominantly driven by geopolitical factors and wider inflationary concerns. One key area of risk management focus during 2023 was the implementation of the new accounting standard, IFRS 17\n\n'Insurance Contracts', which became effective on 1 January 2023. Given the fundamental change the new accounting standard represented in insurance accounting, and the complexity of the new standard, this presented additional financial reporting and model risks for the Group, which were managed via the IFRS 17 implementation project. Other areas of focus were the ongoing integration of the insurance business that was acquired through AXA Singapore in 2022 into the Group's risk management framework, the establishment of a reinsurance entity in Bermuda and controls supporting IFRS 17 implementation.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\n## (Audited)\n\nInsurance manufacturing risks are managed to a defined risk appetite, which is aligned to the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework, including its three lines of defence model. For details of the Group's governance framework, see page 137. The Global Insurance Risk Management Meeting oversees the control framework globally and is accountable to the WPB Risk Management Meeting on risk matters relating to the insurance business.\n\nThe monitoring of the risks within our insurance operations is carried out by Insurance Risk teams. The Group's risk stewardship functions support the Insurance Risk teams in their respective areas of expertise.\n\n## Stress and scenario testing\n\n## (Audited)\n\nStress testing forms a key part of the risk management framework for the insurance business. We participate in local and Group-wide regulatory stress tests, as well as internally developed stress and scenario tests, including Group internal stress test exercises.\n\nThe results of these stress tests and the adequacy of management action plans to mitigate these risks are considered in the Group's ICAAP and the entities' regulatory Own Risk and Solvency Assessments, which are produced by all material entities.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## Market risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nAll our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have market risk mandates and limits that specify the investment instruments in which they are permitted to invest and the maximum quantum of market risk that they may retain. They manage market risk by using, among others, some or all of the techniques listed below, depending on the nature of the contracts written:\n\n- -We are able to adjust bonus rates to manage the liabilities to policyholders for products with participating features. The effect is that a significant proportion of the market risk is borne by the policyholder.\n- -We use asset and liability matching where asset portfolios are structured to support projected liability cash flows. The Group manages its assets using an approach that considers asset quality, diversification, cash flow matching, liquidity, volatility and target investment return. We use models to assess the effect of a range of future scenarios on the values of financial assets and associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ the outcomes in determining how best to structure asset holdings to support liabilities.\n- -We use derivatives and other financial instruments to protect against adverse market movements.\n- -We design new products to mitigate market risk, such as changing the investment return sharing proportion between policyholders and the shareholder.",

Our assessment of the creditworthiness of issuers and counterparties is based primarily upon internationally recognised credit ratings and other publicly available information.\n\nStress testing is performed on investment credit exposures using credit spread sensitivities and default probabilities.\n\nWe use a number of tools to manage and monitor credit risk. These include a credit report containing a watch-list of investments with current credit concerns, primarily investments that may be at risk of future impairment or where high concentrations to counterparties are present in the investment portfolio. Sensitivities to credit spread risk are assessed and monitored regularly.\n\n## Capital and liquidity risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nCapital risk for our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries is assessed in the Group's ICAAP based on their financial capacity to support the risks to which they are exposed. Capital adequacy is assessed on both the Group's economic capital basis, and the relevant local insurance regulatory basis.\n\nRisk appetite buffers are set to ensure that the operations are able to remain solvent, allowing for business-as-usual volatility and extreme but plausible stress events.\n\ninvesting in high credit-quality investments with deep and liquid markets, monitoring investment concentrations and restricting them where appropriate, and establishing committed contingency borrowing facilities.\n\nInsurance manufacturing subsidiaries complete quarterly liquidity risk reports and an annual review of the liquidity risks to which they are exposed.\n\n## Insurance underwriting risk\n\nOur insurance manufacturing subsidiaries primarily use the following frameworks and processes to manage and mitigate insurance underwriting risks:\n\n- -a formal approval process for launching new products or making changes to products;\n- -a product pricing and profitability framework, which requires initial and ongoing assessment of the adequacy of premiums charged on new insurance contracts to meet the risks associated with them;\n- -a framework for customer underwriting;\n- -reinsurance, which cedes risks to third-party reinsurers to keep risks within risk appetite, reduce volatility and improve capital efficiency; and\n- -oversight by financial reporting committees in each of our entities of the methodology and assumptions that underpin IFRS 17 reporting.\n\nLiquidity risk is less material for the insurance business. It is managed by cash flow matching and maintaining sufficient cash resources,\n\n## Insurance manufacturing operations risk in 2023\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe following tables show the composition of the fair value of underlying items of the Group's participating contracts at the reporting date.\n\nBalance sheet of insurance manufacturing subsidiaries by type of contract\n\n(Audited)\n\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                                                                          | Life direct  participating  and  investment  DPF  contracts 1 $m   | Life other  contracts 2 $m   | Other contracts 3 $m   | Shareholder  assets and liabilities $m   | Total $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Financial assets                                                                                        | 113,605                                                            | 3,753                        | 5,812                  |                                          | 130,866    |\n|                                                                                                         |                                                                    |                              |                        | 7,696                                    |            |\n| -

Market factors include interest rates, equity and growth assets, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur exposure varies depending on the type of contract issued. Our most significant life insurance products are contracts with participating features. These products typically include some form of capital guarantee or guaranteed return on the sums invested by the policyholders, to which bonuses are added if allowed by the overall performance of the funds. These funds are primarily invested in fixed interest, with a proportion allocated to other asset classes to provide customers with the potential for enhanced returns.\n\nParticipating products expose HSBC to the risk of variation in asset returns, which will impact our participation in the investment performance.\n\nIn addition, in some scenarios the asset returns can become insufficient to cover the policyholders' financial guarantees, in which case the shortfall has to be met by HSBC. Amounts are held against the cost of such guarantees, calculated by stochastic modelling in the larger entities.\n\nThe cost of such guarantees are generally not material and are absorbed by the insurance fulfilment cash flows.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts, market risk is substantially borne by the policyholder, but some market risk exposure typically remains, as fees earned are related to the market value of the linked assets.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe following table provides the impacts on the CSM, profit after tax and equity of our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries from reasonably possible effects of changes in selected interest rate, credit spread, equity price, growth assets and foreign exchange rate scenarios for the year. These sensitivities are prepared in accordance with current IFRS Accounting Standards and are based on changing one assumption at a time with other variables being held constant, which in practice could be correlated.\n\nDue in part to the impact of the cost of guarantees and hedging strategies, which may be in place, the relationship between the CSM, profit after tax and total equity and the risk factors is non-linear. Therefore, the results disclosed should not be extrapolated to measure sensitivities to different levels of stress. For the same reason, the impact of the stress is not necessarily symmetrical on the upside and downside. The sensitivities are stated before allowance for management actions, which may mitigate the effect of changes in the market environment.\n\nThe method used for deriving sensitivity information and significant market risk factors remain consistent between 2022 and 2023. In 2022, due to a lower CSM level, some portfolios generated onerous contracts in the 100bps up scenarios for interest rate and credit spread sensitivities, generating income statement losses and equity reductions in those scenarios. This was less prevalent in 2023 as the base CSMs were higher from changing market conditions and changes in lapse rate assumptions.",

It arises in two main areas for our insurance manufacturers:\n\n- -risk associated with credit spread volatility and default by debt security counterparties after investing premiums to generate a return for policyholders and shareholders; and\n- -risk of default by reinsurance counterparties and nonreimbursement for claims made after ceding insurance risk.\n\nThe amounts outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of these items are shown in the table on page 234.\n\nThe credit quality of the reinsurers' share of liabilities under insurance contracts is assessed as 'satisfactory' or higher (as defined on page 148), with 100% of the exposure being neither past due nor impaired (2022: 100%).\n\nCredit risk on assets supporting unit-linked liabilities is predominantly borne by the policyholders. Therefore, our exposure is primarily\n\nrelated to liabilities under non-linked insurance and investment contracts and shareholders' funds. The credit quality of insurance financial assets is included in the table on page 172.\n\nThe risk associated with credit spread volatility is to a large extent mitigated by holding debt securities to maturity, and sharing a degree of credit spread experience with policyholders.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n(Audited)\n\n## Description and exposure\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an insurance operation, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations when they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. Liquidity risk may be able to be shared with policyholders for products with participating features.\n\nThe remaining maturity of insurance contract liabilities is included in Note 4 on page 362.",

These parameters include mortality, morbidity, longevity, lapse and expense rates. Lapse risk exposure on products with premium financing increased over the year as rising interest rates led to an increase in the cost of financing for customers.\n\nThe principal risk we face is that, over time, the cost of the contract, including claims and benefits, may exceed the total amount of premiums and investment income received.\n\nThe tables on pages 234 analyse our life insurance underwriting risk exposures by composition of the fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThe insurance underwriting risk profile and related exposures remain largely consistent with those observed at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the CSM, profit and total equity to reasonably foreseeable changes in non-economic assumptions across all our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.\n\nThese sensitivities are prepared in accordance with current IFRS Accounting Standards, which have changed following the adoption of IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', effective from 1 January 2023. Further information about the adoption of IFRS 17 is provided on page 342.\n\nMortality and morbidity risk is typically associated with life insurance contracts. The effect on profit of an increase in mortality or morbidity depends on the type of business being written.\n\nSensitivity to lapse rates depends on the type of contracts being written. An increase in lapse rates typically has a negative effect on CSM (and therefore expected future profits) due to the loss of future income on the lapsed policies. However, some contract lapses have a positive effect on profit due to the existence of policy surrender charges.\n\nExpense rate risk is the exposure to a change in the allocated cost of administering insurance contracts. To the extent that increased expenses cannot be passed on to policyholders, an increase in expense rates will have a negative effect on our profits. This risk is generally greatest for our smaller entities.\n\nThe impact of changing insurance underwriting risk factors is primarily absorbed within the CSM, unless contracts are onerous in which case the impact is directly to profits. The impact of changes to the CSM is released to profits over the expected coverage periods of the related insurance contracts.\n\n## Sensitivity of HSBC's insurance manufacturing subsidiaries to insurance underwriting risk factors\n\n(Audited)\n\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                   | Effect on CSM  (gross) 1 $m   | Effect on profit  after tax (gross) 1 $m   | Effect on profit  after tax (net) 2 $m   | Effect on total  equity (gross) 1 $m   | Effect on total  equity (net) 2 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 10% increase in mortality and/or morbidity rates | (392)                         | (49)                                       | (24)                                     | (49)                                   | (24)                                 |\n| 10% decrease in mortality and/or morbidity rates | 440                           | 22                                         | 30                                       | 22                                     | 30                                   |\n| 10% increase in lapse rates                      | (316)                         | (33)                                       | (24)                                     | (33)                                   | (24)                                 |\n| 10% decrease in lapse rates                      | 348                           | 22                                         | 29                                       | 22                                     | 29                                   |\n| 10% increase in expense rates                    | (68)                          | (9)                                        | (6)                                      | (9)                                    | (6)                                  |\n| 10% decrease in expense rates                    | 69                            | 8                                          | 11                                       | 8                                      | 11                                   |\n| At 31 Dec 2022 3                                 |                               |                                            |                                          |                                        |                                      |\n| 10% increase in mortality and/or morbidity rates | (354)                         | (23)                                       | (21)                                     | (23)                                   | (21)                                 |\n| 10% decrease in mortality and/or morbidity rates | 374                           | 16                                         | 18                                       | 16                                     | 18                                   |\n| 10% increase in lapse rates                      | (225)                         | (23)                                       | (23)                                     | (23)                                   | (23)                                 |\n| 10% decrease in lapse rates                      | 232                           | 22                                         | 22                                       | 22                                     | 22                                   |\n| 10% increase in expense rates                    | (59)                          | (7)                                        | (7)                                      | (7)                                    | (7)                                  |\n| 10% decrease in expense rates                    | 60                            | 4                                          | 5                                        | 4                                      | 5                                    |",

The Group has a comprehensive range of policies and procedures in place designed to help ensure that it is well managed, with effective oversight and controls.\n\n## Board and executive governance\n\nThe Board, led by the Group Chairman, is responsible among other matters for:\n\n- -promoting the Group's long-term success and delivering sustainable value to shareholders;\n- -establishing and approving the Group's strategy and objectives, and monitoring the alignment of the Group's purpose, strategy and values with the desired culture and standards;\n- -setting the Group's risk appetite and monitoring the Group's risk profile;\n- -approving and monitoring capital and financial resource plans for achieving strategic objectives, including material transactions;\n- -considering and approving the Group's technology and environmental, social and governance strategies;\n- -ensuring effective engagement with, and encouraging participation from, shareholders and other key stakeholders;\n- -approving the appointment and remuneration of Directors, including Board roles;\n- -reviewing the Group's overall corporate governance arrangements; and\n- -providing entrepreneurial leadership of the Group within a framework of prudent and effective controls.\n\nThe Board's responsibilities are set out in a schedule of matters reserved within its terms of reference, which are available on our website at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-and-governance/ board-responsibilities. The Board's powers are subject to relevant laws, regulations and HSBC's articles of association.\n\nThe role of the independent non-executive Directors is to support the development of strategy, oversee risk, hold management to account and ensure the executive Directors are discharging their responsibilities properly, while creating the right culture to encourage constructive challenge. Further details on the independence of the Board can be found in the Nomination & Corporate Governance\n\nCommittee report on page 262. Non-executive Directors also review the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives. The Group Chairman meets with the non-executive Directors without the executive Directors in attendance after Board meetings and otherwise, as necessary.\n\nThe roles of Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board by the Group Chairman, and the executive responsibility for day-to-day management of HSBC's business, which is undertaken by the Group Chief Executive.\n\nThe majority of Board members are independent non-executive Directors. At 31 December 2023, the Board comprised the Group Chairman, 12 non-executive Directors, and two executive Directors who are the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer. As previously announced, David Nish will not stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') on 3 May 2024.\n\nFor further details of Board members' career backgrounds, skills, experience and external appointments, see their biographies on page 239, and for a breakdown of the diversity and skills of the Board and senior management, see page 247.\n\n## Operation of the Board\n\nThe Board is ordinarily scheduled to meet nine times a year. In 2023, the Board held 11 meetings. For further details on attendance at those meetings, see page 249. The Board agenda is agreed by the Group Chairman, working with both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. For further information, see 'Board matters considered and shareholder engagement' on page 254.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the Group Chief Legal Officer are regular attendees at Board meetings. The non-executive Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited is also a regular attendee at most Board meetings. The chief executive officers of the three global businesses attend Board strategy discussions, and other senior executives attend Board meetings for specific items as required.\n\nIn addition, as agreed by the Board, the Board Oversight Sub-Group is called on an ad hoc basis where necessary. Such meetings are an informal mechanism for a smaller group of Board members and management to discuss emerging issues and upcoming Board matters. The Board Oversight Sub-Group was not convened in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship between the Board and senior management\n\nThe Board delegates day-to-day management of the business and implementation of strategy to the Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is supported in his management of the Group by recommendations and advice from the Group Executive Committee ('GEC'), an executive forum comprising members of senior management that include chief executive officers of the global businesses and regions, as well as functional heads. For further details of the senior management team, see page 244.\n\nAll Directors are encouraged to have contact with management at all levels, and have full access to all relevant information. Visits to local business operations and meetings with local management are arranged for the non-executive Directors when they attend Board meetings in different locations, and when travelling for other reasons. Senior management often attend alongside Directors' stakeholder engagements (see 'Board decision making and engagement with stakeholders' on page 20). The workforce engagement non-executive Director attends the GEC on occasion to provide senior management with updates on workforce engagements carried out by the Board, including relevant Board observations. For further details, see 'Board stakeholder and workforce engagement' on page 257.\n\n## Executive governance\n\nThe GEC promotes the tone from the top, set by the Board, across the organisation. This helps to ensure that our colleagues follow our values, and foster a culture that delivers against our purpose of opening up a world of opportunity. At its meetings, the GEC dedicates time to reflect on our purpose and values and how they are demonstrated in the day-to-day course of business.\n\nDuring 2023, the GEC undertook an extensive review of the Group's strategy with a view to building upon its unique strengths. For further details of our strategy, see page 11.\n\nThe GEC has led and overseen the delivery of a number of strategic projects to simplify how we get things done, by identifying operating efficiencies, reducing complexity and optimising costs. The GEC will continue to focus on simplification throughout 2024.\n\nThe GEC's operating rhythm helps to facilitate end-to-end governance between senior leadership and the Board.\n\nThe operating rhythm has the following three pillars:\n\n- -regular check-in meetings to review and discuss current and emerging trends and issues;\n- -a monthly meeting to review the performance of each of the global businesses in principal geographical areas and legal entities, supported by the development and introduction of a new key performance indicators architecture in 2023; and\n- -a strategy- and governance-focused meeting, which is generally held two weeks in advance of each Board meeting.\n\nSeparate committees have been established to provide specialist oversight for matters delegated to the Group Chief Executive and senior management. For further details of these committees, see page 252.\n\nTo further support our senior management, we have dedicated corporate governance officers who support and advise legal entities, global businesses and global functions on our corporate governance practices. These corporate governance officers serve to strengthen the consistency and effectiveness of our end-to-end governance arrangements, and support connectivity and information sharing.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group. All subsidiary boards and their respective businesses are required to have in place effective governance arrangements with regard to the businesses' nature, size, location and the sectors in which they operate.\n\n## The subsidiary accountability framework\n\nThe subsidiary accountability framework aims to balance appropriate governance oversight by the Group with each subsidiary's local legal and regulatory duties. The framework supports the Group in promoting effective governance arrangements across its subsidiaries by:\n\n- -setting out high level principles to enhance communications and connectivity; and\n- -ensuring a shared and consistent understanding of the Group's strategic objectives, culture and values.\n\nThe subsidiary accountability framework also focuses on ensuring that each subsidiary is led by an effective board with an appropriate balance of skills, diversity, experience and knowledge, having regard to the nature of the subsidiary's business and local legal and regulatory requirements. Board composition of the Group's subsidiaries is kept under review as part of succession planning.\n\nThe framework is subject to periodic review by the Board and/or the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee and updated as required to ensure it is aligned to best practice.\n\n## The role of principal subsidiaries\n\nCertain subsidiaries are designated formally by the Board as principal subsidiaries. In addition to their obligations under their respective local laws and regulations, principal subsidiaries, supported by regional company secretaries, perform a critical role in ensuring effective and high standards of governance across the Group and in overseeing the implementation of the subsidiary accountability framework in the regions for which they are responsible.\n\nRepresentatives from principal subsidiaries attend the Board and its committee meetings for relevant topics, including when the Board holds meetings outside of the UK. Chairs of the principal subsidiary risk and audit committees also regularly attend respective Group Risk Committee and Group Audit Committee meetings. Attendance and participation at these committees enhance the subsidiary directors' understanding of the challenges facing the Group and help to identify common challenges and share lessons learned. Such committee participation supplements the regular reports, certifications and escalations from principal subsidiaries' boards and their committees to the Board and relevant committee(s) of the Board.\n\nThe Group Chairman also interacts regularly with the chairs of the principal subsidiaries, including through the Chairman's Forum. The Chairman's Forum comprises the chairs of the principal subsidiaries and the chairs of the Group's audit, risk and remuneration committees, and where relevant, the Group Chief Executive, other non-executive Directors and relevant executive management, advisers and/or external experts. In 2023, the Chairman's Forum covered topics such as strategic business considerations, geopolitical issues, resolvability assessment requirements and separability, shareholder engagements, Group-wide connectivity of non-executive Directors, key regulatory themes, ESG insights, employee engagement and financial performance.\n\nThe Group Remuneration Committee Chair also hosted dedicated forums with chairs of principal subsidiaries to share key priorities for 2023 and the future. These sessions also provide an opportunity for review and input on proposed pay outcomes and allocation, before approval by the Group Remuneration Committee.",

In May 2023, a two-day nonexecutive director summit was held in Hong Kong, which brought together over 100 non-executive directors from across the Group. Connectivity was a key theme and attendees were reminded of the importance of the subsidiary accountability framework in driving consistent governance standards and ensuring connectivity and engagement across our non-executive director community. The agenda included sessions on strategy and financial performance; AsiaPacific; subsidiary governance; the macroeconomic environment; diversity and inclusion; sustainability; technology; finance; and risk.\n\nThe Bank Director Programme, launched in 2022, continues to support subsidiaries with succession planning by developing and equipping internal talent to undertake internal non-executive director roles on subsidiary boards.\n\nFollowing the success of the Bank Director Programme, a Bank Chair Programme is being developed to ensure existing and prospective chairs of subsidiary boards and board committees have the requisite knowledge, skills and behaviours to be effective chairs.",

Each standing Board committee is chaired by a non-executive Director and has a remit to cover specific topics in accordance with their respective terms of reference. Only the Group Chairman and the independent non-executive Directors are members of Board committees. Details of the work carried out by each of the Board committees can be found in the respective committee reports from page 262.\n\nThe Chairman's Committee provides the Board with the opportunity to consider ad hoc and routine matters between scheduled Board meetings. All Board members are invited to attend Chairman's Committee meetings.\n\nAs part of its ongoing review of the effectiveness of the Group's governance arrangements, and in response to the findings from the Board evaluation in 2023, the Board has decided to establish a new Group Technology Committee to oversee the Group's technology strategy and alignment with the overall Group strategy. The committee, which will be in place from 1 March 2024, will have responsibility for areas where technology is fundamental to strategic delivery, including innovation, data and cyber risk frameworks. As a result, the Technology Governance Working Group, which was established to support oversight of technology strategy, governance\n\nand emerging risks, will be demised from the same date. The terms of reference and membership of the Board committees are available at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-and-governance/boardcommittees.\n\nThe GEC has established a number of committees to support the Group Chief Executive and senior management in their running of the business, and provide specialist oversight for matters delegated to them, including capital and liquidity, risk management, disclosure and financial reporting, restructuring and investment considerations, transformation oversight, ESG matters and talent and development. These committees also help fulfil their responsibilities under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime.\n\nDuring 2023, new committees were established including the Sustainability Execution Committee to provide greater oversight of ESG matters. In addition, the Transformation Oversight Executive Committee was demised and in its place the Change Prioritisation Oversight Committee was formed. The committee provides oversight of the Group's change portfolio, focusing on investment oversight and prioritisation, as well as delivery and execution of ongoing initiatives across the Group.\n\n## Board Chair: Mark Tucker\n\n| Chairman's  Committee   | Nomination &  Corporate  Governance  Committee   | Group Audit  Committee   | Group Risk  Committee   | Group  Remuneration  Committee   | Informal governance Board Oversight Sub- Group   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Chair: Mark Tucker      | Chair: Mark Tucker                               | Chair: David Nish 1      | Chair: James Forese     | Chair: Dame Carolyn  Fairbairn   | Chair: Mark Tucker                               |\n|                         | See page 262                                     | See page 266             | See page 274            | See page 279                     | Technology  Governance Working  Group 2          |\n\nCo-Chairs:\n\nEileen Murray and\n\nSteven Guggenheimer\n\nChairman's Forum\n\nChair: Mark Tucker\n\n- 1   Brendan Nelson will be appointed as chair from 21 February 2024.\n- 2   The Technology Governance Working Group will be demised on 1 March 2024.

Biographies for each can be found from page 239.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer also helps to arrange and deliver the induction programme through formal briefings and introductory sessions with other Board members, senior management, legal counsel, auditors, tax advisers and regulators, as appropriate. Topics covered in the induction programme include, but are not limited to: purpose and values; culture and leadership; governance and stakeholder management; Directors' legal and regulatory duties; recovery and resolution planning; anti-money laundering and anti-bribery; technical and business briefings; and strategy.\n\nThe induction process is often initiated before appointment to allow each new Board member to contribute meaningfully from appointment, such as in February 2023 when Kalpana Morparia joined the Board meeting as an observer before she was appointed to the Board the following month. The structure of the induction supports good information flows within the Board and its committees, as well as between senior management and non-executive Directors, providing a clear understanding of our culture and way of operating.\n\nIn January 2023, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee agreed the proposed approach to Board training for the year. It was\n\nagreed that the training programme would include key topics relevant to the Directors' respective roles and recent developments, in areas such as corporate governance, recovery and resolution, and technology. Where appropriate, the training sessions were facilitated by external presenters who were able to provide insights into geopolitical matters, macroeconomic issues and investor sentiment. The training sessions were held as part of scheduled Board meetings to allow for in-person interactions as much as possible.\n\nDirectors were also issued routine training modules that all colleagues must complete annually. During 2023, this training covered topics including risk management, cybersecurity, sustainability, health, safety and well-being, financial crime, and data.\n\nNon-executive Directors also discussed individual development areas with the Group Chairman as part of their ongoing performance discussions with regard to their contributions on the Board. The Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer makes appropriate arrangements for any additional training needs identified using internal resources, or otherwise, at HSBC's expense.\n\nMembers of Board committees receive relevant training as appropriate. Further details on any specific training commissioned by Board committees can be found in the respective committee reports. Directors may take independent professional advice at HSBC's expense.\n\nBoard Directors who serve on principal subsidiary boards receive training that is pertinent to circumstances and context relevant to those boards. Opportunities exist for the principal subsidiary committee chairs to share their understanding of specific areas with the Board Directors as part of the Chairman's Forum. For further details, see 'The role of principal subsidiaries' on page 250.\n\nDirectors' induction and ongoing development in 2023\n\n| Director                     | Induction 1   | Strategy and  business briefings 2   | Risk and control 3   | Corporate  governance, ESG  and other  reporting matters 4   | Board global  mandatory  training 5   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Geraldine Buckingham         | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Rachel Duan                  | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Georges Elhedery             | l             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Dame Carolyn Fairbairn       | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| James Forese                 | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Ann Godbehere 6              | l             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Steven Guggenheimer          | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Kalpana Morparia             | l             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Eileen Murray                | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Brendan Nelson 6             | l             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| David Nish                   | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Swee Lian Teo 6              | l             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Noel Quinn                   | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n| Mark Tucker                  | \u00f4             | l                                    | l                    | l                                                            | l                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nl\n\nMatter considered\n\n- 1 The induction programme was delivered through formal briefings and introductory sessions including topic-specific deep dives, with Board members, senior management, legal counsel, auditors, tax advisers and regulators, as appropriate.

        "page_content": "## Board matters considered and shareholder engagement\n\nDuring 2023, the Board remained focused on HSBC's strategic direction, overseeing performance, and risk. It considered performance against financial and other strategic objectives, key business challenges, emerging risks, business development, investor relations and the Group's relationships with its stakeholders. The endto-end governance framework facilitated discussion on strategy and performance by each of the global businesses and across the principal geographical areas, which enabled the Board to support executive management with its delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Key areas of focus\n\nThe Board's key areas of focus in 2023 are set out by theme below.\n\n## Strategy and business performance\n\nThe Group remains focused on building a sustainable platform for growth by increasing returns for investors, enhancing customer service, and creating capacity for future investment. The Board reviewed progress within the Group's global businesses and regions against its four strategic pillars: Focus, Digitise, Energise and Transition. At each Board meeting in 2023, the Board discussed the Group's strategic performance and opportunities to track strategic execution and delivery.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nIn 2020, the Group announced a climate ambition to align its financed emissions to net zero by 2050, and to become net zero in its own operations and supply chain by 2030. The Group aims to achieve this by supporting clients' transition to a net zero carbon economy and focusing on sustainable finance opportunities, as well as by reducing the carbon emissions in its own operations.\n\nThe Board takes overall responsibility for ESG strategy, overseeing executive management in developing the approach, execution and associated reporting. The Board considered whether to establish a Board committee dedicated to ESG issues, but instead decided that the best way to support the oversight and delivery of the Group's climate ambition and ESG strategy was to retain governance at Board level. The GEC further enhanced its governance model of ESG matters with the introduction of a new Sustainability Execution Committee and supporting forums. These support senior management in the operationalisation of the Group's sustainability strategy, through the oversight of the sustainability execution programme. For further details of the Sustainability Execution Committee and the sustainability execution programme, see page 88.\n\nIn 2023, the Board oversaw the implementation of ESG strategy through regular dashboard reports and detailed updates including: review and approval of the net zero transition plan, deep dives on the sustainability execution programme, reviews of net zero-aligned policies and climate-aligned financing initiatives.\n\n## Financial decisions\n\nThe Board and its dedicated committees approved key financial decisions throughout the year, including the Annual Report and Accounts 2022 , the Interim Report 2023 and the first quarter and the third quarter Earnings Releases .\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Board approved the 2023 financial resource plan. The Board monitored the Group's performance against the approved plan, as well as the plans of each of the global businesses. The Board also approved the renewal of the various debt issuance programmes. In January 2024, the Board approved the financial resource plan for 2024.\n\nThe Board adopted a dividend policy designed to provide sustainable cash dividends, while retaining the flexibility to invest and grow the business in the future, supplemented by additional shareholder distributions, if appropriate. For the financial year 2023, the Group\n\nreverted to paying quarterly dividends, and achieved a dividend payout ratio of 50% of reported earnings per ordinary share ('EPS'),  in line with our published target for 2023 and 2024. EPS for this purpose excludes material notable items and related impacts, including the sale of our retail banking operations in France, the planned sale of the banking business in Canada and the acquisition of SVB UK. In addition to dividend payments, HSBC announced share buy-backs of up to $2bn each on 2 May 2023 and 1 August 2023, and a further share buy-back of up to $3bn on 30 October 2023, bringing the total announced for 2023 to $7bn.\n\nOn 21 February 2023, an interim dividend of $0.23 per share for the 2022 full-year was announced, followed by interim dividends of $0.10 each on 2 May 2023, 1 August 2023 and 30 October 2023. For further details of dividend payments, see page 435.\n\n## Risk, regulatory and legal considerations\n\nThe Board, advised by the Group Risk Committee, promotes a strong risk governance culture that shapes the Group's risk appetite and supports the maintenance of a strong risk management framework, giving consideration to the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks, including emerging risks.\n\nThe Board considered the Group's approach to risk including its regulatory obligations. A number of key frameworks, control documents, core processes and legal responsibilities were also reviewed and approved as required by the Board and/or its relevant committees. These included:\n\n- -the Group's risk appetite framework and risk appetite statement;\n- -the individual liquidity adequacy assessment process;\n- -the individual capital adequacy assessment process;\n- -the Group's obligations under the Modern Slavery Act and approval of the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement;\n- -review and approval of the self-assessment to address the BoE's Resolvability Assessment Framework;\n- -review and approval of the Group's risk data aggregation and risk reporting framework aligned to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 239 Principles;\n- -review of the latest PRA Operational Resilience self-assessment regulatory submission;\n- -annual review and approval of the internal controls framework; and\n- -the revised terms of reference for the Board and Board committees.\n\nThe Board also reviewed and monitored the implications of geopolitical and macroeconomic developments during the year, both directly and by way of updates from the Group Risk Committee, and received regular updates on the Group's risk profile, including in relation to financial crime risk.\n\n## Technology\n\nThroughout the year, the Board received detailed updates on technology and innovation from the Group Chief Operating Officer, including on the implementation of the technology strategy and key strategic business initiatives.\n\nFollowing a detailed update at the Board meeting in May 2023, at the Board's request, management engaged a third party professional services firm to review the technology strategy and provide industry and peer insights. The Board received a number of updates on the review during the second half of 2023, and recommendations were presented at the December 2023 Board meeting.\n\nMembers of the Board were also closely involved in the hiring process for the new Group Chief Information Officer, who will join the Group at the end of February 2024.",

        "page_content": "In addition, the Technology Governance Working Group continued to oversee the Group's governance of technology, and supported connectivity with the principal subsidiaries on key technology initiatives. From 1 March 2024, the Technology Governance Working Group will be demised and the Group Technology Committee will be established on the same date.\n\n## People and culture\n\nThe Board continued to dedicate time in its meetings to discuss people-related and culture-related issues, with these topics remaining an important part of its focus. Each scheduled Board meeting begins with a 'culture moment', which helps to ensure that the right cultural tone is set from the top, and sets the right cultural tone for Board discussion. To help raise its awareness of employee and other stakeholder perspectives, Board meetings and dedicated reports feature insights into behaviours within the Group, which demonstrate alignment to its purpose and values. Board papers highlight relevant stakeholder considerations, including in connection with employees. The Board also gains valuable cultural insights through its many personal interactions with the workforce and other stakeholders. For further details see 'Board decision making and engagement with stakeholders' on page 20.\n\nThe Board also learns of people and culture matters by way of presentations at the Chairman's Forum. The principal subsidiary chairs report on their respective approaches to workforce engagement as well as what they have learned from such engagements and other cultural insights. The Board also receives cultural insights from the allemployee Snapshot survey and broader reporting, which provide key data indicators, including on people's behaviours, sentiment and business outcomes. Through the work of the committees, the Board is also able to monitor how the Group's culture is working in practice by receiving people-related reports covering whistleblowing, conduct and investigations.\n\nBoard engagement with management and the wider workforce continued to remain a strong area of attention, particularly with the ongoing activities carried out by the dedicated workforce engagement non-executive Director. For further details of the work carried out by the workforce engagement non-executive Director, see page 257.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board continued to oversee the governance, smooth operation and oversight of the Group and its principal and material subsidiaries, including monitoring compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006. Governance featured prominently in the Board agendas for the year and helped to shape strategic direction and decision taking on key issues. To see how the Board considered principal decisions in relation to our strategy, see 'Principal strategic decisions' on pages 22 and 23.\n\nThe Board and senior management continued to support further improvements to various governance initiatives to encourage simplification and promote effective decision making in the business. Guidance and training for Board and committee paper templates took place across global businesses and functions throughout the course of the year to ensure a consistent approach for writing papers. In addition, to drive our simplification agenda, the Group-wide delegations of authority framework was reviewed and standardised, allowing for more efficient signing and execution of contracts and other documentation by directors and senior management across all entities.\n\nIn 2023, Jackson Tai retired as an independent non-executive Director. On 1 January 2023, Georges Elhedery joined the Board as Group Chief Financial Officer, and the following were appointed as independent non-executive Directors: Kalpana Morparia on 1 March 2023; Ann Godbehere and Brendan Nelson on 1 September 2023; and Swee Lian Teo on 1 October 2023. The Board, supported by the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, reviews the skills and experience of the Board on an ongoing basis. This ensures that the Board and its committees comprise the necessary skills, diversity, experience and competencies to discharge their responsibilities effectively. For further details of the review and changes to the Board, see the Nomination & Corporate Governance report on page 262. For further details of diversity of the Board, see page 247.",

        "page_content": "## Board engagements with shareholders\n\nIn 2023, the Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive held a Q&A session with retail shareholders as part of the Informal Shareholders' Meeting in Hong Kong, and the Board held a Q&A session with shareholders as part of the 2023 AGM in the UK. Board members remained responsive to shareholder requests, and were particularly active following the 2023 AGM poll vote result. They continued to engage in constructive dialogue with top investors, including Ping An Asset Management Co. Ltd. The Group Chairman and the Senior Independent Director, often with the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, engaged with a number of our large institutional investors in 16 meetings, including a large group gathering held with the members of The Investor Forum. The Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together and separately, attended over 100 meetings with investors. Key topics\n\nincluded our financial performance, updates on strategy and market presence, geopolitical risks and the macroeconomic outlook in key geographies.\n\nFor further details of the Group Remuneration Committee Chair's engagements with key investors and proxy advisory firms, and how they were taken into account by the Group Remuneration Committee in its decision making, see the

        "page_content": "## Board stakeholder and workforce engagement\n\nThe Board is committed to engaging with colleagues, which takes place in a two-way dialogue in a variety of forums. This helps build the Board's understanding of key themes and topics that are important to the workforce.\n\nSince his appointment as dedicated workforce engagement nonexecutive Director in 2022, and in line with the Board's expectation of the role, Jos\u00e9 Meade has helped deliver a progressive programme of engagements throughout 2023. Outcomes from these engagements have helped inform discussions and decision making in the Boardroom, by taking into account the employee voice on related key themes and topics.\n\nHis dedicated role does not preclude other Board members from engaging with the workforce. It remains the responsibility of all Directors to consider diverse stakeholder views, including employees, across the Group.\n\nFor more examples of how the Board has engaged with the workforce and other stakeholders, see 'Board decision making and engagement with stakeholders' on page 20.\n\n## Workforce engagement programme\n\nA structured workforce engagement programme has been in place throughout 2023 with a focus on topics aligned to the Group's four strategic pillars. The programme was structured around the Board's priorities and agenda in 2023. These included in-person engagements when the Board travelled to different regions for Board meetings, which were highly valued by colleagues and Board members alike.\n\nThe engagements formed the bases of Jos\u00e9 Meade's reports to the Directors, aligned to key Board agenda items including those in the geographies in which the Board met. Further engagement events, town halls and meetings with the workforce were scheduled with Board members based on their locality or coincidental travel throughout the year.\n\nThe engagement events were held both at scale and through more targeted dialogue in smaller groups, to accommodate the breadth of experience, geographical spread and range of seniority of our colleagues. These engagements were designed to promote open dialogue and two-way discussions between the Board and employees, allowing the Board to gain valuable insight on employee perspectives, and in turn inform its deliberations in decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJos\u00e9 Meade's connectivity with the employee resource groups formed part of the workforce engagement programme. He took part in the annual employee resource group summit in September to discuss his observations since taking on the workforce engagement role, and to hear feedback on how the Board could enhance support for employee resource groups. Jos\u00e9 also participated in meetings with the employee resource group to which he is aligned, UK Nurture. This helped him better understand their successes, the value of the network and agree how often and through which means he would connect with his employee resource group in 2024.\n\nDuring the year, the Board acknowledged that relevant aspects of Board discussions on workforce engagement activities and matters, informed by the employee voice, needed to make their way back to management. In this way, relevant views could be taken into consideration when progressing workforce-related matters at the executive level. To facilitate this, Jos\u00e9 Meade committed to attending\n\nthe GEC and the Chairman's Forum to discuss the key themes and outcomes from the 2023 workforce engagements. Feedback gained from the GEC session attended in November 2023 re-emphasised the value colleagues put on the two-way dialogue with Board members. This feedback helped shape the 2024 workforce engagement programme.\n\nThe Board also regularly considers other forms of employee engagement to help be informed of initiatives and sentiment, and to plan for future engagement activities. The Chairman's Forum, held in December 2023, also discussed employee feedback gained through the Group's principal subsidiaries. Jos\u00e9 Meade presented to the Chairman's Forum an overview of workforce engagement over the course of 2023 and key themes arising. He will continue to discuss workforce engagement with the GEC and the Chairman's Forum during 2024.",

Having a dedicated programme aligned to Board priorities over the course of the year has enabled me to report to the Board on the most pertinent matters depending on our location and agenda. The year 2023 was a very productive year with respect to engaging with our workforce. I met with a large number of our colleagues on a regular basis during the year, and each event has provided me with different and equally valuable insights. I have learnt the value colleagues place on having two-way dialogue with the Board. Linked to this is our non-executive Director engagement with our employee resource groups. Each non-executive Director is aligned to one of our employee resource groups, and we listened to feedback that a more structured approach to nonexecutive Director engagement would be valuable during 2024. As a result, we held dedicated meetings for non-executive Directors to meet with their employee resource groups to agree the cadence for engagement and priorities in 2024.\n\n## Q: What are your reflections on the value of Boardemployee engagement at HSBC?\n\nA: Firstly, at every employee engagement event I attended during the year, I was able to hear directly from our colleagues that is an irreplaceable and extremely valuable insight to gain as a non-executive Director. Having the employee voice in the Boardroom is crucial in equipping Directors with important context to better understand successes and challenges felt throughout the Group. It then helps empower the Board to make better recommendations and feedback to executive management with employee sentiment front-of-mind. At one of our branch visits, I was able to experience first-hand the level of care put into every single one of our clients, which was extraordinary. Following the visit, we got great feedback from the branch team that they were grateful for our time in recognising how our colleagues put customers at the centre of their work, and they said that our front-line staff were highly motivated by our kind words and encouragement.\n\nThe value of Board-employee engagement is rooted in the Board's openness to challenge and ability to adopt new approaches in response. The key outcomes we get from all our engagement events are discussed not only in the Boardroom, but with executive management and between our principal subsidiaries as well. It is this circular communication that is so important to make sure not only is the employee voice heard, but it forms a backdrop for Board and executive discussions and decisions. For instance, it was interesting to hear from graduates the importance of our hybrid working strategy to them, which was seen as a differentiator compared with competitors. Our Chairman's Forum discussed each of our regions' respective workforce engagement programmes in December, which was an invaluable session to understand regional differences in sentiment and where subsidiary Directors were focusing their time for 2024 activities.\n\n## Q: Where do you see opportunities for 2024?\n\nA: We plan to build on the successes of 2023 and engage with more colleagues over the course of 2024. Our workforce engagement plan will continue to be guided by our Board priorities for the year and tightly aligned to our four strategic pillars. The plan incorporates, where possible, participation at colleague events already scheduled, which we will supplement with targeted engagement events. We also plan to enhance the visibility of management colleagues in critical roles or on executive committee succession plans to boards across the Group. Lastly, we will align Board member scheduled travel plans to workforce engagement activities in various regions, as well as work to identify how to engage with the workforce in geographies where Board travel is not envisaged.\n\nMexico Town Hall, Mexico City, November 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\"The insight and reflections provided by the speakers was extremely useful as we had a mixture of local and global level input.\"",

In 2023, the Board performance review comprised an externally facilitated evaluation in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nDuring 2023, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee oversaw the process to appoint an independent service provider to evaluate the Board and its committees' effectiveness and performance. The Group Chairman led a formal tender process, with the support of the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, which included a desktop review of proposals and a panel interview with prospective firms to discuss their approach to the evaluation. The panel interviews included the Group Chairman, three non-executive Directors, and the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer.\n\nFollowing this process, and based on the recommendation of the panel, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee appointed Independent Board Evaluation ('IBE') to conduct the Board review in 2023. IBE is an independent external service provider with no other connection with the Group or any individual Directors.\n\n## Board and committee evaluation process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board made good progress against all of the action points identified during the 2022 evaluation. In particular:\n\n- -Management developed a new key performance indicator architecture relating to performance, execution and risk management as well as other key value drivers.\n- -The Sustainability Execution Committee, a management forum, was established to provide greater focus and accountability for progress against the Group's ESG deliverables and milestones.\n- -An independent review of the Group's technology strategy was performed by a third party, with the outcomes, including lessons learned, and next steps discussed and agreed by the Board.\n- -The Board held focused sessions on prioritisation and simplification.\n\n- -Stakeholder engagement plans were structured around the Board's visits to Paris, Hong Kong, New York and India during the year, and broader non-executive Director travel. These plans provided the Board with the opportunity to engage with the full spectrum of stakeholder groups, including employees. Further details of the Board's engagement activities are detailed on page 21.\n- -Continued training and guidance was provided to key paper authors and contributors to reinforce the importance of timely, balanced and accurate reporting to the Board.\n\n## Board effectiveness review format\n\nA comprehensive brief was provided to IBE by the Group Chairman and Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer.

        "page_content": "## Findings and recommendations\n\nOverall, the review concluded that the Board was performing well as an engaged, global governance body. The Group Chairman is regarded as an excellent leader of the Board, fostering a culture of openness, with encouragement for Board members to speak freely on any issue. In particular, the effectiveness review highlighted that the Board performed well in various areas including:\n\n- -Stakeholder accountability: The Board takes its responsibilities towards stakeholders seriously, positively and sincerely.\n- -Board culture: The culture of the Board is regarded as a key strength. Preserving and sustaining this has been a key factor in considering candidates for appointment to the Board. Communication is open and transparent.\n- -Relationship with senior management: Board members value the openness between, and access to, the senior management team.\n- -Committee chairs: Chairs of committees are well supported by the respective functional teams, including Risk, Finance, HR and Corporate Governance and Secretariat.\n- -Board resources and support: The Board appreciates the strategic advice and counsel it receives on governance issues from the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer and her team.\n\nIBE presented its report to the December 2023 Board meeting, and was present for the Board's discussion, led by the Group Chairman, on the findings identified through IBE's review. Among other recommendations for consideration that could strengthen the end-toend governance of the Board and its committees, the Board focused on the following three specific themes:\n\n- -Effecting change: A need for greater focus was identified in relation to the prioritisation of execution, with clearer and more timely progress reporting to the Board, in particular around challenges faced.\n- -Board information: Reporting to the Board requires more succinct narrative and relevant key performance indicators.

This represented the culmination of considerable work by the Committee over a number of months.\n\nAs announced in December, David Nish confirmed his plans to retire from the Board at the conclusion of our AGM in May 2024. Brendan Nelson will succeed David as Chair of the Group Audit Committee with effect from 21 February 2024, and Ann Godbehere will succeed him as Senior Independent Director with effect from the conclusion of the 2024 AGM. On behalf of the Board, I want to take this opportunity to thank David for his significant commitment and contribution to HSBC, particularly in his role as Chair of the Group Audit Committee, and for the valuable counsel he has provided to the Board and to me personally. You can read more on the Committee's work on these appointments later in this report.\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities include:\n\n- -overseeing and monitoring the corporate governance framework of the Group and ensuring that this is consistent with best practice;\n- -overseeing succession planning and leading the process for identifying and nominating candidates for appointment to the Board and its committees; and\n- -overseeing succession planning and development for the Group Executive Committee and other senior executives.\n\nWe also welcomed Kalpana Morparia and Swee Lian Teo and, together with Ann and Brendan's appointments, I am confident that the changes to the composition of the Board over the past year have further strengthened its collective knowledge and experience required to oversee, challenge and support management.\n\nAs a result of the changes to the Board during 2023, our year-end 2023 target of at least 40% female representation was achieved. We are committed to maintaining this at or above 40% going forward. More broadly, we remain committed to ensuring the compositions of the Board and senior management reflect the wider workforce and communities in which we operate, and you can read more on our efforts this year on page 313.\n\nThe annual review of the performance of the Board and its committees is a critical part of ensuring that our governance practices are aligned with best practice and are working effectively. Independent Board Evaluation conducted the 2023 review for the Board and its committees, and its findings and agreed actions can be found on pages 260 to 261.\n\n\"I am confident that the changes to the composition of the Board over the past year have further strengthened the Board's collective knowledge and experience required to oversee, challenge and support management.\"\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\nChair\n\nNomination & Corporate Governance Committee",

        "page_content": "These actions included the decision to establish the Group Technology Committee, which was discussed by the Committee. Further information on this new Board-level committee is set out on page 252. In addition, the Committee reviewed the approach to the Group's governance of developing areas such as ESG and AI, and will continue to focus on whether these remain appropriate and forwardlooking as external standards and practices develop.\n\nThere have been numerous consultations issued over 2023, aimed at improving the effectiveness of the UK audit, governance and regulatory regimes. Given their potential impact, the Committee received updates on these and their potential implications on governance arrangements. The Committee also reviewed and provided input to the Group's responses to relevant consultations, including the Financial Reporting Council's ('FRC') consultation on proposed revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee continues to monitor potential future developments in the UK, Hong Kong and elsewhere to ensure that the impact of any proposed governance and regulatory changes on HSBC and its international operations is considered.\n\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of 2024, the Committee will look to oversee and enhance the succession pipeline at Board and senior management level, as well as efforts to deliver consistent standards of governance best practice across the Group.\n\nMark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\n## Committee governance\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, the Group Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Group Head of Talent routinely and selectively attended Committee meetings. The Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer attends all Committee meetings and supports the Group Chairman in ensuring that the Committee fulfils its governance responsibilities.\n\nRussell Reynolds Associates supported the Committee and the management team in relation to Board succession planning and appointments. It also provides support to management in relation to senior management succession, development and recruitment. It regularly and selectively attended meetings during the year, and has no other connection with the Group or members of the Board.\n\n## Appointment and re-election of Directors\n\nA rigorous selection process is followed for the appointment of Directors. Appointments are made on merit and candidates are considered against objective criteria, and with regard to the benefits of a diverse Board. Appointments are made in accordance with HSBC Holdings' Articles of Association.\n\nThe Board may at any time appoint any person as a Director or secretary, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional officer. The Board may appoint any Director or secretary to hold any employment or executive office and may revoke or terminate any such appointment.\n\nNon-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year term and, subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon an assessment by the Group Chairman and the Committee, are proposed for re-election by shareholders at each AGM. They typically serve two three-year terms, with any individual's appointment beyond six years to be for a rolling one-year term and subject to thorough review and challenge with reference to the needs of the Board. Where non-executive Directors are appointed beyond six years, an explanation will be provided in the Annual Report and Accounts .\n\nShareholders vote at each AGM on whether to elect and re-elect individual Directors. All Directors that stood for election and reelection at the 2023 AGM were elected and re-elected by shareholders.\n\n## Non-executive Director commitments\n\nThe terms and conditions of the appointments of non-executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment, which includes the expectations of them, and the estimated time required to perform their role. Letters of appointment of each non-executive Director are available for inspection at the registered office of HSBC Holdings.\n\nNon-executive Directors serving on the Board and as a member of any committees are expected to serve up to 75 days per annum. The Senior Independent Director is expected to serve an additional 30 days per annum. Those Directors who also chair a large committee are expected to commit up to 100 days per annum, with the Group Risk Committee Chair expected to commit up to 150 days per annum. Any additional time commitment required of non-executive Directors in connection with Board and committee activities is confirmed to them separately.\n\nBoard approval is required for any non-executive Director's external commitments, with consideration given to their total time commitments, potential conflicts of interest, and regulatory and investor expectations.",

        "page_content": "## Board composition and succession\n\nDuring 2023, the compositions of the Board and its committees were reviewed, with assessments focused on the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to oversee, challenge and support management in the achievement of the Group's strategic and business objectives. The assessments were focused on the Board, both collectively and as individual members. The Committee discussed succession planning for key roles on the Board and committees, including the roles of Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Group Audit Committee. The recruitment process for the new Directors provided an opportunity to add significant executive experience in banking. It also provided an opportunity to add deep business and cultural expertise across Asia that the Board had previously identified as a priority, and to meet our target for a woman to hold at least one of the senior Board positions by the end of 2025. In line with these objectives, a list of potential candidates was identified and considered by the Committee. Members of the Board, including the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer, met with potential candidates and their feedback helped inform the Committee's discussions and recommendations to the Board. The Board then approved the Committee's recommendations to appoint Kalpana Morparia with effect from 1 March 2023, Ann Godbehere and Brendan Nelson with effect from 1 September 2023, and Swee Lian Teo with effect from 1 October 2023.\n\nKalpana Morparia and Swee Lian Teo each bring significant banking, risk and regulatory experience in Asia. Ann's deep financial acumen and extensive financial services experience gained over a 30-year career, as well as her extensive large, public-listed company board experience as a non-executive director, makes her the right successor for the role of Senior Independent Director. Brendan's UK and international financial expertise and significant experience as statutory audit partner, and as audit committee chair at UK-listed companies, as well as previously being President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, will be particularly valuable in the leadership of the Group Audit Committee given the evolving audit, regulatory and disclosure environment in which the Group operates. Their biographies can be found on pages 239 to 243.\n\nFollowing the annual review of the Board skills matrix, the Committee remains focused on identifying candidates for future appointments with deep business and cultural expertise across Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor the market during 2024 for potential candidates for appointment to the Board in both the short and medium term, to ensure that the Board has a pipeline of credible successors.\n\nNeither Jackson Tai, who retired from the Board during the year, nor David Nish, who is not offering himself for re-election at the 2024 AGM, have raised concerns about the operation of the Board or the management of the company.\n\n## Committee composition\n\nAs part of the decision to establish the Group Technology Committee, when reviewing the Committee composition, it was agreed that Eileen Murray would be appointed as Chair, and Steven Guggenheimer, Kalpana Morparia, Swee Lian Teo and Brendan Nelson would be appointed as members of the Group Technology Committee with effect from 1 March 2024.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the composition of the Board committees more broadly to ensure that these remained appropriate and diverse, with consideration of the Board diversity and inclusion policy while utilising the respective skills and expertise of the Board members as set out in the Board skills matrix on page 247. As a result, and in addition to the appointments of members to the Group Technology Committee, it was agreed that Ann Godbehere would be appointed to the Group Audit Committee with effect from 21 February 2024.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of gender, social and ethnic diversity, and the benefits diversity brings to Board effectiveness. Diversity is taken into account when considering succession plans and appointments at both Board and senior management level, as well as more broadly across the Group. The Committee also considered the diversity and representation on Board committees when reviewing their composition.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Board had 47% female representation, with seven female Board members out of 15, ahead of the year-end 2025 target set by the FTSE Women Leaders Review. Ann Godbehere's appointment as Senior Independent Director will mean the Board achieves the FTSE Women Leaders Review target that at least one of the senior Board positions of Chair, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Independent Director or Chief Financial Officer is held by a woman. In accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the Board is on track to be compliant with these diversity targets and will be fully compliant with effect from the conclusion of the 2024 AGM. Beyond gender, the Board continues to exceed the Parker Review target of having at least one Director of ethnic heritage. However, given the international nature of our business, including our heritage in Asia, the Board has set a target to maintain or improve the current representation of Directors from a diverse ethnic heritage.\n\nThe Board's diversity and inclusion policy was updated in December 2023. The policy confirms our commitment to, and also details the approach to achieving, our diversity ambitions. Further details on activities to improve diversity across senior management and the wider workforce, together with representation statistics, can be found from page 76. The Board's diversity and inclusion policy is available on www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-and-governance/boardresponsibilities\n\n## Independence\n\nIndependence is a critical component of good corporate governance, and a principle that is applied consistently at both HSBC Holdings and subsidiary level. The Committee has delegated authority from the Board in relation to the assessment of the independence of nonexecutive Directors. In accordance with the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes, the Committee has reviewed and confirmed that all non-executive Directors who have submitted themselves for election and re-election at the AGM are considered to be independent. This conclusion was reached after consideration of all relevant circumstances that are likely to impair, or could appear to impair, independence.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code, the Committee also reviewed and considered the mechanisms in place to ensure independent views and input are available to the Board. These mechanisms include:\n\n- -having the appropriate Board and committee structure in place, including rules on the appointment and tenure of non-executive Directors;\n- -facilitating the option of having brokers and external industry experts in attendance at Board meetings during 2023, as well as having representatives from the Group's key regulators attend Board meetings in relation to specific regulatory items;\n- -ensuring non-executive Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to their personal responsibilities as a Director at the Group's expense;\n- -having terms of reference for each committee and the Board provide authority to engage independent professional advisers; and\n- -holding annual Board and committee effectiveness reviews, with feedback sought from members on the quality of, and access to, independent external advice.",

        "page_content": "## Senior executive succession and development\n\nFollowing Georges Elhedery's appointment as Group Chief Financial Officer from 1 January 2023, the Committee monitored and received updates on his induction plan.\n\nThe succession plans for the Group Executive Committee members were approved by the Committee in December 2023. These reflect continued efforts to support the development and progression of diverse talent and promote the long-term success of the Group, with the gender diversity and proportion of Asian heritage successors improving year on year. The approval of succession plans included future internal and external succession options for the Group Chief Executive, to ensure that the Committee has a robust and actionable plan when required. The Committee also reviewed longer-term internal succession options for the Group Chief Executive to enable the Committee to interact more frequently with high potential and diverse talent in the Group.\n\nThe Committee continued to receive updates on the development of our talent programme within the Asia-Pacific region. Since its launch in 2020, significant progress has been made towards ensuring that we have a deeper and more diverse leadership bench-strength. Succession plans are more robust, with greater diversity and good succession fulfilment outcomes.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees, including the Committee, was conducted externally by Independent Board Evaluation for 2023. It determined that the Committee continued to operate effectively, with no specific actions identified for the Committee. Positive feedback was received on the effectiveness of the recruitment processes of new Board members and the succession planning for senior management.\n\nFurther details of the annual review of the Board and committee effectiveness can be found on pages 260 to 261.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nIn line with the subsidiary accountability framework, the Committee continued to oversee the corporate governance and succession arrangements across the principal and material subsidiary portfolio. The Committee also reviewed the succession plans for the principal subsidiary chairs to ensure future successors had the necessary skills and experience to effectively oversee and monitor delivery of the Group's strategic and business priorities within their territory, in accordance with the Group's governance expectations.\n\nWhere a subsidiary was unable to fully comply with the subsidiary accountability framework, the Committee endorsed exceptions, where appropriate, subject to strong rationale, including consideration of local laws and regulations and market practice. Endorsement requests were also subject to thorough review and consideration by the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer in advance of consideration by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee reviewed succession plans and oversaw compliance with the Group's governance expectations of principal and material subsidiaries. The overall quality of succession plans has improved markedly over the past three years, with plans demonstrating a clear focus on strengthening boards' overall diversity and experience, in line with strategic and business objectives.\n\nThe Committee continued to support and seek opportunities to enhance subsidiary connectivity, including through the Chairman's Forum and Remuneration Committee Chairs' Forum, which regularly brought together the chairs of the principal subsidiaries to discuss common issues, and the Non-Executive Director Summit which brought over 100 non-executive Directors together in Hong Kong in May 2023.\n\nSubsidiaries also provided opportunities for internal talent to serve on their boards, following the training that they received through the HSBC Bank Director Programme. The Committee continues to support and look for opportunities to enhance subsidiary connectivity through Non-Executive Director Summits and other engagement forums.\n\n## Matters considered during 2023\n\n|                                                                      | Jan   | Feb   | Mar   | Apr   | May   | Jun   | Jul   | Sep   | Dec   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Board composition and succession                                     |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Board composition, including succession planning and skills matrices | l     | l     | l     | l     | l     | l     | l     | l     | l     |\n| Approval of diversity and inclusion policy                           | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     |\n| Executive talent and development                                     |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Senior executive succession                                          | l     | l     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     | l     | l     | l     |\n| Approval of executive succession plans                               | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     |\n| Governance                                                           |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Board and committee evaluation                                       | l     | \u00f4     | l     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     |\n| Subsidiary governance                                                | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     | \u00f4     | l     | l     | l     |\n| Subsidiary and executive appointments                                | l     | l     | \u00f4     | \u00f4     | l     | \u00f4     | l     | \u00f4     | l     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatter considered\n\n\u00f4\n\nMatter not considered\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will continue to be a priority going ahead due to the need for a robust control environment given the ongoing the volume of regulatory- and strategy-driven change across the Group. This included oversight of regulatory and accounting deliverables, such as the enhancement of Finance systems and controls and the progress in the implementation of Basel III.\n\nSignificant time was also spent at GAC meetings on the positioning and forward-looking financial guidance provided to the market as part of our financial reporting for both the current and prior year, notably in relation to returns, costs and expected credit losses ('ECL'), including those associated with the Group's exposure to the China corporate real estate market.\n\nGiven the uncertain external environment, as well as HSBC's growth ambitions, the GAC will continue to play an important role in monitoring the effectiveness of the control environment in supporting sustainability of these ambitions.\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities include:\n\n- -monitoring and assessing the integrity of the financial statements, formal announcements and regulatory information in relation to the Group's financial performance, as well as significant accounting judgements;\n- -reviewing the effectiveness of, and ensuring that management has appropriate internal controls over, financial reporting;\n- -reviewing management's arrangements for compliance with prudential regulatory financial reporting;\n- -reviewing and monitoring the relationship with the external auditor and overseeing its appointment, remuneration and independence;\n- -overseeing the Group's policies, procedures and arrangements for capturing and responding to whistleblower concerns and ensuring they are operating effectively; and\n- -overseeing the work of Global Internal Audit and monitoring and assessing the effectiveness, performance, resourcing, independence and standing of the function.\n\nThe GAC continued to strengthen our relationships and understanding of issues at the local level through regular information sharing with the principal subsidiary audit committee chairs. This was supplemented with regular meetings with the chairs to discuss key issues, and through their periodic attendance at GAC meetings. I also joined a number of principal subsidiary audit committee meetings throughout the year, which supported connectivity and information flows across the Group.\n\nThe Group's whistleblowing arrangements continue to satisfy regulatory obligations. I regularly met the whistleblowing team to discuss material whistleblowing cases, and the progress made in enhancing the Group's whistleblowing arrangements.\n\nThe GAC's performance and effectiveness were reviewed as part of the Board effectiveness review undertaken during the year. I was pleased that the review concluded that the GAC continued to operate effectively, with no material areas for improvement identified.\n\nFinally, as announced on 6 December, Brendan Nelson will succeed me as Chair of the GAC following the publication of HSBC's Annual Report and Accounts 2023 on 21 February 2024. The Board has determined that Brendan's previous experience, notably as audit chair at NatWest and bp, makes him ideally suited to chair the GAC.\n\n## David Nish\n\nChair of the Group Audit Committee\n\n\"Given the uncertain external environment, as well as HSBC's growth ambitions, the GAC will continue to play an important role in monitoring the effectiveness of the control environment.\"\n\n## David Nish\n\nChair\n\nGroup Audit Committee",

The Committee Chair reports on the key matters and discussions at the subsequent Board meeting, and the Board also receives copies of the Committee agendas and minutes. This supports the Board's oversight of the work carried out by management, Global Internal Audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC'), as the Group's statutory auditor.\n\nThe Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee has confirmed that each member of the Committee is independent according to the criteria from the US Securities and Exchange Commission; and the Committee and individual members continue to possess competence relevant to the banking and broader financial services sector in which the Group operates. The Board has determined that David Nish, Brendan Nelson and Eileen Murray are the audit committee 'financial experts' for the purposes of section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes.\n\nThe Committee Chair continued to engage with various key stakeholders, including regulators such as the UK's PRA and the Financial Reporting Council, to understand their views, key themes and areas of focus within the broader financial services sector. These included trilateral meetings involving the Group's external auditor, PwC, and the PRA.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, Global Financial Controller, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer and other members of senior management routinely attended meetings of the GAC. The external auditor attended all meetings.\n\nThe Chair holds regular meetings with management, Global Internal Audit and PwC, as the external auditor, to discuss relevant items as they had arisen during the year outside the formal Committee process. The Committee also regularly meets with the internal and external auditors, without management present. Private discussions are also held with relevant members of senior management, including the Group Chief Financial Officer and Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer.\n\n## Matters considered during

considered\n\n- \u00f4 Matter not considered\n\n## How the Committee discharged its responsibilities\n\n## Financial, ESG and climate reporting\n\nThe GAC is responsible for reviewing the Group's financial reporting during the year, including the Annual Report and Accounts , Interim Report , quarterly earnings releases, analyst presentations and Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\nFurthermore, as an area of expanded assurance, the GAC, supported by the executive-level ESG Committee, provided close oversight of the disclosure risks in relation to ESG and climate reporting, amid rising stakeholder expectations.\n\nAs part of its review, the GAC:\n\n- -reviewed the narrative commentary on our financial and nonfinancial performance to ensure it remained fair, balanced and understandable;\n- -challenged and evaluated management's application of critical accounting policies and material areas in which significant accounting judgements were applied;\n- -gave particular regard to the analysis and measurement of IFRS 9 ECL, including the key judgements and management adjustments made in relation to the forward economic guidance, underlying economic scenarios and reasonableness of the weightings, as well as modelling and adjustments;\n- -focused on preparation for disclosures to ensure these were consistent, appropriate and acceptable under the relevant financial and governance reporting requirements;",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Directors | Corporate governance report | Board committees\n\n- -tracked and monitored developments relating to the strategy and scope of ESG and climate disclosures, in particular the assurance related to the Group's net zero transition plan, which was published at the end of January 2024. The GAC also focused on internal and external assurance within ESG reporting in line with wider market developments to ensure ESG and climate disclosures were materially accurate and consistent;\n- -tracked and monitored the delivery against the external audit plan;\n- -provided advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying the long-term viability statement; and\n- -considered the key performance metrics related to strategic priorities, and ensured that the performance and outlook statements reflected the risks and uncertainties appropriately.\n\nIn addition to its work on the Group's financial disclosures, PwC also provided limited standalone assurance on the Group's climate reporting. Further details can be found in 'Assurance relating to ESG data' on page 43.\n\nIn conjunction with the GRC, the GAC considered the current position of the Group, along with the emerging and principal risks, and carried out a robust assessment of the Group's prospects. This assessment informed the GAC's recommendation to the Board on the Group's long-term viability. The GAC also undertook a detailed review before recommending to the Board that the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual and interim financial statements. Further details can be found on page 40.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nFollowing review and challenge of the disclosures, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Annual Report and Accounts , taken as a whole, were fair, balanced and understandable. These provided the shareholders with the necessary information to assess the Group's position and performance, business model, strategy and risks facing the business, including in relation to the increasingly important ESG considerations.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the draft Annual Report and Accounts 2023 and results announcements to provide feedback and challenge to management. It was supported by the work of the Group Disclosure and Controls Committee, which also reviewed and assessed the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 and investor communications.\n\nThis work enables the GAC to discharge its responsibilities and support the Board in making the statement required under the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nRegular updates and confirmations are provided to the GAC on the action management takes to remediate any failings or weaknesses identified through the operation of the Group's framework of internal financial controls. This is supplemented by reviews of these controls by the second line of defence and internal audit, and the external auditors, who provided additional comfort to the Committee on the effectiveness of these controls. These reviews confirmed that there were no material weaknesses as at the year-end.\n\nThese updates included the Group's work on compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on this work, the GAC recommended that the Board support its assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nThe GAC continues to focus on controls over the Group's insurance business following the implementation of the IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' accounting standards. This will remain a focus through 2024, with the GAC scheduled to receive further updates on the control environment for this business and in relation to the change programme more generally through the first half of 2024.\n\nFor further details of how the Board reviewed the effectiveness of key aspects of internal control, see page 311.\n\n## Regulatory reporting\n\nRegulatory reporting has been a key priority for the Committee over recent years, and will continue to be a priority for 2024. The Committee is focused on monitoring the programme of work to address the quality and reliability of regulatory reporting to meet regulatory expectations.\n\nThe Committee approved the Integrity of Regulatory Reporting programme, management's strategy for remediation of deficiencies in relation to the Group's regulatory reporting governance, process and controls. The Committee also provided oversight of the Group's engagement with PRA-requested skilled-persons reviews including the initiation of a review of the sustainability of the Group's ongoing remediation efforts for regulatory reporting, which commenced in 2023 for an initial period to 31 December 2025. Regular updates will be provided to the Committee by the skilled person throughout the course of their review.\n\nManagement provided updates on the status of ongoing HSBCspecific external reviews, and discussed the issues and themes identified from the increased assurance work and focus on regulatory reporting. The GAC also discussed root cause themes, remediation of known issues and new issues identified through the increased assurance work and focus on regulatory reporting. The Committee challenged management on remediation plans, to ensure there was a sustainable reduction in issues and that dependencies with other key programmes were well understood.\n\nThe Committee Chair initiated a schedule under which certain principal subsidiary audit committee chairs, chief executive officers and chief financial officers attended GAC meetings to share progress and learnings in relation to their local remediation efforts.\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Principal activities and significant issues considered during 2023' table on page 271.\n\n## Adequacy of resources\n\nThe Committee is responsible, under the Hong Kong Listing Rules, to annually assess the adequacy of resources of the accounting, internal audit, financial reporting and ESG performance and reporting functions. It also monitored the legal and regulatory environment relevant to its responsibilities.\n\nThe Committee determined that each of the functions provided thorough information with regards to people capacity and capability and endorsed the annual update to the Board.\n\nIn recognition that the enhancement of the Group's regulatory reporting processes and controls was a priority for both the Committee and the Group's regulators, the GAC also considered the adequacy of regulatory reporting resources as part of the year-end activities.\n\n## Connectivity with principal subsidiary audit committees\n\nThe Committee recognises the importance of strong connectivity and alignment with principal subsidiary audit committees. The mechanisms to support this are well established and continued to operate effectively during the year.\n\nThis included information sharing and targeted collaboration between audit committee chairs and management to ensure there was appropriate focus on the local implementation of programmes. During 2023 this included a particular focus on regulatory reporting, with the subsidiary audit committee chairs, chief executive officers and chief financial officers, attending Committee meetings to update on progress, share local challenges, and areas of focus with the Committee.\n\nIn addition to the Chair's regular meetings with the audit chairs of the Group's UK, European, US and Asian principal subsidiaries, and their attendance at Committee meetings for reference items, escalations were received by the Committee for its information and action.\n\nOn a half-year basis, principal subsidiary audit committees provided certifications to the GAC that regarded the preparation of their financial statements, adherence to Group policies and escalation of any issues that required the attention of the GAC. These certifications also included information regarding the governance, review and assurance activities undertaken by principal subsidiary audit committees in relation to prudential regulatory reporting.\n\n## External auditor\n\nThe GAC has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the Group's external auditor, PwC. The GAC undertook a formal competitive tender process for the Group's statutory audit during 2022 following PwC's appointment for the Annual Report and",

        "page_content": "Accounts 2015 . This process concluded that PwC would remain as the statutory auditor, which was announced in January 2023. As part of the tender process, PwC committed to a number of initiatives to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Group audit, and progress against these is reported to the Committee on a regular basis to allow these to be monitored.\n\nPwC completed its ninth audit, providing robust challenge to management and sound independent advice to the Committee on specific financial reporting judgements and the control environment. The senior audit partner is Scott Berryman who has been in the role since 2019. It was announced during 2023 that Matthew Falconer would become the senior audit partner from 2024 as part of the rotation of auditors. The Committee reviewed the external auditor's approach and strategy for the annual audit and received regular updates on the audit, including observations on the control environment. Key audit matters discussed with PwC are set out in its report on page 318.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Financial Reporting Council's ('FRC') Audit Committee and the External Audit: Minimum Standard ('the Standard') during 2023, the Committee confirmed that all requirements of the standard have been complied with.\n\n## External audit plan\n\nThe GAC reviewed the PwC external audit approach, including the materiality, risk assessment and scope of the audit. PwC highlighted the changes being made to its approach to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the audit. PwC's plan supports its, and the GAC's, focus on audit quality through standardisation, centralisation and the use of technology. The GAC has questioned PwC on its plans to utilise more digital solutions on the HSBC audit, and updates on this will be provided through 2024.\n\n## Effectiveness of external audit process\n\nThe GAC assessed the effectiveness of PwC as the Group's external auditor, using a questionnaire that focused on the overall audit process, its effectiveness and the quality of output.\n\nIn addition, the GAC Chair, certain principal subsidiary audit chairs and members of the Group Executive Committee met with the  Senior Audit Partner to discuss findings from the questionnaire and provide in-depth feedback on the interaction with the PwC audit team.\n\nPwC highlighted the actions being taken in response to the HSBC effectiveness review, including the development of audit quality indicators. These provide a balanced scorecard and transparent reporting to the GAC on the work of both HSBC teams and PwC during the course of the audit. These audit quality indicators focused on the following areas:\n\n- -findings from inspections across the Group and regulators on PwC as a firm;\n- -the hours of audit work delivered by senior PwC audit team members, the extent of specialist and expert involvement, delivery against agreed timetable and milestones and the use of technology;\n- -any new control deficiencies in Sarbanes-Oxley locations, proportion of management identified deficiencies and delivery of audit deliverables to agreed timelines; and\n- -matters occurring in PwC's global network that could be relevant to the audit of HSBC.\n\nSpecifically in 2023, PwC reported to the GAC on the recommended actions taken in response to the independent review of governance, culture and accountability that was undertaken by Dr Ziggy Switkowski AO, as well as further detail on audit quality controls across PwC's global operations.\n\nThe GAC receives regular updates from PwC and management on performance across the audit quality indicators, which provides wider visibility of ongoing and emerging issues. The GAC requested that these indicators included metrics in relation to PwC's IT security, reflecting the significant volume of information that is shared between HSBC and PwC as part of the audit activity.\n\nThere were no breaches of the policy on hiring employees or former employees of the external auditor during the year. The external auditor attended all Committee meetings and the GAC Chair maintains regular contact with the senior audit partner and his team throughout the year.\n\nThe FRC's Quality Review team routinely monitors the quality of the audit work of certain UK audit firms through inspections of sample audits and related quality processes. PwC was reviewed on the audit of our financial reporting for the 2022 financial year. The Chair had discussions with the FRC as part of the process, and also discussed the outcome of the inspection with the Senior Audit Partner and the other members of the Committee. The Committee was pleased with the outcome of the inspection, which reported no key findings as well as a number of specific examples of good audit practice.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nThe Committee assessed any potential threats to independence that were self-identified or reported by PwC. The GAC considered PwC to be independent and PwC, in accordance with professional ethical standards and applicable rules and regulations, provided the GAC with written confirmation of its independence for the duration of 2023.\n\nThe Committee confirms it has complied with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the financial statements.\n\nFollowing the recommendation to reappoint PwC as the auditor, the associated resolutions concerning the reappointment and the audit fee for 2023 were approved at the 2023 AGM by the shareholders of the Group.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for setting, reviewing and monitoring the appropriateness of the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. It also applies the Group's policy on the award of non-audit services to the external auditor. The non-audit services are carried out in accordance with the external auditor independence policy to ensure that services do not create a conflict of interest. All non-audit services are either approved by the GAC, or by Group Finance when acting within delegated limits and criteria set by the GAC.\n\nThe non-audit services carried out by PwC included 64 engagements approved during the year where the fees were over $100,000 but less than $1m. Global Finance, as a delegate of the GAC, considered that it was in the best interests of the Group to use PwC for these services because they were:\n\n- -audit-related engagements that were largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team, with the work closely related to the work performed in the audit;\n- -engagements covered under other assurance services that require obtaining appropriate audit evidence to express a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other than the responsible party about the subject matter information;\n- -other permitted services such as advisory attestation reports on internal controls of a service organisation primarily prepared for and used by third-party end users; or\n- -required or permitted by local regulators to be performed by the external auditor.\n\nEight engagements during the year were approved where the fees exceeded $1m. These were mainly engagements required by the regulator and incremental fees related to previously approved engagements, including the provision of independent assurance reports on global controls for 2023.\n\n| Auditors' remuneration                  | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total fees payable                      | 155.9     | 148.1     |\n| of which fees for non-audit services    | 46.1      | 50.5      |\n| Ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees 1 | 42.0%     | 51.7%     |",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Directors | Corporate governance report | Board committees\n\n## Whistleblowing and speak-up culture\n\nAn important part of HSBC's values is speaking up when something does not feel right. HSBC remains committed to ensuring colleagues have confidence to speak up and acting when they do. A wide variety of channels are provided for colleagues to raise concerns, including the Group's whistleblowing channel, HSBC Confidential (see page 94 for further information).\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility to the GAC to oversee the effectiveness of HSBC's whistleblowing procedures. The Chair of the GAC is a Group Senior Manager (SMF7), and has a prescribed responsibility as the whistleblowers' champion, to ensure integrity of HSBC's policies on whistleblowing and protecting those who report concerns. As part of his responsibility, the GAC Chair reports to the Board on the GAC's oversight of whistleblowing as part of his regular reporting updates.\n\nThe Group Head of Regulatory Compliance regularly updates the GAC on whistleblowing effectiveness, including controls assessments and internal audit findings. The Committee is briefed on culture and conduct risks from whistleblowing cases and actions taken.\n\nIn 2023, the GAC received updates on topics such as cultural insights from internal HR-led investigations relating to matters reported through HSBC Confidential. Reports were also provided on the actions taken to support different functional areas collaborate postinvestigation. The Chair met with the Group Head of Conduct, Policy and Whistleblowing for briefings on significant whistleblowing matters. In 2024, the GAC will continue to receive briefings on these actions and the ongoing efficiency of the HSBC Confidential channel.\n\n## Global Internal Audit\n\nThe primary role of the Global Internal Audit function is to help the Board and management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Global Internal Audit does this by providing independent and objective assurance on the design and operating effectiveness of the Group's governance, risk management and control framework and processes, prioritising the greatest areas of risk. The independence of Global Internal Audit from day-to-day line management responsibility is critical to its ability to deliver objective audit coverage by maintaining an independent and objective stance. Global Internal Audit is free from interference by any element in the organisation, including on matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or internal audit report content. The Group Head of Internal Audit reports to, and meets frequently with, the Chair of the GAC. In addition, in 2023, there was more interaction between Global Internal Audit senior management and the members of the GAC, aimed at increasing knowledge and awareness of the audit universe and existing and emerging risks identified by Global Internal Audit. Global Internal Audit adheres to The Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance.\n\nConsistent with previous years, the 2024 audit planning process includes assessing the inherent risks and strength of the control environment across the audit entities representing the Group. Results\n\nof this assessment are combined with a top-down analysis of risk themes by risk category to ensure that themes identified are addressed in the annual plan. Audit coverage is achieved using a combination of business and functional audits of processes and controls, risk management frameworks and major change initiatives, as well as regulatory audits, investigations and special reviews. In addition to the ongoing importance of regulatory-focused work, key risk theme categories for 2024 audit coverage remain as: strategy, governance and culture; financial crime, conduct and compliance; financial resilience; and operational resilience. A quarterly continuous monitoring assessment of key risk themes will form the basis of thematic reporting and plan updates and will ultimately drive the 2025 planning process.\n\nIn 2024, Global Internal Audit's new or heightened areas of coverage are: transformation including regulatory change; people capacity and capability; ESG; material regulatory obligations; Consumer Duty implementation; retail and wholesale credit risk management; Basel III; regulatory reporting; treasury; operational resilience; enterprise-wide risk management; model risk management; machine learning and artificial intelligence; data management and technology. In addition, Global Internal Audit will continue its programme of culture audits to assess the extent that behaviours reflect HSBC's purpose, ambition, values and strategy, and expand its coverage of franchise audits for locally significant countries. The annual audit plan and material plan updates made in response to changes in the Group's structure and risk profile are approved by the GAC.\n\nThe results of audit work, together with an assessment of the Group's overall governance, risk management and control framework and processes are reported to the GAC, GRC and local audit and risk committees, as appropriate. This reporting highlights key themes identified through audit activity, and the output from continuous monitoring. This includes business and regulatory developments and an independent view of emerging and horizon risk, together with details of audit coverage and any required changes to the annual audit plan. Based on regular internal audit reporting to the GAC, private sessions with the Group Head of Internal Audit, the Global Professional Practices annual assessment and quarterly quality assurance updates, the GAC is satisfied with the effectiveness of the Global Internal Audit function and the appropriateness of its resources.\n\nExecutive management is accountable for addressing the matters raised by Global Internal Audit, which must be addressed within an appropriate and agreed timetable. Confirmation to this effect must be provided to Global Internal Audit, which validates closure on a risk basis.\n\nGlobal Internal Audit maintains a close working relationship with HSBC's external auditor, PwC. The external auditor is kept informed of Global Internal Audit's activities and results, and is afforded free access to all internal audit reports and supporting records.",

The review determined that the GAC continued to operate effectively.\n\nPositive feedback was noted on the leadership of the Committee Chair, the composition of the Committee and the focus and balance of time dedicated to discussion at Committee meetings. The review highlighted the continued importance of strong interaction between the GAC, GRC, Technology Governance Working Group and the Board, on key issues including ESG.\n\nFurther details of the annual review of the Board and Committee effectiveness can be found on pages 260 to 261.\n\n## Committee priorities\n\nAt its meeting in December 2023, the Committee agreed a number of priorities for 2024. These included:\n\n- -Regulatory reporting: Given the criticality of accurate and timely regulatory reporting to the Group's licence to operate, the Committee will have a key focus on delivery of the Integrity of Regulatory Reporting  programme during 2024.\n- -ESG: As competent authorities in the markets in which the Group operates launch market-specific disclosure requirements under new regulation, the Committee will continue to focus on the assurance of reporting and disclosure at both a Group and subsidiary level, as well as the effectiveness of the supporting control environment and governance.\n- -Data: The Committee plans to monitor and provide input into the data strategy, remediation, and controls for the purposes of financial and regulatory reporting, including that data management strategies are embedded across the Group.",

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Jackson Tai for his service to GRC, and the Group more broadly, prior to stepping down as Committee Chair.

Commercial real estate in both the US and Asia also came under increasing pressure due to the high interest rate environment, inflationary trends and recessionary concerns. Central banks' efforts to lower inflation by rapidly raising interest rates also had a wide-ranging impact on retail borrowers as the cost of living increased globally. The GRC has closely monitored the Group's credit exposures, market risk and settlement limits in response to these events, and has endorsed management's proactive execution in reducing high risk exposures and accelerating portfolio transformation.\n\nOversight of financial risks has been critical against this external backdrop, and the GRC has paid close focus to the Group's ongoing treasury, capital and liquidity risk management activities, including early warning indicators, delivery of the interest rate risk in the\n\nThe GRC has overall non-executive responsibility for the oversight of risk-related matters and the risks impacting the Group. The GRC's key responsibilities include:\n\n- -overseeing and advising the Board on all risk-related matters, including financial and non-financial risks;\n- -advising the Board on risk appetite-related matters, and key regulatory submissions;\n- -reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management framework and internal controls systems (other than internal financial controls overseen by the GAC);\n- -reviewing and challenging the Group's stress testing exercises; and\n- -overseeing the Group's approach to conduct, fairness and preventing financial crime.\n\nbanking book strategy, prudential sensitivity analysis and capital and liquidity adequacy. Throughout the year, the GRC reviewed and challenged management on the Group's regulatory submissions, including the Bank of England's requirements for the Resolvability Assessment Framework, internal capital adequacy assessment process ('ICAAP') and internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ('ILAAP'). The GRC had primary non-executive responsibility for reviewing the outcomes of regulatory stress tests, including the 2023 annual cyclical scenario hybrid mortgage models update and the postwind-down business restructuring analysis.\n\nNon-financial risks were also a key focus of the GRC in 2023.  The GRC carefully considered the Group's regulatory remediation and change programmes, and worked closely with management to better prioritise and understand where there are key interdependencies. In particular, the Committee reviewed and challenged the Group's data strategy and other key areas of regulatory focus, including oversight of the operational resilience enhancements, conduct and financial crime, technology and cyber risk. The GRC also provided oversight and support to risk transformation activities to develop stronger risk management capabilities and outcomes across the Group. Climate also continues to be a priority area of oversight with regular reports on areas of risk, such as greenwashing, compliance with regulatory requirements, and ESG policy changes.\n\nFurther details on these and other areas of GRC oversight during the year are set out below.\n\n\"The Committee takes continuous and active steps to safeguard the Group's capital and liquidity positions, keeping it secure in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, enabling it to effectively deploy capital dynamically to take advantage of opportunities\"\n\n## James Forese\n\n## Chair\n\nGroup Risk Committee",

The Committee also met with the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and Risk and Compliance Executive Committee members in October 2023 to review matters relating to risk transformation, wholesale credit risk, treasury risk, model risk, operational risk, data and climate risk.\n\n## How the Committee discharged its responsibilities\n\n## Activities outside formal meetings\n\nThe GRC held a number of meetings outside its regular schedule to facilitate deeper and more effective oversight of the risks impacting the Group. Areas covered included capital management, stress testing, ICAAP and ILAAP preparations, as well as briefings on the Resolvability Assessment Framework. Further details of these sessions are included in the 'Principal activities and significant issues considered during 2023' table starting on page 276.\n\n## Connectivity with principal subsidiary risk committees\n\nDuring 2023, the GRC continued to actively engage with principal subsidiary risk committees through the scheduled participation of principal subsidiary risk committee chairs at relevant GRC meetings, and through a quarterly connectivity meeting with the principal subsidiary risk committee chairs. This meeting is also attended by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. This participation and connectivity promoted the sharing of information and best practices between the GRC and principal subsidiary risk committees.\n\nThe GRC also received reports at its regular meetings on the key risks facing principal subsidiaries including escalations and certifications from the principal subsidiary risk committees. The certifications confirmed that the principal subsidiary risk committees had challenged management on the quality of the information provided, reviewed the actions proposed by management to address any emerging issues and that risk management and internal control systems had been operating effectively.\n\nThese interactions furthered the GRC's understanding of the risk profile of the principal subsidiaries, leading to more comprehensive review and challenge by the GRC.\n\n## Engagement with the Risk and Compliance Executive Committee\n\nDuring 2023, the GRC met with the Risk and Compliance Executive Committee to promote information sharing, meet and assess the Group Risk and Compliance function leadership team, and encourage active engagement with executive management.\n\nDuring the engagement meeting, the GRC developed a better understanding of the efforts to strengthen our capabilities across the Group Risk and Compliance function. There were also in-depth discussions on the progress and remediation of key regulatory concerns. The engagement promoted a healthy working relationship between GRC members and executive management.\n\n## Collaborative oversight by the GRC, GAC and Technology Governance Working Group\n\nThe GRC worked closely with the GAC and the Technology Governance Working Group to address any areas of significant overlap, and to oversee risk more comprehensively through intercommittee communications and joint meetings.\n\nThe GRC, GAC and the Technology Governance Working Group Chairs convened on two occasions to consider the Group's data strategy and ambitions. Further details of these sessions can be found under 'Collaboration with GAC/GRC/Technology Governance Working Group' in the GAC report on page  271.\n\nThe committees and working group worked closely to ensure appropriate alignment in the review, discussion, challenge and conclusions on topics including risk and control issues relating to digital assets and currencies, and the transition of core Finance capabilities to the Cloud. This ensured that the committees benefited from each other's expertise and challenge.\n\nCoordination between the GRC, GAC and the Technology Governance Working Group is supported by cross-membership. The GRC and GAC Chairs are members of both committees, and this strengthened connectivity and the flow of information between the committees. Each of the co-chairs of the Technology Governance Working Group are members of the GRC and GAC, respectively.",

The GRC oversaw the progress in achieving our model risk vision, strengthening  our model risk management capabilities and addressing regulatory requirements  across global jurisdictions. In particular, the GRC reviewed the PRA Supervisory  Statement 1/23 and the impact on the Group. The GRC reviewed the new  guidance, potential resource implications and the planned programme of changes  across all three lines of defence. It also noted the enhanced governance  expectations in relation to model oversight. | Model risk   |\n| Environmental, social and governance risks  present significant risks to organisations both in  terms of their own operations and how they  engage with stakeholders and communities.                                                | The GRC remained focused on climate risk and greenwashing risk.

The GRC approved the 2023 internal climate scenario analysis and nature scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Climate risk |\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\n## 2022/2023\n\nDuring 2023, the GRC implemented the recommendations of the 2022 committee evaluation conducted by Lintstock in consultation with the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer and Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. This included the need for continued focus on the quality of reporting, the importance of focusing limited agenda time to the most critical issues, and further clarity in roles and coordination between the GRC and other Board committees. The outcomes of the evaluation were reported to the Board, and progress was tracked by the GRC through the year.\n\n## 2023/2024\n\nDuring the year, the annual review of the effectiveness of the Board committees, including the GRC, was conducted externally by Independent Board Evaluation. The review determined that the GRC continued to operate effectively.\n\nAreas for enhancement were identified, including the need for: increased focus on the most significant enterprise risks recognising the breadth of the risk agenda; continued close engagement with subsidiaries; and enhancement of induction programmes for new members given the complexity of much of the subject matter under discussion. A review of escalation parameters and filters will also be undertaken by the GRC in 2024.\n\nThe outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the GRC will track progress in implementing recommendations during 2024.\n\nFurther details of the annual review of effectiveness can be found on pages 260 to 261.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor progress to deliver enhancements in response to feedback from the evaluations in 2024.\n\n## Focus of future activities\n\nThe GRC's focus for 2024 will include the following activities:\n\n- -oversee risk transformation activities to develop even stronger risk management capabilities, including the continued enhancement of the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework, especially in light of continued geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds;\n- -continue to assess the Group's operational resilience capability and the implementation of enhancements to the operating model;\n- -continue to oversee treasury risk to strengthen our capital and liquidity management capabilities;\n- -monitor delivery against our climate ambitions and the development of appropriate data and model management tools and capabilities;\n- -continue the oversight of recovery and resolution planning activities to assess our resolvability capabilities if such situation arises;\n- -continue the oversight of the delivery of technology-related programmes including the data remediation programme, and enhancement of the Group's IT systems/platform;\n- -continue to oversee financial crime risk and the strengthening of the financial crime control framework, including proactive management by the business; and\n- -assess our strategic opportunities and risks including exposures to digital currencies or assets and use of timely application of technology such as machine learning or artificial intelligence.",

Disclosures marked as audited should be considered audited in the context of financial statements taken as a whole.\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nI am delighted to present our 2023 Directors' remuneration report on behalf of the members of the Group Remuneration Committee.\n\nI would like to thank Jamie Forese for the counsel he provided to us all as a member of the Group Remuneration Committee. We welcomed Eileen Murray and Ann Godbehere as members. They have already made valuable contributions since their respective appointments in 2023.\n\n2023 was a year of good performance and positive progress for the Group. Our colleagues were critical to delivering those outcomes, remaining committed to serving our customers and clients around the world. Against that backdrop, the Committee's focus in 2023 was on ensuring we deliver an exceptional experience to colleagues. This is crucial to attract, retain and energise the people we need to sustain our performance and grow in markets that are highly competitive.\n\nWe also spent considerable time in 2023 thinking about executive Director remuneration, in the context of our strategy, performance and the removal of the 2:1 UK regulatory cap between variable and fixed pay. We have started to consider policy options ahead of the renewal of the Directors' remuneration policy in 2025.\n\nThe Committee reflected on feedback from investors following the vote on the implementation of our current policy at the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') in 2023, which received 79.75% of votes cast in favour.\n\nWe explained in our statements of 5 May 2023 and 3 November 2023 that our largest shareholder voted against the Board's recommendations on a number of resolutions including the Directors' remuneration report, which impacted the voting results on these resolutions. The Board was pleased that a large majority of shareholders voting at the AGM supported HSBC's approach. I have met with several of our large institutional investors and proxy advisory firms since the AGM, and there remains strong support for our current Directors' remuneration policy.\n\nWe will continue to engage with our major shareholders and listen to their views as we develop the Directors' remuneration policy next year.\n\n## Performance in 2023\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur financial performance in 2023 reflected the strength of our balance sheet in a higher interest rate environment and the good progress made executing our strategy over the last four years.\n\nWe delivered a reported profit before tax of $30.3bn, which was up $13.3bn compared with 2022. This included a favourable year-on-year impact of $2.5bn relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and a provisional gain of $1.6bn recognised on the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited ('SVB UK'), which were partly offset by the recognition of a $3.0bn impairment charge relating to the investment in our associate, Bank of Communications Co., Limited ('BoCom').\n\nReported revenue of $66.1bn grew by 30% or $15.4bn compared with 2022, due to good performance by all three businesses reflecting higher net interest income from interest rate rises.\n\nReported costs fell by 2% to $32.1bn, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of restructuring and other related costs. On our cost target basis, 2023 costs grew by 6% versus our target of approximately 3% compared with 2022.\n\nOur return on average tangible equity ('RoTE') for 2023 was 14.6%, compared with 10.0% in 2022. Excluding strategic transactions and the BoCom impairment, our RoTE was 15.6%.\n\nThis performance together with our 50% payout ratio commitment for 2023 (excluding material notable items and related impacts) enables us to approve a full year dividend of $0.61 per share.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities include:\n\n- -making recommendations to the Board, for approval by shareholders, on the Group's remuneration policy;\n- -setting the overarching principles, parameters and governance framework of the Group's remuneration policy;\n- -approving the remuneration of executive Directors and other senior Group employees; and\n- -regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the remuneration policy of the Group and its subsidiaries in the context of consistent and effective risk management.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic performance\n\nIn 2023, there was further good progress in executing our strategy across the four strategic pillars aligned to our purpose, values and ambition. The completion of the sale of our retail banking operations in France on 1 January 2024 was an important milestone in the turnaround of our business. However, the strategic focus has shifted to investing for growth. The acquisition of SVB UK, and subsequent launch of HSBC Innovation Banking, is a good example of this.\n\nWe continued to capitalise on our strengths, which are our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, as well as our international wholesale, transaction banking and wealth businesses. The digitisation of our services for personal and corporate customers helped to improve our net promoter scores in key markets and businesses. Meanwhile the growth of transaction banking revenue, fee income in Commercial Banking, and net new invested assets in Wealth all underlined our focus on improving our earnings sustainability, which remains a key priority.\n\nOur colleagues are the driving force behind our performance and progress, with our 2023 employee Snapshot survey demonstrating that they are more engaged than ever. Our employee focus index, which gauges how colleagues feel about their day-to-day work, was 76%, which was an increase of four percentage points on 2022. Our employee engagement index is at an all time high of 77%, which was also an increase of three percentage points and meant we matched or exceeded the global financial services benchmark in all eight of our indices.\n\nWe also continued to support our customers in challenging economic times, particularly in the UK where we supported our personal and business customers by enhancing our range of digital resources and targeting those most in need.\n\n## Rewarding our colleagues\n\nOur goal is to deliver a unique and exceptional experience to colleagues so that we sustain our performance in competitive markets. Our reward principles and commitments centre on rewarding colleagues responsibly, recognising their success and supporting them to grow.\n\nPay is a critical part of our proposition. We were encouraged by a nine percentage point improvement to 52% in colleagues' perceptions they are paid fairly because of actions we took through 2022. The Committee remains very focused on the need to improve this further. For 2024, we are putting more structure in place to improve transparency and clarity about how we make pay decisions.\n\nBeyond pay we have a strong proposition of benefits, well-being support, flexible working options, and learning and career opportunities to support our colleagues.\n\nIn 2023, we saw the maturity of the 2020 three-year Sharesave plan, which had the highest take-up rate and contribution level in recent years. The share price at maturity was more than double the option price, meaning colleagues benefited from our share price growth at a time when they needed it most. Over 90% of colleagues have access to share ownership plans globally with 25% of our global population taking part.\n\nFor further details, see 'Our approach to workforce reward' on page 289.\n\n## Fixed pay\n\nFor the majority of our colleagues, fixed pay is the biggest part of their reward, and many continue to be impacted by the economic environment including inflation and cost of living challenges. Our focus is on ensuring that we provide financial security through fixed pay.\n\nFixed pay is primarily reviewed through our annual pay cycle. Fixed pay ranges were introduced for over 190,000 colleagues to improve clarity and transparency and simplify decision making for our people managers. Effective in 2024, we have awarded an overall fixed pay increase of 4.4%. The level of increases vary by market, depending on the economic situation and individual roles. The highest increases were made to lower paid colleagues, and then focused on middle management, so that we keep pace with wage inflation.\n\nWe have also established Living Wage benchmarks for every market and were certified as a global Living Wage employer by the Fair Wage Network for 2024. This is critical to give us further confidence in meeting our commitments to reward colleagues responsibly.\n\nWe continued to take tangible actions to address the most significant inflationary pressures for colleagues. For example, in Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye, we adjusted fixed pay regularly through the year. In Egypt, we supported our colleagues with a one-off pay adjustment in response to high inflation.\n\n## Variable pay\n\nIn determining the 2023 variable pay pool, the Committee wanted to recognise our strong financial and strategic performance, and the contribution colleagues have made to that.\n\nThe Committee determined an overall variable pay pool of $3,774m, 12% higher than $3,359m in 2022. This was determined based on a review of our performance against financial and non-financial metrics set out in the Group risk framework. The Committee considered the strength of our financial performance in 2023, and the ratio between variable pay and pre-variable pay profit before tax. The Committee considered the impact of margins on interest rates in our results, and lowered the total pool in line with our countercyclical funding approach. We also considered our total compensation position compared with the market, and the broader economic outlook.\n\nThe Committee considered in respect of all its remuneration decisions for 2023 the Prudential Regulation Authority's ('PRA') 29 January 2024 Notice relating to HSBC Bank plc's and HSBC UK's compliance with the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme ('FSCS') and related Depositor Protection rules. The PRA penalty was reflected in the calculation of profitability used to determine the pool. The Committee carefully considered input from the Group Risk Committee ('GRC') and determined that no further discretionary adjustment should be made to the overall variable pay pool. The circumstances leading to the penalty require a more detailed review internally to address potential responsibility of individuals, which will be completed by the Committee in 2024, with any remuneration adjustments applied once it is complete.\n\nTotal compensation across all our businesses increased relative to 2022, rewarding our colleagues for their contribution to our performance. The distribution of the pool by business considered relative performance against revenue, reported profit before tax and cost targets. Strong differentiation has meant our highest performers received the largest increases in variable pay compared with the previous year.\n\n## Key remuneration decisions for executive Directors\n\n## Annual incentive for 2023 performance\n\nThe Group's financial and strategic performance is reflected in the executive Directors' annual scorecards. The Committee believes this reflects their individual leadership and contribution to delivery of the Group's performance.\n\nAt the start of the year, the Committee set the scorecards to align with our reported financial performance. The Committee considered carefully the impact of strategic transactions and one-offs on the Group's financial performance in 2023, including the favourable yearon-year impact of $4.1bn relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and the provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK, balanced with the $3.0bn impairment charge relating to the investment in BoCom.\n\nConsistent with the approach in prior years, the Committee judged that it was appropriate to assess financial performance for the purpose of the annual scorecard excluding these items, to ensure that out-turns were not impacted by one-offs. The assessment of RoTE and profit before tax measures therefore excluded strategic transactions and the BoCom impairment.\n\nThe Committee also considered the impact of interest rates on performance and noted that macroeconomic fluctuations remain a frequent driver of the Group's business outcomes for our executives to manage. In recent years these factors have not led to discretionary scorecard adjustments for our executive Directors, either positive or negative, which the Committee continues to believe is appropriate.",

        "page_content": "As part of its deliberations, the Committee reflected on the overall risk management in the year, and in respect of the PRA Notice: the nature of the failings identified; the regulator's finding that the breaches identified were not deliberate or reckless; fines levied; and the tenure and specific responsibilities of the executive Directors in relation to the issues covered.\n\nTaking into account inputs from the GRC and the overall accountability of the Group Chief Executive for the performance and risk management of the Group in 2023, the Committee used its judgement and applied a downward adjustment of 7.50% to Noel Quinn's scorecard outcome.\n\nThis results in a final scorecard outcome of 70.24% of the maximum opportunity for Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn (2022: 75.35%) and an annual incentive of \u00a32,018,000, which is 7% lower than \u00a32,164,000 in 2022.\n\nThe scorecard for Group Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery was 76.75%, resulting in an annual incentive of \u00a31,287,000.\n\nThe Committee considered that these final outcomes were a balanced and appropriate reflection of Group and individual performance delivered in 2023, and appropriate in the context of the pay decisions made for the wider workforce.\n\n## 2021-2023 long-term incentive ('LTI') vesting\n\nNoel Quinn and Ewen Stevenson (the former Group Chief Financial Officer) participated in the 2021-2023 LTI that will vest in March 2024. As disclosed in our 2020 Directors' remuneration report, the Committee considered windfall gains at the time of award and determined no adjustment was appropriate.\n\nThe maximum RoTE and relative total shareholder return ('TSR') targets were exceeded. The capital reallocation to Asia measure was not met and the environment and sustainability measures were assessed to be 100% met. Overall, 75.00% of the original award will vest on a pro-rata basis over the next five years. Ewen Stevenson's awards have been pro-rated for time in employment.\n\nAs this is the first LTI vesting for Noel Quinn, his single figure of remuneration for 2023 is materially changed. The 2023 single figure of remuneration for Noel Quinn is \u00a310,641,000 (compared with \u00a35,562,000 for 2022). The value of the LTI award reflects the Group's improvement in performance, shareholder returns and share price over 2021 to 2023, and Noel Quinn's leadership in reshaping the Group to deliver more sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\nNoel Quinn's LTI vesting also means that the pay ratio measuring the total pay of the Group Chief Executive against the median pay of our UK employees has increased to 169:1 compared with 95:1 last year. Excluding the LTI vesting in respect of the year, the median ratio remained broadly in line with prior years at 86:1. This is consistent with the pay and progression policies for our UK workforce, considering the diverse mix of employees, the pay mix for various roles and the differences in pay structure compared with executive Directors.\n\n## 2024-2026 LTI awards\n\nWe have reviewed the performance measures for LTI awards considering the next phase of our strategy over 2024 to 2026. We will retain Group RoTE, relative TSR and environment targets, reflecting our strategic commitments, and to measure relative performance compared with peers. The capital reallocation to Asia measure was previously included to retain focus on repositioning the Group's capital base through the transformation of the business. While our operations in Asia continue to be of significant strategic importance to the Group, it was the Committee's view that this measure no longer appropriately incentivises the delivery of sustainable returns achievable across wider markets in which HSBC operates. We are simplifying the 2024-2026 LTI by removing this metric and increasing the weighting of RoTE and relative TSR.\n\nThe relative TSR peer group was amended for 2023 to include more Asian peers to better reflect our growth and investment focus. We do not propose to make any changes for 2024 other than the removal of the Credit Suisse Group following its acquisition by UBS Group.\n\nNoel Quinn and Georges Elhedery will each receive a 2024-2026 LTI award of 320% of base salary in respect of their performance for 2023 (Noel Quinn: \u00a34,275,000; Georges Elhedery: \u00a32,496,000). Subject to performance over the next three years, awards will vest over a further five years with a one-year retention period on vesting shares. Further details on our targets can be found on page 286.\n\n## Fixed pay for 2024\n\nWe have increased the base salary of our executive Directors by 3%, effective from 1 March 2024. The increase is lower than the overall fixed pay increase of 4.4% for our wider workforce.\n\n## Remuneration in 2024\n\nThe Committee welcomes the change announced by the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') to remove the existing limits on the ratio between fixed and variable pay.\n\nThe announcement, together with the wider considerations on the overall competitiveness of the UK capital markets, provides us an opportunity to consider the competitiveness of our remuneration arrangements for our executive Directors and wider workforce.\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, we will seek shareholder approval to provide the Committee with discretion, where regulations allow, to set an appropriate variable to fixed pay ratio considering all relevant factors, including our business activities and associated prudential and conduct risks.\n\nThis will improve flexibility in the structure of remuneration to increase the amount of pay that is variable, subject to the delivery of performance. It will also strengthen our ability to recruit and retain people in competitive markets where many of our international competitors do not have similar restrictions.\n\nWe remain very supportive of the use of deferral mechanisms and the requirements to deliver a substantial portion of variable remuneration in shares to ensure alignment between shareholders, good risk management and individual reward.\n\nFor our executive Directors, we have started early engagement with institutional shareholders and proxy advisory bodies ahead of the renewal of our Directors' remuneration policy in 2025. Over several years, the Committee has expressed concerns around the competitiveness of the executive Director remuneration opportunity and indicated that our preference would be to operate a policy with a higher proportion of the package based on variable pay linked to performance. The Committee continues to believe in a more performance-based structure, and we will seek shareholder approval for a new Directors' remuneration policy at the 2025 AGM in line with the normal three-year cycle after engaging with shareholders through 2024.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank our shareholders for the time taken to engage with us during the year. We welcome the feedback on our approach to remuneration and I look forward to engaging with you further in the year ahead as we continue our review of the Directors' remuneration policy, in advance of the 2025 AGM.\n\nAs Chair of the Committee, I hope you will support the 2023 Directors' remuneration report and the resolution to remove the 2:1 cap on variable pay for our Material Risk Takers at this year's AGM.\n\n## Dame Carolyn Fairbairn\n\n## Chair\n\nGroup Remuneration Committee\n\n21 February 2024",

Both executive Directors met this requirement for 2023.\n\nThe award is determined by applying the outcome of their annual scorecard to the maximum opportunity, set at 215% of base salary.\n\nThe financial measures, weightings and targets were set at the start of the financial year to align with our reported financial performance and before significant changes in the interest rate environment. They considered the 2023 financial plan, data from 2022, external commitments, scenario testing of upside and downside risks in the plan, and analyst consensus where relevant.\n\nThe Committee considered carefully the wider context in which performance was delivered and the impact of strategic transactions and one-offs on the Group's financial performance in 2023, including the favourable year-on-year impact of $4.1bn relating to the sale of our retail banking operations in France and the provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK, balanced with the $3.0bn impairment charge relating to the investment in BoCom.\n\nConsistent with the approach in prior years, the Committee judged that it was appropriate to assess financial performance for the purpose of the annual scorecard excluding these items, to ensure that out-turns were not impacted by one-offs. The assessment of RoTE and profit before tax measures therefore excluded strategic transactions and the BoCom impairment.\n\nThe Committee also considered the impact of interest rates on performance and noted that macroeconomic fluctuations remain a frequent driver of the Group's business outcomes for our executives to manage. In recent years these factors have not led to discretionary scorecard adjustments for our executive Directors, either positive or negative, which the Committee continues to believe is appropriate.\n\nPerformance was above the maximum targets for Group profit before tax, Group RoTE and Asia RoTE.

Our customer net promoter score ('NPS') performance was largely positive relative to our competitors in most areas of our business.\n\nThe Committee considered that the scorecard outcome for personal measures for both Noel Quinn and Georges Elhedery was appropriate against the targets set at the start of the year.\n\nOverall, this resulted in a formulaic scorecard outcome of 75.93% of the maximum for Noel Quinn and 76.75% for Georges Elhedery.\n\nThe Committee discussed at length whether the risk and compliance modifier should be applied for 2023 for the Group's performance against key risk metrics, including the historical failings identified by the PRA in its Notice of 29 January 2024.\n\nAs part of its deliberations, the Committee reflected on the overall risk management in the year, and in respect of the PRA Notice: the nature of the failings identified; the regulator's finding that the breaches identified were not deliberate or reckless; fines levied; and the tenure and specific responsibilities of the executive Directors in relation to the issues covered.\n\nTaking into account inputs from the Group Risk Committee and Noel Quinn's overall accountability for the performance and risk management of the Group in 2023, the Committee used its judgement and applied a downward adjustment of 7.50% to his scorecard outcome.\n\nThis results in a final outcome of 70.24% of the maximum opportunity for Noel Quinn (2022: 75.35%) and an annual incentive of \u00a32,018,000, which is 7% lower than \u00a32,164,000 in 2022.\n\nNo risk and compliance modifier was applied for Georges Elhedery who was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 January 2023, after all underlying issues identified by the PRA had been fully remediated. Georges Elhedery's scorecard outcome of 76.75% results in an annual incentive of \u00a31,287,000.",

The shares portion of the award vests immediately at grant and is subject to a retention period of one year and clawback provisions.\n- 4 Deferred cash awards granted in prior years include a right to receive notional returns for the period between the grant and vesting date. This is determined by reference to a rate of return specified at the time of grant and paid annually, with the amount disclosed on a paid basis.\n- 5 An LTI award over 1,118,554 shares was made in February 2021 (in respect of 2020) at a share price of \u00a34.262 for which the performance period ended on 31 December 2023. The value has been computed based on a share price of \u00a36.192, the average share price during the three-month period to 31 December 2023. The value attributable to share price appreciation is \u00a31,619,106. See the following section for details of the assessment outcomes, which resulted in 75.00% vesting due to performance.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe values of the significant benefits in the single figure table are set out in the following table. The insurance benefit for Noel Quinn has increased year on year because of the increase in premium at annual renewal.

Georges Elhedery was in a different role at the time and did not receive the 2021-2023 LTI award.\n\nThe scorecard delivered an outcome of 75.00%, reflecting a significant improvement in shareholder returns across the performance period.\n\nIn line with the terms of his departure, Ewen Stevenson is a good leaver and his award has been pro-rated for time in employment. Based on the performance outcome, 838,915 shares will vest for Noel Quinn and 371,697 shares will vest for Ewen Stevenson. The awards will vest in five equal annual instalments commencing in March 2024.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of executives not experiencing 'windfall gains' through the granting of LTI awards when a share price is\n\nparticularly low. We introduced an upfront windfall gains check for the 2021-2023 LTI award such that if the LTI grant share price experienced a greater than 30% decline since the previous grant, then a downward adjustment would be made. The Committee determined that there were no windfall gains to consider for this award given the share price at grant (\u00a34.26) was 24% below the share price at the previous LTI grant (\u00a35.62).\n\nThe 2021-2023 LTI award is subject to a risk and compliance modifier. The Committee received input from the GRC who assessed that the performance targets were delivered with appropriate risk management. On this basis, the Committee considered that no adjustment for risk should be made to the 2021-2023 LTI award. The CET1 capital ratio underpin for the 2021-2023 LTI award was also met.",

Morgan Chase & Co., Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and UBS Group. Credit Suisse Group was removed from the peer group following its acquisition by UBS Group in June 2023.\n\n## LTI awards over 2024 to 2026 performance period\n\nAfter taking into account performance for 2023, the Committee decided to grant Noel Quinn an LTI award of \u00a34,275,000 and Georges Elhedery an LTI award of \u00a32,496,000 (both 320% of base salary).\n\nThe awards will have a three-year performance period starting on 1 January 2024.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the performance measures considering feedback from shareholders and the next phase of our strategy. We are simplifying and improving the focus on shareholder returns by assessing performance on three measures, including RoTE and relative TSR which are equally-weighted financial measures, and a third measure linked to our climate ambitions.\n\nThe capital reallocation to Asia measure was previously included to retain focus on repositioning the Group's capital base through the transformation of the business. While our operations in Asia continue to be of significant strategic importance to the Group, it was the Committee's view that this measure no longer appropriately incentivised the delivery of sustainable returns achievable across wider markets in which HSBC operates.\n\nTargets have been set to balance stretch and achievability so that awards act as an effective incentive for management, and incentivise outperformance, aligned to our external strategic commitments.\n\n- -The minimum threshold for the RoTE measure is aligned to our external commitment of mid-teens RoTE over the medium term.\n- -The relative TSR peer group was amended for 2023 to include more Asian peers to better reflect our growth and investment focus. No changes have been made for 2024 other than the removal of the Credit Suisse Group following its acquisition by UBS Group.\n- -Our emissions reduction targets have been set based on meeting our commitments to procure 90% renewable energy by 2025 and halve energy consumption and travel emissions by 2030.\n- -Our sustainable finance and investments measure is based on our ambition announced in 2020 to provide $750bn to $1tn of financing and investment by 2030. Although the target range is lower than for the 2023-2025 LTI awards, we are on track to meet our 2030 ambition, with changing market conditions slightly impacting our year-on-year trajectory.\n\nThe LTI is subject to a risk and compliance modifier, which gives the Committee the discretion to ensure performance targets are delivered with appropriate risk management.\n\nThe RoTE measure is subject to a CET1 capital ratio underpin. If the CET1 capital ratio at the end of the performance period is below the CET1 risk tolerance level set in the risk appetite statement, then the assessment for this measure will be reduced to nil.\n\nThe number of shares to be awarded will be adjusted to reflect the expected dividend yield of the shares over the vesting period, as awards are not entitled to dividend equivalents in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nTo the extent performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period, the awards will vest in five equal annual instalments commencing from around the third anniversary of the grant date. On vesting, shares equivalent to the net number of shares that have vested (after those sold to cover any income tax and social security payable) will be held for a retention period of up to one year, or such period as required by regulators.",

The weighting of Group RoTE has increased to 25% (from 15% in 2023). The overall weighting of financial measures remains at 60%.\n\nFinancial measures will be assessed on a reported basis excluding notable items so that the outcome reflects performance excluding the impact of one-off and items not controlled by management.\n\nOur first net zero transition plan was launched in January 2024 setting out our approach to net zero and the actions we are taking. To support our ambition, a sustainability measure has been added to the annual scorecard, which will be assessed based on the execution of our sustainability commitments against Board approved plans.\n\nPersonal measures have been set to ensure meaningful weighting for the most critical objectives for each executive Director.\n\nThe Committee will continue to retain discretion to adjust the formulaic outcomes of scorecards, taking into account factors such as Group profits, wider business performance and stakeholder experience, to ensure executive reward is aligned with underlying Group performance and the broader stakeholder experience.\n\nThe weightings and performance measures for the 2024 annual incentive scorecard for executive Directors are in the adjacent table.\n\nThe targets have been set to reflect the Group's 2024 plan, while considering macroeconomic uncertainty, including the interest rate environment and inflation. The performance targets are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Group's interests to disclose them at the start of the financial year. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we will disclose the targets in the 2024 Directors' remuneration report.\n\n| 2024 annual incentive performance measures                                                                                                                                                     | Weighting   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial (all measures subject to CET1 capital ratio  underpin, and excluding notable items)                                                                                                  | 60.0%       |\n| Profit before tax                                                                                                                                                                              | 15.0%       |\n| Operating expenses                                                                                                                                                                             | 15.0%       |\n| Group RoTE                                                                                                                                                                                     | 25.0%       |\n| Asia RoTE                                                                                                                                                                                      | 5.0%        |\n| Stakeholders                                                                                                                                                                                   | 30.0%       |\n| Customer satisfaction                                                                                                                                                                          | 15.0%       |\n| Improvement in NPS scores/rank                                                                                                                                                                 |             |\n| Employee experience  Gender and ethnicity representation and Inclusion index score                                                                                                             | 10.0%       |\n| Execution of our sustainability commitments against Board  approved plans                                                                                                                      | 5.0%        |\n| Personal measures                                                                                                                                                                              |             |\n| - Group Chief Executive: Technology transformation and  enhanced Board information                                                                                                             | 10.0%       |\n| - Group Chief Financial Officer: Delivery of regulatory change  programmes (including regulatory reporting), enhancement of  external disclosures and robust liquidity and capital  management |             |\n| Subject to risk and compliance modifier                                                                                                                                                        |             |",

This is critical to strengthening our ability to attract, retain and motivate the people we need, in competitive markets where employee expectations continue to evolve.\n\nOur approach is centred on our purpose and values, and our reward principles and commitments are:\n\n- -We will reward our colleagues responsibly through fixed pay security and protection through core benefits, a competitive total compensation opportunity, pay equity, and a more inclusive and sustainable benefits proposition over time.\n- -We will recognise colleagues' success through our performance culture and routines, including feedback and recognition, pay for performance, and all employee share ownership opportunities.\n- -We will support our colleagues to grow through our proposition beyond pay, with a focus on future skills and development, support for well-being, and flexibility.\n\nPay is an important part of our overall proposition. Our focus is improving transparency and clarity for colleagues so they understand better how we make pay decisions.\n\nFor 2024, we will introduce a new variable pay structure for over 150,000 junior and middle management colleagues, providing more clarity around the variable pay levels for on-target performance, while retaining flexibility to differentiate outcomes for performance.\n\nWe have been certified by the Fair Wage Network as a global Living Wage employer for 2024. This is an important commitment to give colleagues confidence that our fixed pay levels are sufficient to provide financial security.\n\nThe section below highlights some of our achievements in 2023.\n\n## We will reward you responsibly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n78%\n\n\u25b2\n\nup 5% from 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues say pay recommendations determined regardless of personal characteristics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n52%\n\n\u25b2\n\nup 9% from 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues say they are paid fairly for what they do\n\nsame as 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues say my benefits meet my (and my family's) needs well\n\n## We will recognise your success\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 81%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nup 7% from 2022\n\nof colleagues say they receive feedback helping them improve performance\n\n## 1.4 million recognitions\n\nthe highest since the At Our Best recognition platform was launched in 2015\n\n## We will support you to grow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nup 20% from 2022\n\nof colleagues work flexibly and split their time between home and the workplace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n71%\n\n\u25b2\n\nup 3% from 2022\n\nour career index is higher than the financial services benchmark by 6%\n\nMany of our colleagues found 2023 to be a challenging year. While inflation has fallen from levels seen in 2022, it remains high across many of our markets, which has resulted in continued pressures on the cost of living.\n\nFixed pay increases for 2024 were determined based on consistent principles to help address wage inflation in the markets where we operate. Across the Group, there was an overall increase in fixed pay of 4.4%. The level of increases varied by market, depending on the economic situation and individual roles. Increases were targeted towards more junior and middle management colleagues where fixed pay is a larger proportion of overall pay.\n\nWe continued to take action outside of our annual cycle to address inflation pressures for colleagues, where the local context required this. In Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye, we gave our colleagues fixed pay increases throughout the year. In Egypt, we supported our colleagues with a one-off pay adjustment in response to high inflation.\n\nOver 90% of colleagues have access to share ownership plans globally, with 25% of our global employee population taking part. In the UK, following the maturity of the three-year 2020 Sharesave plan with an option price of \u00a32.627, colleagues benefited from significant share price growth at a time when they needed it most. The 2020 plan had the highest take up rate and contribution level in recent years.\n\nOur approach to benefits and well-being balances local market practice with global minimum standards. More than 95% of colleagues have private medical insurance, a retirement plan and life insurance.\n\nOur well-being programme focuses on mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing. In our employee Snapshot survey, 83% of colleagues said their mental health was positive. HSBC has been ranked top tier for mental health in the global CCLA Corporate Mental Health Benchmark.\n\nWe have prioritised supporting colleagues to work flexibly, balancing customer needs, social connection and individual flexibility. Flexible working remains one of the most cited reasons why colleagues would recommend HSBC as a place to work, and a third of new joiners say it is what attracted them to HSBC.\n\nWe have delivered a world-class talent marketplace and learning experience platform, providing learning pathways, projects and networking opportunities to more than 200,000 colleagues. An average of 23.9 hours of training was delivered per FTE in 2023.",

The increase in median ratio is primarily driven by the vesting of the 2021-2023 long-term incentive ('LTI'), which is the first he has received as Group Chief Executive. Excluding the LTI vesting in respect of the year, the ratio remained broadly in line with prior years at 86:1 at median.\n\nTotal pay ratio\n\n|      | Method   | Lower  quartile   | Median   | Upper  quartile   |\n|------|----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| 2023 | A        | 291:1             | 169:1    | 88:1              |\n| 2022 | A        | 167:1             | 95:1     | 49:1              |\n| 2021 | A        | 154:1             | 90:1     | 46:1              |\n| 2020 | A        | 139:1             | 85:1     | 43:1              |\n| 2019 | A        | 169:1             | 105:1    | 52:1              |\n\nTotal pay and benefits amounts used to calculate the ratio\n\n|      |        | Lower quartile           | Lower quartile   | Median                   | Median        | Upper quartile           | Upper quartile   |\n|------|--------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| (\u00a3)  | Method | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary    | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary    |\n| 2023 | A      | 36,528                   | 27,680           | 63,000                   | 45,536        | 121,223                  | 89,506           |\n| 2022 | A      | 33,284                   | 24,615           | 58,257                   | 41,000        | 113,778                  | 95,000           |\n| 2021 | A      | 31,727                   | 27,666           | 54,678                   | 41,500        | 106,951                  | 84,000           |\n| 2020 | A      | 29,833                   | 23,264           | 48,703                   | 36,972        | 96,386                   | 75,000           |\n| 2019 | A      | 28,920                   | 24,235           | 46,593                   | 41,905        | 93,365                   | 72,840           |\n\nThe total pay and benefits for the median employee for 2023 was \u00a363,000, an 8.1% increase compared with 2022.\n\nOur UK workforce comprises a diverse mix of colleagues across different businesses and levels of seniority, from junior cashiers in our retail branches to senior executives managing our global business units. We aim to deliver market-competitive pay for each role, taking into consideration the skills and experience required for the business.\n\nPay structure varies across roles in order to deliver an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay. Junior colleagues have a greater portion of their pay delivered in a fixed component, which does not vary with performance and allows them to predictably meet their day-to-day needs. Our senior management, including executive Directors, generally have a higher portion of their total remuneration opportunity structured as variable pay and linked to the performance of the Group, given their role and ability to influence the strategy and performance of the Group. Executive Directors also have a higher proportion of their variable pay delivered in shares, which vest over a period of seven years with a post-vesting retention period of one year. During this deferral and retention period, the awards are linked to the share price so the value of award realised by them after the vesting and retention period will be aligned to the performance of the Group.\n\nWe are satisfied that the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay and progression policies for our UK workforce, taking into account the diverse mix of our UK employees, the pay mix applicable to each role and our objective of delivering market competitive pay for each role subject to Group, business and individual performance.\n\nOur ratios have been calculated using the option 'A' methodology prescribed under the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018. Under this option, the ratios are calculated using full-time equivalent pay and benefits of all employees providing services in the UK at 31 December 2023. We believe this approach provides accurate information and representation of the ratios. The\n\nratio has been computed taking into account the pay and benefits of nearly 33,000 UK employees, other than the Group Chief Executive. We calculated our pay quartiles and benefits information for our UK employees using:\n\n- -full-time equivalent annualised fixed pay, which includes base salary and allowances, at 31 December 2023;\n- -variable pay awards for 2023;\n- -return on deferred cash awards granted in prior years. The deferred cash portion of the annual incentive granted in prior years includes a right to receive notional returns for the period between the grant date and vesting date, which is determined by reference to a rate of return specified at the time of grant. A payment of notional return is made annually and the amount is disclosed on a paid basis in the year in which the payment is made;\n- -gains realised from exercising awards from taxable employee share plans; and\n- -full-time equivalent value of taxable benefits and pension contributions.\n\nFull-time equivalent fixed pay and benefits for each employee have been calculated by using each employee's data as at 31 December 2023. Where an employee works part-time, fixed pay and benefits are grossed up, where appropriate, to full-time equivalent. One-off benefits have not been included in calculating the ratios as these are not permanent in nature and in some cases, depending on individual circumstances, may not truly reflect a benefit to the employee.\n\nThe reported ratios may not be comparable to our international and listed peers on the FTSE 100, given differences in business mix and size; employment and compensation practices; methodologies for computing pay ratios; and assumptions used by companies.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe following chart shows the change in:\n\n- -total employee pay between 2022 and 2023; and\n- -dividends and share buy-backs in respect of 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn 2023, total spend on pay was slightly higher than in 2022. The total return to shareholders increased by 156% compared with 2022, reflecting a higher dividend and $7bn of capital return to shareholders through share buy-backs, which included the up to $3bn buy-back announced at our third quarter of 2023 results. In addition, the Group has announced the intention to initiate a further up to $2bn buy-back. Dividends include an approximation of the amount payable in April 2024 in relation to the fourth interim dividend of $0.31 per ordinary share.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1    In our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 , we disclosed that the total return to shareholders was $9,144m, of which $8,144m related to dividends in 2022. This was an error and has been corrected in the chart above.",

On vesting, awards will be subject to a one-year retention period. The face value of the immediate share awards have been computed using HSBC's closing share price of \u00a36.357 taken on 24 February 2023. Awards are subject to clawback for a maximum period of 10 years from the date of the award.\n- 3 Fixed pay allowance awards are granted in instalments in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, and are not subject to forward-looking performance conditions. Individual tax liabilities were satisfied in cash, therefore the face value awarded represents the net of tax value of the shares and the number of shares awarded reflects the net of tax number of shares. The fixed pay allowance awards have been computed using HSBC's closing share price of \u00a35.997 taken on 12 May 2023, \u00a35.839 taken on 18 August 2023 and \u00a36.093 taken on 6 November 2023. These awards vest immediately and are subject to a retention period and released annually on pro-rata basis over five years, starting in March 2024.\n\n## Performance conditions for the 2023-2025 LTI awards\n\n(Audited)\n\n| Measures (weighting) 1                                                     |                                                                            | Minimum (25% payout)        | Target (50% payout)                                 | Maximum (100% payout)            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| RoTE (with CET1 capital ratio underpin) 2  (25.0%)                         | RoTE (with CET1 capital ratio underpin) 2  (25.0%)                         | 13.0%                       | 14.3%                                               | 15.5%                            |\n| Capital reallocation to Asia (with CET1 capital ratio underpin) 3  (25.0%) | Capital reallocation to Asia (with CET1 capital ratio underpin) 3  (25.0%) | 49.0%                       | 50.5%                                               | 52.0%                            |\n|                                                                            | Carbon reduction                                                           | 64.0%                       | 68.0%                                               | 72.0%                            |\n| Environment and  sustainability 4  (25.0%)                                 | Sustainable finance and  investment                                        | $588.0bn                    | $700.0bn                                            | $756.0bn                         |\n| Relative TSR 5  (25.0%)                                                    |                                                                            | At median of the peer group | Straight-line vesting  between minimum and  maximum | At upper quartile of  peer group |\n\n- 2 To be assessed based on RoTE at the end of the performance period.\n- 3 To be assessed based on share of Group tangible equity (on a constant currency basis and excluding associates) allocated to Asia by 31 December 2025.\n- 4 Carbon reduction will be measured based on percentage reduction in total energy and travel emissions achieved by 31 December 2025 using 2019 as the baseline.

The following table shows the comparison of shareholdings with the company shareholding guidelines. There have been no changes in the shareholdings of the executive Directors from 31 December 2023 to the date of this report.\n\nIndividuals have five years from their appointment date to build up the recommended levels of shareholding. In line with investor guidance, for executive Directors, unvested shares that are not subject to forward-looking performance conditions (on a net of tax basis) can count towards their shareholding requirement under the shareholderapproved policy.\n\nThe Committee reviews compliance with the shareholding requirement, taking into account shareholder expectations and guidelines.

The notice periods of executive Directors are set at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account market practice, governance considerations, and the skills and experience of the particular candidate at that time.\n\nService agreements for each executive Director are available for inspection at HSBC Holdings' registered office. Consistent with the best interests of the Group, the Committee will seek to minimise termination payments. Directors may be eligible for a payment in relation to statutory rights.\n\n|                  | Contract date (rolling)   | Notice period (Director and HSBC)   |\n|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Noel Quinn       | 18 March 2020             | 12 months                           |\n| Georges Elhedery | 1 January 2023            | 12 months                           |\n\n## Total pension entitlements\n\n## (Audited)\n\nNo employees who served as executive Directors during the year have a right to amounts under any HSBC final salary pension scheme for their services as executive Directors or are entitled to additional benefits in the event of early retirement. There is no retirement age set for Directors, but the normal retirement age for colleagues is 65.\n\n## Payments to past Directors\n\n## (Audited)\n\nHSBC has received a formal request from the former employer of Ewen Stevenson to reduce the buy-out award granted to him in 2019 by \u00a382,980, which will be offset against the next available vesting for this award. The reduction will be made in line with PRA regulations, acting on the decision made by Ewen Stevenson's former employer. We understand the reduction was part of a collective adjustment and there are no concerns over Ewen Stevenson's conduct or the discharge of his individual accountabilities.\n\nPayments Ewen Stevenson received after he stepped down as an executive Director are set out in the following section.\n\nIn line with the terms of his departure disclosed in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 , Ewen Stevenson was granted good leaver status and is therefore eligible to receive vesting of the 2021-2023 LTI award, which was pro-rated for time in employment. Ewen's good leaver status is conditional upon satisfaction of non-compete provisions under which he cannot undertake a role with a defined list of competitor financial services firms for 12 months after his employment ceases with HSBC. Details of the 2021-2023 LTI outcome are outlined on page 286.\n\nNo other payments were made to, or in respect of, former Directors in the year in excess of the minimum threshold of \u00a350,000 set for this purpose.\n\nWith regard to post-employment shareholding arrangements, we believe that our remuneration structure achieves the objective of ensuring there is ongoing alignment of executive Directors' interests with shareholder experience post-cessation of their employment due to the following features of the policy:\n\n- -Shares delivered to executive Directors as part of the fixed pay allowance have a five-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- -Shares delivered as part of an annual incentive award are subject to a one-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- -LTI awards have a seven-year vesting period with a one-year postvesting retention period, which is not accelerated on departure.\n\nThe weighted average holding period of an LTI award within HSBC is therefore six years, in excess of the five-year holding period typically implemented by FTSE-listed companies.\n\nHSBC operates a policy under which individuals are not permitted to enter into any personal hedging strategies in relation to HSBC shares subject to a vesting and/or retention period.",

For further details of the dividends approved in 2023, see Note 8 on the financial statements.\n\nOn 21 February 2024, the Directors approved a fourth interim dividend for 2023 of $0.31 per ordinary share, making a total of $0.61 for the 2023 full-year.

As the fourth interim dividend for 2023 was approved after 31 December 2023, it has not been included in the balance sheet of HSBC as a liability. The distributable reserves of HSBC Holdings at 31 December 2023 were $30.9bn.\n\nA quarterly dividend of \u00a30.01 per Series A sterling preference share was paid on 15 March, 15 June, 15 September and 15 December 2023.\n\n## Dividends for 2024\n\nThe Group intends to pay quarterly dividends on its ordinary shares during 2024.\n\nA quarterly dividend of \u00a30.01 per Series A sterling preference share is payable on 15 March, 17 June, 16 September and 16 December 2024 for the quarter then ended at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board of HSBC Holdings plc. Accordingly, the Board of HSBC Holdings plc has approved a quarterly dividend to be payable on 15 March 2024 to holders of record on 29 February 2024.\n\n## Share capital\n\n## Issued share capital\n\nThe nominal value of HSBC Holdings' issued share capital paid up at 31 December 2023 was $9,631,364,096.50 divided into 19,262,728,193 ordinary shares of $0.50 each and one noncumulative preference share of \u00a30.01, representing approximately 100.00% and 0.00% respectively of the nominal value of HSBC Holdings' total issued share capital paid up at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Rights, obligations and restrictions attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations attaching to each class of ordinary and noncumulative preference shares in our share capital are set out in full in our Articles of Association. The Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders and can be found on our website at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-andgovernance/board-responsibilities.\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nHSBC Holdings has one class of ordinary share, which carries no right to fixed income. There are no voting restrictions on the issued ordinary shares, all of which are fully paid. On a show of hands, each member present has the right to one vote at general meetings. On a poll, each member present or voting by proxy is entitled to one vote for every $0.50 nominal value of share capital held.\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on transfers of ordinary shares, which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\nInformation on the policy adopted by the Board for paying interim dividends on the ordinary shares may be found in the 'Shareholder information' section on page 435.\n\n## Dividend waivers\n\nThe Group's employee benefit trusts, which hold shares in HSBC Holdings in connection with the operation of its share plans, have lodged standing instructions to waive dividends on shares held by them that have not been allocated to employees. Shares held by custodians in connection with the vesting of employee share awards also lodged instructions to waive dividends. The total amount of dividends waived during 2023 was $27.16m.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe preference shares, which have preferential rights to income and capital, do not, in general, confer a right to attend and vote at general meetings.\n\nThere are three classes of preference shares in the share capital of HSBC Holdings: non-cumulative US dollar preference shares of $0.01 each ('dollar preference shares'); non-cumulative preference shares of \u00a30.01 each ('sterling preference shares'); and non-cumulative preference shares of \u20ac0.01 ('euro preference shares').\n\nThe sterling preference share in issue is a Series A sterling preference share. There are no dollar preference shares or euro preference shares in issue.\n\nInformation on dividends approved for 2022 and 2023 may be found in Note 8 on the financial statements on page 371.\n\nFurther details of the rights and obligations attaching to the HSBC Holdings' issued share capital may be found in Note 33 on the financial statements.\n\n## Compliance with Hong Kong Listing Rule 13.25A(2)\n\nHSBC Holdings has been granted a waiver from strict compliance with Rule 13.25A(2) of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\nUnder this waiver, HSBC's obligation to file a Next Day Return following the issue of new shares, pursuant to the vesting of share awards granted under its share plans to persons who are not Directors, would only be triggered where it falls within one of the circumstances set out under Rule 13.25A(3).\n\n## Share capital changes in 2023\n\nIn addition to the share buy-back programme, the following events occurred during the year in relation to the ordinary share capital of HSBC Holdings:\n\n## Scrip dividends\n\nThere were no scrip dividends issued during the year.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nOn 30 October 2023, HSBC Holdings cancelled 325,273,407 ordinary shares which were held in treasury, and no longer holds any ordinary shares in treasury.",

The Board has the power to authorise conflicts where they arise, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and HSBC Holdings' Articles of Association. Details of all Directors' conflicts of interest are recorded in the register of conflicts. Upon appointment, new Directors are advised of the policy and procedures for managing conflicts. Directors are required to notify the Board of any actual or potential conflicts of interest and to update the Board with any changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding such conflicts. Directors are requested to review and confirm their own and their respective closely associated persons' outside interests and appointments twice each year. The Board has considered, and authorised (with or without conditions) where appropriate, potential conflicts as they have arisen during the year in accordance with its conflicts policy and procedures. All non-executive Directors are subject to re-vetting by the Group's compliance team on a triennial basis following appointment. As part of this re-vetting process, all conflicts checks are refreshed.\n\n## Joint Company Secretary\n\nAileen Taylor is the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer.\n\nHannah Ashdown (47) was appointed as Deputy Group Secretary in December 2021 and for administrative purposes, in October 2022, was appointed as Joint Company Secretary.

        "page_content": "## Directors' indemnity\n\nThe Articles of Association of HSBC Holdings contain a qualifying third-party indemnity provision, which entitles Directors and other officers to be indemnified out of the assets of HSBC Holdings against claims from third parties in respect of certain liabilities.\n\nHSBC Holdings has granted, by way of deed poll, indemnities to the Directors, including former Directors, against certain liabilities arising in connection with their position as a Director of HSBC Holdings or of any Group company. Directors are indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe indemnities that constitute a 'qualifying third-party indemnity provision', as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006, remained in force for the whole of the financial year (or, in the case of Directors appointed during 2023, from the date of their appointment). The deed poll is available for inspection at the registered office of HSBC Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, Directors and pension trustees have the benefit of both Directors' and officers' liability insurance and pension trustees' liability insurance.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted to the trustees of the Group's pension schemes, which were in force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\n## Contracts of significance\n\nDuring 2023, none of the Directors had a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of significance with any HSBC company. During the year, all Directors were reminded of their obligations in respect of transacting in HSBC securities and following specific enquiry all Directors have confirmed that they have complied with their obligations.\n\n## Shareholder engagement and communication\n\nThe Board is directly accountable to, and gives high priority to communicating with, HSBC's shareholders. Information about HSBC and its activities is provided to shareholders in its Interim Reports and the Annual Report and Accounts as well as on www.hsbc.com.\n\nThe Board seeks to understand investor needs through ongoing dialogue between members of the Board and institutional investors throughout the year. For examples of such engagement, see 'Board engagement with shareholders' on page 256 and the Group Remuneration Committee Chair's letter on page 279. During 2023, approximately 643 meetings were held with institutional investors and analysts globally.\n\nOur shareholder communications policy summarises how we communicate with our shareholders, including through financial reporting, general shareholder meetings, investor and analyst meetings and our website. The policy is reviewed annually by the Board, and in 2023 the Board confirmed that it was satisfied with its implementation and effectiveness. The policy can be found at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-and-governance/boardresponsibilities.\n\nWe also publish our current and past financial results, investor presentations and shareholder information such as dividend payments and shareholder meeting details. Stock exchange announcements are also accessible on our website along with information for fixed income investors. For further details, see www.hsbc.com/investors.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to develop an understanding of the views of shareholders. Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholdings and HSBC's business are welcomed.\n\nAny individual or institutional investor can make an enquiry by contacting the investor relations team, Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. Our Senior Independent\n\nDirector is also available to shareholders if they have concerns that cannot be resolved or for which the normal channels would not be appropriate. They can be contacted via the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer at 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ.\n\nThe results of the poll vote at the 2023 AGM were published on 5 May 2023 and showed that on resolutions 2, 3(l), 6, 7, 14 and 15 we received votes of between 20.04% to 23.30% against the Board's recommendations. In our statement of 5 May 2023, it was noted that our largest shareholder, Ping An, voted against the Board's recommendations on the above resolutions and a number of others. Ping An's votes accounted for approximately 18% to 19% of all votes cast at the 2023 AGM based on a turnout of around 50%. The Board was pleased that a large majority of shareholders voting at the 2023 AGM supported HSBC's strategy and since the AGM there have been no concerns expressed by shareholders regarding the above resolutions. As referenced in the announcement released on 3 November 2023, we continue to have constructive dialogue and provide corporate access to all our institutional shareholders, including Ping An and respect and listen to their views.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe AGM in 2024 is planned to be held in London, UK at 11:00am on Friday, 3 May 2024. Information on how to vote and participate, both in advance and on the day, can be found in the Notice of the 2024 AGM, which will be sent to shareholders on 22 March 2024 and be available on www.hsbc.com/agm. A live webcast will be available on www.hsbc.com. A recording of the proceedings will be available on www.hsbc.com shortly after the conclusion of the AGM. Shareholders should monitor our website and announcements for any changes to these arrangements. Shareholders may send enquiries to the Board in writing via the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, HSBC Holdings plc, 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ or by sending an email to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com.\n\n## General meetings and resolutions\n\nShareholders may require the Directors to call a general meeting other than an AGM, as provided by the UK Companies Act 2006. A valid request to call a general meeting may be made by members representing at least 5% of the paid-up capital of HSBC Holdings as carries the right of voting at its general meetings (excluding any paidup capital held as treasury shares). A request must state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting and may include the text of a resolution that may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting. At any general meeting convened on such request, no business may be transacted except that stated by the requisition or proposed by the Board.\n\nShareholders may request the Directors to send a resolution to shareholders for consideration at an AGM, as provided by the UK Companies Act 2006. A valid request must be made by (i) members representing at least 5% of the paid-up capital of HSBC Holdings as carries the right of voting at its general meetings (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury shares), or (ii) at least 100 members who have a right to vote on the resolution at the AGM in question and hold shares in HSBC Holdings on which there has been paid up an average sum, per member, of at least \u00a3100.\n\nThe request must be received by HSBC Holdings not later than (i) six weeks before the AGM in question; or (ii) if later, the time at which the notice of AGM is published.\n\nA request may be in hard copy form or in electronic form, and must be authenticated by the person or persons making it. A request may be made in writing to HSBC Holdings at its UK address, referred to in the paragraph above or by sending an email to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association were last approved at the 2022 AGM.

        "page_content": "## Events after the balance sheet date\n\nFor details of events after the balance sheet date, see Note 39 on the financial statements.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThe Group is not party to any significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of the Group. The Group does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover bid.\n\n## Branches\n\nThe Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services through branches and offices in the UK and overseas.\n\n## Research and development activities\n\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new products and services within the global businesses.\n\n## Political donations\n\nHSBC does not make any political donations or incur political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words. We have no intention of altering this policy. However, the definitions of political donations, political parties, political organisations and political expenditure used in the UK Companies Act 2006 are very wide. As a result, they may cover routine activities that form part of the normal business activities of the Group and are an accepted part of engaging with stakeholders. To ensure that neither the Group nor any of its subsidiaries inadvertently breaches the UK Companies Act 2006, authority is sought from shareholders at the AGM to make political donations.\n\nHSBC provides administrative support to two political action committees ('PACs') in the US funded by voluntary political contributions by eligible employees. We do not control the PACs, and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a voluntary Board Finance Committee, which consists of contributing eligible employees. The PACs recorded combined political donations of $110,004 during 2023 (2022: $100,250).\n\n## Charitable contributions\n\nFor details of charitable contributions, see page 86.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, and for determining the level and type of risks the Group is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.\n\nTo meet this requirement and to discharge its obligations under the FCA Handbook and the PRA Rulebook, procedures have been designed: for safeguarding assets against unauthorised use or disposal; for maintaining proper accounting records; and for ensuring the reliability and usefulness of financial information used within the business or for publication.\n\nThese procedures provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement, errors, losses or fraud. They are designed to provide effective internal control within the Group and accord with the Financial Reporting Council's guidance for Directors, issued in 2014, on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting. The procedures have been in place throughout the year and up to 21 February 2024, the date of publication of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023.\n\nThe Board, the GRC and the GAC monitored the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control throughout the year. In particular, this focused on the Group's regulatory remediation and change programmes, and involved working closely with management to better prioritise and understand where there are key interdependencies. In 2024, continued focus will be placed on\n\noverseeing emerging risks and potential risks arising from new products and offerings.\n\nTo support the work of the Board, the GRC and the GAC in discharging their responsibilities in this regard, assurance was also provided by executive management confirming that a risk assessment had been undertaken and controls were in place to mitigate the risks arising from the Group's key activities. Necessary actions will be taken to remedy any failings or weaknesses identified from these activities and included the implementation of additional assurance procedures including in relation to the Group's externally driven ESG and climate-related disclosures, change programmes and regulatory reporting.\n\nThe key risk management and internal control procedures include the following:\n\n## Global Principles\n\nThe Group's Global Principles set an overarching standard for all policies and procedures and are fundamental to the Group's risk management structure. They inform and connect our purpose, values, strategy and risk management principles, guiding us to do the right thing and treat our customers and our colleagues fairly at all times. In 2024, the Global Principles will be replaced by a more concise and targeted version of the document, known as the HSBC Book.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nThe risk management framework supports our Global Principles, and going forward, our HSBC Book. It outlines the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks. It applies to all categories of risk and supports a consistent approach in identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities.\n\n## Delegation of authority within limits set by the Board\n\nSubject to certain matters reserved for the Board, the Group Chief Executive has been delegated authority limits and powers within which to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Group. A new delegation of authorities framework was implemented in April 2023 with the aim of providing a simpler Group structure within which the Board and its subsidiaries can manage their delegated powers. These delegated authorities can be used for the approval, signing and execution of specific written agreements and documents such as procurement contracts.\n\nThe delegation of authorities framework is either granted via a separate board resolution or power of attorney or is set out in the relevant Group policy with clear systems of control that are appropriate to the business or function. Authorities to enter into credit and market risk exposures are delegated with limits to line management of Group companies in line with Group policy. Credit and market risks are measured and reported at subsidiary company level and aggregated for risk concentration analysis on a Group-wide basis.\n\n## Risk identification and monitoring\n\nSystems and procedures are in place to identify, assess, control and monitor the material risk types facing HSBC as set out in the risk management framework. The Group's risk measurement and reporting systems are designed to help ensure that material risks are captured with all the attributes necessary to support well-founded decisions, that those attributes are accurately assessed and that information is delivered in a timely manner for those risks to be successfully managed and mitigated.\n\n## Changes in market conditions/practices\n\nProcesses are in place to identify new risks arising from changes in market conditions/practices or customer behaviours, which could expose the Group to heightened risk of loss or reputational damage.\n\nThe Group employs both a top and emerging risks process to provide forward-looking views of issues with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to long term.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in the reliability and resilience of our IT systems and critical services, including those provided by third parties, that support all parts of our business. We do so to help protect our customers, affiliates and counterparties, and to help",

        "page_content": "ensure that we minimise any disruption to services that could result in reputational and regulatory consequences. In our approach to defend against these threats, we invest in business and technical controls to help us detect, manage and recover from issues, including data loss, in a timely manner.\n\nWe continue our focus on the quality and timeliness of the data used to inform management decisions, through measures such as early warning indicators, prudent active risk management of our risk appetite, and ensuring regular communication with our Board and other key stakeholders.\n\n## Responsibility for risk management\n\nAll employees are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their role as part of the three lines of defence model. This is an activity-based model to delineate management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment. The second line of defence sets the policy and guidelines for managing specific risk areas, provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk, and challenges the first line of defence (the risk owners) on effective risk management.\n\nThe Board delegated authority to the GAC to annually review the independence, autonomy and effectiveness of the Group's policies and procedures on whistleblowing, including the procedures for the protection of staff who raise concerns of detrimental treatment.\n\n## Strategic plans\n\nStrategic plans are prepared for global businesses, global functions and geographical regions within the framework of the Group's overall strategy. Financial resource plans, informed by detailed analysis of risk appetite describing the types and quantum of risk that the Group is prepared to take in executing its strategy, are prepared and adopted by all major Group operating companies and set out the key business initiatives and the likely financial effects of those initiatives.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nHSBC is required to comply with section 404 of the US SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and assess its effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at 31 December 2023. In 2014, the GAC endorsed the adoption of the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO') 2013 framework for the monitoring of risk management and internal control systems to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act.\n\nThe primary mechanism through which comfort over risk management and internal control systems is achieved is through annual assessments of the effectiveness of controls to manage risk, and the reporting of issues on a regular basis through the various risk management and risk governance forums.\n\nThe key risk management and internal control procedures over financial reporting include the following:\n\n## Entity level controls\n\nEntity level controls are a defined suite of internal controls that have a pervasive influence over the entity as a whole and meet the principles of the COSO framework. They include controls related to the control environment, such as the Group's values and ethics, the promotion of effective risk management and the overarching governance exercised by the Board and its non-executive committees. The design and operational effectiveness of entity level controls are assessed on an ongoing basis. If issues are significant to the Group, they are escalated to the GRC and also to the GAC, if concerning financial reporting matters.\n\n## Process level transactional controls\n\nKey process level controls that mitigate the risk of financial misstatement are identified, recorded and monitored in accordance with the risk framework. This includes the identification and assessment of relevant control issues against which action plans are tracked through to remediation. Further details of HSBC's approach to risk management can be found on page 136. The GAC has continued to receive regular updates on HSBC's ongoing activities for improving\n\nthe effective oversight of end-to-end business processes, and management continued to identify opportunities for enhancing key controls, such as through the use of automation technologies.\n\n## Financial reporting controls\n\nThe Group's financial reporting process is controlled using documented accounting policies and reporting formats, supported by detailed instructions and guidance on reporting requirements, issued to all reporting entities within the Group in advance of each reporting period end. The submission of financial information from each reporting entity is supported by a certification by the responsible financial officer and analytical review procedures at reporting entity and Group levels.\n\n## Group Disclosure and Controls Committee\n\nChaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Disclosure and Controls Committee supports the discharge of the Group's obligations under relevant legislation and regulation including the UK and Hong Kong listing rules, the UK Market Abuse Regulation and US Securities and Exchange Commission rules. In so doing, the Group Disclosure and Controls Committee is empowered to determine whether a new event or circumstance should be disclosed, including the form and timing of such disclosure, and review certain material disclosures made or to be made by the Group. The membership of the Group Disclosure and Controls Committee consists of senior management, including the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Group Chief Legal Officer, and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. The Group's brokers, external auditors and its external legal counsel also attend as required. The integrity of disclosures is underpinned by structures and processes within the Global Finance and Group Risk and Compliance functions that support rigorous analytical review of financial reporting and the maintenance of proper accounting records. As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have certified that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at the end of the period covered by the Annual Report and Accounts 2023.\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control over financial reporting was conducted with reference to the COSO 2013 framework. Based on the assessment performed, the Directors concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n\nPwC has audited the effectiveness of HSBC's internal control over financial reporting and has given an unqualified opinion.\n\n## Other information included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n\nWe include other non-statutory information in the Annual Report and Accounts to enable a broader perspective of our performance for the period, including ESG and regulatory capital and liquidity information. We highlight on pages 43 and 267 that we are seeking to enhance our governance, process, systems and controls capabilities in both areas, although the scale and nature of the challenges differ between reporting areas. Our improvements in regulatory reporting are intended to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency and enhance controls in order to meet regulatory expectations. ESG reporting continues to evolve, with a lack of globally consistent metrics, taxonomies and best practices and a high reliance on external data. The GAC provides oversight to our reporting improvements in both areas, and is also focused on increasing the level of internal and external assurance in these areas, in line with wider market developments (set out on page 267).\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Board, having made appropriate enquiries, is satisfied that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, and it therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nFor further details, see page 40.",

        "page_content": "## Employees\n\nAt 31 December 2023, HSBC had a total workforce equivalent to 221,000 full-time employees compared with 219,000 at the end of 2022. Our main centres of employment were India with approximately 42,000 employees, the UK with 33,000, mainland China with 33,000, Hong Kong with 26,000, Mexico with 17,000 and France with 6,000.\n\nOur business spans many cultures, communities and continents. We aspire to provide a high-performing environment where our colleagues can fulfil their potential by building their skills and capabilities while focusing on the development of a diverse and inclusive culture. We use employee surveys to assess progress and make changes. We want to provide an open culture, where our colleagues feel connected and supported to speak up, and where our leaders encourage and use feedback. Where we make organisational changes, we support our colleagues, in particular where there are job impacts.\n\n## Employee relations\n\nWe consult with and, where appropriate, negotiate with employee representative bodies where we have them. It is our policy to maintain well-developed communications and consultation programmes with all employee representative bodies. There have been no material disruptions to our operations from labour disputes during the past five years.\n\nWe are committed to complying with the applicable employment laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in relation to working hours and rest periods. HSBC's global employment practices and relations policy provides the framework and controls through which we seek to uphold that commitment.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nOur customers, colleagues and communities span many cultures and continents. We value difference and believe that diversity makes us stronger. We are dedicated to building a diverse and connected workforce where everyone feels a sense of belonging.\n\nOur Group People Committee, which is made up of Group Executive Committee members, governs our diversity and inclusion agenda. It meets regularly to agree actions to improve diverse representation and build a more inclusive culture. Members of our Group Executive Committee are held to account for the actions they take on diversity via aspirational goals contained within their performance scorecards.\n\nWe expect all colleagues at HSBC to treat each other with dignity and respect to ensure an inclusive environment. Our policies make it clear that we do not tolerate unlawful discrimination, bullying or harassment on any grounds.\n\nTo align our approach to inclusion best practices, we participate in global diversity benchmarks that help us to identify improvement opportunities. We also track a large number of diversity and inclusion metrics, including those included in the Group executive scorecards, which enable us to identify inclusion barriers and take action where required. Our approach to diversity and inclusion is set out on page 76 alongside our goals and progress.\n\nFurther details of our diversity and inclusion activity, alongside our Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Reports 2023 , can be found at www.hsbc.com/diversitycommitments.\n\n## Employment of people with a disability\n\nWe strongly believe in providing equal opportunities for our employees. The employment of people with a disability is included in this commitment. We are committed to retaining disabled employees in the workplace and to providing reasonable adjustments to enable this.\n\n## Employee development\n\nWe aim to build a dynamic, inclusive culture where the best want to develop the skills and experiences that help them fulfil their potential. This determines how we develop our people and recruit, identify and nurture talent. A range of resources bring this to life including:\n\n- -HSBC University, our platform for learning and development with specific business and technical academies;\n- -our My HSBC Career portal, which offers career development information and resources; and\n- -HSBC Talent Marketplace, our online platform that uses AI to provide opportunities to learn as we work.\n\nEveryone at HSBC annually completes global mandatory training. It plays a critical role in shaping our culture by ensuring everyone is focused on issues that are fundamental to working at HSBC, from sustainability, to financial crime risk, to our intolerance of bullying and harassment.\n\nAs the opportunities we face change, we provide development to key groups of colleagues through business and technical academies. This includes our risk academy, which helps us to develop broad capabilities in traditional areas of risk like financial crime but also in emerging risk issues like climate risk and the ethics of AI and data.\n\nOur approach to learning is skills based. Our academies work with our businesses to identify the key skills and capabilities we need in the future. Alongside this, we help colleagues identify, assess and develop the skills that match their ambition and aspirations.\n\nOur platform for learning content is Degreed. This helps colleagues identify, assess and develop key skills through internal and external training materials in a way that suits them. Content can range from quick videos, articles or podcasts to packaged programmes or learning pathways.\n\nEffective people management and impactful leadership remain critical to our ability to energise for growth. In 2023 we have continued to focus on equipping our management population with the skills they need to lead the organisation and energise our colleagues. We have continued to run our Enterprise Leadership Programme for our most senior leaders and developed the Managing Director Leadership Programme further following the launch in 2022. We have also refreshed our People Management Excellence programme which is available to leaders at all levels of the organisation to help them manage colleagues and nurture a productive team.",

Our global health and safety performance is subject to ongoing monitoring and assurance to ensure we are compliant with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nOur chief operating officers have overall responsibility for engendering a positive health and safety culture and ensuring that global policies, procedures and systems are put into practice locally. They also have responsibility for ensuring all local legal requirements are met.\n\nWe delivered a range of programmes in 2023 to help us understand and manage our health and safety risks:\n\n- -We reinforced our advice and risk assessment and control methodology on working from home for employees adopting a hybrid work style, providing more awareness and best practices on good ergonomics and well-being.\n- -We delivered health and safety training and awareness to 235,000 of our employees and contractors globally, ensuring roles and responsibilities were clear and understood.\n- -We completed the annual safety inspection on all of our buildings globally, to ensure we were meeting our standards and continuously improving our safety performance.\n- -We maintained measures in our workplaces globally to minimise the risks from the spread of respiratory disease, including through the provision of hand sanitiser, improved ventilation, and guidance on good hygiene practices.\n- -We continued to focus on enhancing the safety culture in our supply chain through our SAFER Together programme, covering the five key elements of best practice safety culture, including speaking up about safety, and recognising excellence.\n- -We continued to provide our guidance and training programme for our construction partners, focusing on our key markets globally to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring by helping them understand and deliver industry-leading health and safety performance. More than 7,500 construction workers received safety passport training across 20 countries.\n- -In 2023, our Eat Well Live Well programme continued to promote healthier and more sustainable diets among our colleagues with 30% of global food sales from HSBC catering outlets comprising healthy options. We also extended the reach of our programme through the launch of increased plant-based offers, monthly events dedicated to Eat Well Live Well, and virtual teaching kitchens accessible to all our employees.\n\n- -Protection of our colleagues and operations is of critical importance, and we have effective controls in place to protect our people from natural disasters (such as storms and earthquakes).

Under that law, the Directors have prepared the parent company ('Company') and the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. The company has also prepared financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS Accounting Standards). Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group, and of the profit or loss of the Company and the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- -select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- -make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- -state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- -prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 as they appear on the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 2023, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 'Report of the Directors: Corporate governance report' on pages 239 to 243 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 , confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- -the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the Group; and\n- -the management report represented by the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee has responsibility, delegated to it from the Board, for overseeing all matters relating to external financial reporting. The Group Audit Committee report on page 266 sets out how the Group Audit Committee discharges its responsibilities.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nIn accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors' report includes a statement, in the case of each Director in office as at the date the Report of the Directors is approved, that:\n\n- -so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware; and\n- -they have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\nHSBC Holdings plc\n\nRegistered number 617987\n\n21 February 2024",

In addition to forming this opinion, in this report we have also provided information on how we approached the audit, how it changed from the previous year and details of the significant discussions that we had with the GAC.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- -Expected credit losses - Impairment of loans and advances (group)\n- -Impairment of investment in associate - Bank of Communications Co., Ltd ('BoCom') (group)\n- -Investments in subsidiaries (parent company)\n- -Valuation of defined benefit pension obligations (group)\n\n## Materiality\n\n- -Overall group materiality: US$1.6bn (2022: US$1bn) based on 5% of profit before tax adjusted for notable items.\n- -Overall parent company materiality: US$1.5bn (2022: US$950m) based on 0.75% of total assets. This would result in an overall materiality of US$2.1bn and was therefore reduced below the group materiality.\n- -Performance materiality: US$1.2bn (2022: US$750m) (group) and US$1.1bn (2022: US$712m) (parent company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nHeld for sale accounting (group), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because the risk has reduced following the completion of the sale of the retail banking operations in France. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of HSBC Holdings plc\n\nExpected credit losses - Impairment of loans and advances (group)\n\n## Nature of the key audit matter\n\nDetermining expected credit losses ('ECL') involves management judgement and is subject to a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nManagement makes various assumptions when estimating ECL. The significant assumptions that we focused on in our audit included those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on ECL. These included assumptions made in determining economic scenarios and their probability weightings (specifically the central and downside scenarios given these have the most material impact on ECL) and estimating discounted cash flows for material credit impaired exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nThe level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained high during 2023 as a result of the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, persistently high levels of inflation in some territories and the rising global interest rate environment, as well as developments in mainland China's commercial real estate sector and economy more broadly.\n\nMacroeconomic conditions vary between territories and industries, leading to uncertainty around judgements made in determining the severity and probability weighting of economic scenarios used in ECL models.\n\nThe modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL are developed using historical experience. The impact of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions has resulted in certain limitations in the reliability of these methodologies to forecast the extent and timing of future customer defaults and therefore estimate ECL. In addition, modelling methodologies do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as the differentiated impact of economic conditions on certain industry sectors. These limitations are addressed with management judgemental adjustments, the measurement of which is inherently judgemental and subject to estimation uncertainty.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe held discussions with the GAC covering governance and controls over ECL, with a significant focus on the uncertain prevailing macroeconomic conditions and developments in mainland China's commercial real estate sector. We discussed a number of areas, including:\n\n- -the severity of economic scenarios, and their related probability weightings, across territories;\n- -significant assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flow projections for defaulted exposures in relation to the mainland China commercial real estate portfolio;\n- -assumptions made in determining judgemental management adjustments; and\n- -the disclosures made in relation to ECL.\n\n## How our audit addressed our key audit matter\n\nWe assessed the design and effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL. We observed management's review and challenge in governance forums for (1) the determination of economic scenarios and their probability weightings, and (2) the assessment of ECL for Retail and Wholesale portfolios, including the assessment of management judgemental adjustments.\n\nWe also tested controls over:\n\n- -model validation and monitoring;\n- -the identification of credit impaired triggers;\n- -the input of critical data into source systems and the flow and transformation of critical data from source systems to impairment models and management judgemental adjustments;\n- -the calculation and approval of management judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes; and\n- -approval of significant individual impairments.\n\nWe involved our economic experts in assessing the significant assumptions made in determining the severity and probability weighting of economic scenarios. These assessments considered the sensitivity of ECL to variations in the severity and probability weighting of economic scenarios. We involved our modelling specialists in assessing the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and methodologies used for models and certain management judgemental adjustments. We independently re-performed the calculations for a sample of those models and certain management judgemental adjustments. In respect of the mainland China commercial real estate portfolio, we involved our business recovery experts in assessing the discounted cash flows for a sample of credit impaired exposures. We further considered whether the judgements made in selecting the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\n\nIn addition, we performed substantive testing over:\n\n- -the compliance of ECL methodologies and assumptions with the requirements of IFRS 9;\n- -a sample of critical data used in ECL models and to estimate management judgemental adjustments; and\n- -assumptions and critical data for a sample of credit impaired wholesale exposures.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the audited Credit Risk disclosures made in the Annual Report.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n\n- -Audited credit risk disclosures\n- -Group Audit Committee Report\n- -Note 1.2(d):Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n- -Note 1.2(i): Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets",

This is an indicator of potential impairment. An impairment test was performed by management, with supporting sensitivity analysis, using a value in use ('VIU') model. On this basis, the investment in BoCom was impaired by US$3.0bn. The carrying value of the investment in BoCom amounts to US$21.2bn at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe methodology applied in the VIU model is dependent on various assumptions, both short term and long term in nature. These assumptions, which are subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management's judgement, analysts' forecasts, market data or other relevant information.\n\nThe assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and subjectivity, and for which variations had the most significant impact on the VIU. Specifically, these significant assumptions included:\n\n- -the discount rate;\n- -short term assumptions for operating income growth rate, loans and advances to customers growth rate, cost-income ratio, and expected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to customers;\n- -long-term assumptions for profit and asset growth rates, expected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to customers, and effective tax rates; and\n- -capital related assumptions (risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets and capital adequacy ratios).\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed the appropriateness of the methodology, its consistent application period over period and significant assumptions with the GAC. We also discussed the disclosures made in relation to BoCom, including the use of sensitivity analysis to explain estimation uncertainty.\n\n## How our audit addressed our key audit matter\n\nWe had oversight of the audit work performed by our component audit team in Hong Kong in relation to the impairment assessment of BoCom. This work included:\n\n- -testing controls in place over the significant assumptions, the methodology and its consistent application period over period used to determine the VIU, assessing the appropriateness of the methodology used, its application, and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations;\n- -challenging the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and, where relevant, their interrelationships;\n- -obtaining evidence to corroborate and challenge the data supporting significant assumptions, which included past experience, external market information, third-party sources including analyst reports, information from BoCom management and historical publicly available BoCom financial information;\n- -determining a reasonable range for the discount rate assumption, with the assistance of our valuation experts, and comparing it to the discount rate used by management;\n- -assessing whether the judgements made in determining the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias; and\n- -evaluating and testing the disclosures in relation to BoCom in the Annual Report.\n\nWe observed certain meetings alongside the component auditor, management and BoCom management to identify facts and circumstances impacting significant assumptions relevant to the determination of the VIU.\n\nRepresentations were obtained from management that assumptions used were consistent with information currently available to the group.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n\n- -Group Audit Committee Report\n- -Note 1.2(a): Interests in associates and joint arrangements\n- -Note 18: Interests in associates and joint ventures",

Where indicators have been identified management estimated the recoverable amount using the higher of value in use ('VIU') or fair value less cost to sell.\n\nThe methodology used to estimate the recoverable amount is dependent on various assumptions, both short term and long term in nature. These assumptions, which are subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management's judgement, experts engaged by management and market data. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the recoverable amount. Specifically, these included:\n\n- -HSBC's business plan for 2024 to 2028 focusing on revenue, cost and expected credit loss forecasts;\n- -regulatory capital requirements;\n- -long term growth rates; and\n- -discount rates.\n\nManagement's assessment resulted in an impairment charge of US$5.5bn in relation to the investment in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited ('HOHU'), which is an intermediate holding company of certain businesses in North America. This resulted in investment in subsidiaries of US$159bn at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed the impairment charge for HOHU, the appropriateness of methodologies used and significant assumptions with the GAC, giving consideration to the macroeconomic outlook and HSBC's strategy.\n\n## How our audit addressed our key audit matter\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the effectiveness of controls in place over significant assumptions and the model used to determine the recoverable amounts. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, to estimate the recoverable amounts.\n\nIn respect of the significant assumptions, our testing included the following:\n\n- -challenging management's business plan and the prospects for HSBC's businesses, as well as considering the achievement of historic forecasts;\n- -obtaining and evaluating evidence relating to significant assumptions, from a combination of historical experience and external market and other financial information;\n- -assessing whether the cash flows included in the model were in compliance with the relevant accounting standard;\n- -assessing the sensitivity of the recoverable amount  to reasonable variations in significant assumptions, both individually and in aggregate; and\n- -determining a reasonable range for the discount rate used within the model, with the assistance of our valuation experts, and comparing it to the discount rate used by management.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to investment in subsidiaries.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n\n- -Group Audit Committee Report\n- -Note 1.2(a): Investments in subsidiaries\n- -Note 19: Investments in subsidiaries\n\nValuation of defined benefit pensions obligations (group)\n\n## Nature of the key audit matter\n\nThe group has a defined benefit obligation of US$27.0bn, of which US$19.8bn relates to HSBC Bank (UK) pension scheme ('the principal plan').\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation for the principal plan is dependent on a number of actuarial assumptions. Management uses an actuarial expert to determine the valuation of the defined benefit obligations. The valuation methodology uses a number of market based inputs and other financial and demographic assumptions. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the liability. Specifically, these included the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rate.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed with the GAC the methodologies and significant assumptions used by management to determine the value of the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## How our audit addressed our key audit matter\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the effectiveness of governance and controls in place over the methodologies and the significant assumptions, including those in relation to the use of management's experts. We also evaluated the objectivity and competence of management's expert involved in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation of the principal plan.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and tested the accuracy of the calculation, to estimate the liability. In respect of the significant assumptions, we used our actuarial experts to understand the judgements made by management and their actuarial expert in determining the significant assumptions and compared these assumptions to our independently compiled expected ranges based on market observable indices and the knowledge and opinions of our actuarial experts.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to the defined benefit pension obligation.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n\n- -Group Audit Committee Report\n- -Note 1.2(k): Post-employment benefit plans\n- -Note 5: Employee compensation and benefits",

        "page_content": "## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\n\nThe risks that HSBC faces are diverse, with the interdependencies between them being numerous and complex. In performing our risk assessment we engaged with a number of stakeholders to ensure we appropriately understood and considered these risks and their interrelationships. This included stakeholders within HSBC and our own experts within PwC. This engagement covered external factors across the geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory and accounting landscape, the impact of climate change risk as well as the internal environment at HSBC, driven by strategy and transformation.\n\nWe evaluated and challenged management's assessment of the impact of climate change risk, which is set out on page 44, including their conclusion that there is no material impact on the financial statements. In making this evaluation we considered management's use of stress testing and scenario analysis to arrive at the conclusion that there is no material impact on the financial statements. We considered management's assessment on the areas in the financial statements most likely to be impacted by climate risk, including:\n\n- -the impact on ECL on loans and advances to customers, for both physical and transition risk;\n- -the forecast cashflows from management's five year business plan and long term growth rates used in estimating recoverable amounts as part of impairment assessments of investments in subsidiaries, goodwill and intangible assets;\n- -the impact of climate related terms on the solely payments of principal and interest test for classification and measurement of loans and advances to customers; and\n- -climate risks relating to contingent liabilities as HSBC faces increased reputational, legal and regulatory risk as it progresses towards its climate ambition.\n\nHSBC's progress on their ESG targets is not included within the scope of this audit. We were engaged separately to provide independent limited assurance to the Directors over the following ESG data:\n\n- -the 2021 and 2022 on-balance sheet financed emissions for 6 sectors (page 61);\n- -the 2020 thermal coal financing drawn balance exposure (page 67) and the 2020 thermal coal mining on-balance sheet financed emissions (page 61);\n- -the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 off balance facilitated emissions for 2 sectors (page 61);\n- -the cumulative progress made by HSBC on providing and facilitating sustainable financing and investments (page 49); and\n- -HSBC's own operations scope 1, 2 and 3 (limited to business travel) greenhouse gas emissions data for 2023 (page 64); and supply chain greenhouse gas emissions for purchased goods and services, and capital goods for 2023 (page 64).\n\nThe work performed for a limited assurance report is substantially less than the work performed for our financial audit, which provides reasonable assurance.\n\n## Scoping\n\nThrough our risk assessment, we tailored our determination as to which entities and balances we needed to perform testing over to support our group opinion, taking into consideration the complex and disaggregated group structure, the accounting processes and controls as well as the industry in which they operate. The risks of material misstatement can be reduced to an acceptable level by testing the most financially significant entities within the group and those that drive particular significant risks identified as part of our risk assessment. This ensures that sufficient coverage has been obtained for each financial statement line item ('FSLI'). We continually assessed risks and changed the scope of our audit where necessary.\n\nOur risk assessment and scoping identified certain entities (collectively the 'Significant Subsidiaries') for which we obtained audit opinions. We obtained full scope audit opinions for the consolidated financial position and performance of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, and HSBC North America Holdings Inc. We also obtained full scope audit opinions for the company financial position and performance of HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Bank Canada and HSBC Mexico S.A. Banco. We obtained audit opinions over specific balances for HSBC Bank Middle East Limited - UAE Operations and the HSBC UK Bank plc group. The audits for HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc were performed by other PwC teams in the UK. All other audits were performed by other PwC network firms.\n\n## Group-wide audit approach\n\nHSBC has entity level controls that have a pervasive influence across the group, as well as other global and regional governance and controls over aspects of financial reporting, such as those operated by the Global Risk function for expected credit losses. A significant amount of IT and operational processes and controls relevant to financial reporting are undertaken in operations centres run by Digital Business Services ('DBS'). Whilst these operations centres are not separate components, the IT and operational processes and controls are relevant to the financial information of the Significant Subsidiaries. Financial reporting processes and controls are also performed centrally in HSBC's Group Finance function and finance operation centres ('Finance Operations'), including the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, held for sale classifications and the consolidation of the group's results, the preparation of financial statements, and management's oversight controls relevant to the group's financial reporting.\n\nGroup-wide processes or processes in DBS and Finance Operations are subject to specified audit procedures or an audit over specific FSLIs. These procedures primarily relate to testing of IT general controls, IT dependencies, forward looking economic scenarios for ECL, operating expenses, intangible assets, valuation of financial instruments, existence testing of financial instruments, intercompany eliminations, reconciliations and consolidation as well as payroll. For these areas, we either performed audit work ourselves, or directed and provided oversight of the audit work performed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Mexico and the Philippines. Some of this work was relied upon by the PwC teams auditing the Significant Subsidiaries. This audit work, together with analytical review procedures and assessing the outcome of local external audits, also mitigated the risk of material misstatement for balances in entities that were not part of a Significant Subsidiary.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of HSBC Holdings plc\n\n## Significant Subsidiaries audit approach\n\nIn March 2023, we held a meeting in Hong Kong with the partners and senior staff from the group audit team and certain PwC teams who undertake audits of the Significant Subsidiaries and the operations centres. The meeting focused primarily on our approach to auditing HSBC's businesses, changes at HSBC and in our PwC teams, and how we continue to innovate and improve the quality of the audit with a focus on technology and our global delivery model. We also discussed our significant audit risks.\n\nWe asked the partners and teams reporting to us on the Significant Subsidiaries to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size of the operations they audited. The overall materiality levels ranged from US$107m to US$1.0bn. Certain Significant Subsidiaries were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was a lower level than our allocated group materiality.\n\nWe designed global audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending, deposits and derivatives. These approaches were provided to the partners and teams performing audit testing for the Significant Subsidiaries.\n\nWe were in active dialogue throughout the year with the component auditors of the Significant Subsidiaries, including consideration of how they planned and performed their work. Senior members of our team undertook at least one in-person site visit where a full scope audit was requested and we had oversight over certain areas of audit work performed. We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management for each of these Significant Subsidiaries at the year end. The audit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in Hong Kong relied upon work performed by other teams in Hong Kong and the PwC network firms in India, mainland China and Singapore. Similarly, the audit of HSBC Bank plc in the UK relied upon work performed by other teams in the UK and the PwC network firms in France and Germany. We considered how the audit partners and teams for the Significant Subsidiaries instructed and provided oversight to the work performed in these locations. Collectively, Significant Subsidiaries covered 83% of total assets and 74% of total operating income.\n\n## Using the work of others\n\nWe have continued our use of evidence provided by others through our reliance on management assurance testing of certain controls across the group. This included testing of controls performed by management themselves in certain low risk areas including reconciliations and footnote disclosure controls. We re-performed a portion of the testing to ensure appropriate quality of testing, as well as assessing the competence and objectivity of those performing the testing.\n\nWe also used the work of PwC experts, for example economic experts for our work around the severity and probability weighting of macroeconomics variables as part of the expected credit loss allowance and actuaries on the estimates used in determining pension liabilities. An increasing number of controls are operated on behalf of HSBC by third parties. We obtained audit evidence from work that is scoped and provided by other auditors that are engaged by those third parties. For example, we obtained a report evidencing the testing of external systems and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                  | Financial statements - group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Financial statements - parent company                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality              | US$1.6bn (2022: US$1bn).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | US$1.5bn (2022: US$950m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| How we determined it             | 5% of profit before tax adjusted for notable items (2022:  adjusted profit before tax).                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 0.75% of total assets. This would result in an overall  materiality of US$2.1bn and was therefore reduced below  the group materiality.                                                                                                                            |\n| Rationale for benchmark  applied | We believe a standard benchmark of 5% of profit before  tax adjusted for notable items is an appropriate quantitative  indicator of materiality, although certain items could also be  material for qualitative reasons. This benchmark is  consistent with our approach for listed entities. | A benchmark of total assets has been used, as the parent  company's primary purpose is to act as a holding parent  company with investments in the group's subsidiaries, not  to generate operating profits and therefore a profit based  measure is not relevant. |\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to US$1.2bn (2022: US$750m) for the group financial statements and US$1.1bn (2022: US$712m) for the parent company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the GAC that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$80m (group audit) (2022: US$50m) and US$80m (parent company audit) (2022: US$50m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",

The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic report and Report of the Directors\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Report of the Directors.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the parent company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- -The directors' confirmation that they have carried out an appropriate assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- -The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- -The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group's and parent company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- -The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the group's and parent company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and",

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of financial crime laws and regulations and regulatory compliance, including regulatory reporting requirements and conduct of business, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax legislation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries in relation to cost targets, and management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- -review of correspondence with and reports from regulators, including the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA');\n- -reviewed reporting to the GAC and GRC in respect of compliance and legal matters;\n- -enquiries of management and review of internal audit reports, insofar as they related to the financial statements;\n- -obtain legal confirmations from legal advisors relating to material litigation and compliance matters;\n- -assessment of matters reported on the group's whistleblowing programmes and the results of management's investigation of such matters, insofar as they related to the financial statements;\n- -challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the determination of expected credit losses, the impairment assessment of the investment in BoCom, valuation of defined benefit pensions obligations, the impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries and valuation of financial instruments;\n- -obtaining confirmations from third parties to confirm the existence of a sample of transactions and balances; and\n- -identifying and testing journal entries, including those posted with certain descriptions, posted and approved by the same individual, backdated journals or posted by infrequent and unexpected users.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to",

        "page_content": "target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements in accordance with ISAs (UK) is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's and parent company's internal controls;\n- -evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management;\n- -conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- -evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- -obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group and parent company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group and parent company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- -we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- -adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- -certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- -the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the GAC, we were appointed by the members on 31 March 2015 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is nine years, covering the years ended 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2023.",

In 2023, a total net $0.1bn of credit was recognised in other operating income, reflecting the net asset value disposed under the final terms of sale. The $0.4bn impairment of goodwill recognised in the third quarter in 2022 has not been reversed.\n- 7   Other operating (expense)/income includes a loss on net monetary positions of $1,667m (2022: $678m; 2021: $576m) as a result of applying IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' and the disposal losses on capitalised Markets Treasury repositioning of $977m in 2023.\n- 8 Net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges also referred to as revenue.\n- 9   Includes depreciation of the right-of-use assets of $663m (2022: $717m; 2021: $878m).\n\n337\n\nHSBC Holdings income statement\n\n337 HSBC Holdings statement of comprehensive income\n\n338\n\nHSBC Holdings balance sheet\n\n339 HSBC Holdings statement of changes in equity\n\n340\n\nHSBC Holdings statement of cash flows",

Underlying assets supporting these contracts are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Under this option, only the amount that matches income or expenses recognised in profit or loss on underlying items is included in finance income or expenses, resulting in the elimination of income statement accounting mismatches. The remaining amount of finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts is recognised in other comprehensive income ('OCI').\n- 4 At 31 December 2023, retained earnings included 256,289,431 treasury shares (2022: 554,452,437; 2021: 558,397,704). These include treasury shares held within HSBC's insurance business's retirement funds for the benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee share schemes or bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Markets and Securities Services.\n- 5 In March 2023, HSBC Holdings issued $2,000m 8.000% contingent convertible securities on which there were $4m of external issue costs.\n- 6 In March 2023, HSBC Holdings redeemed $2,350m 6.250% contingent convertible securities. In September 2023, HSBC Holdings further redeemed \u20ac1,000m 6.000% and SGD750m 5.000% contingent convertible securities.\n- 7 At 31 December 2023, an impairment of $5,512m of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited was recognised, resulting in a permitted transfer of $5,130m from the merger reserve to retained earnings and a realisation of $382m shared-based payment reserve within retained earnings.\n- 8 In May 2023, HSBC Holdings announced a share buy-back of up to $2.0bn, which was completed in July 2023.

This was a result of improved profit forecasts for the UK tax group, which accelerated the expected utilisation of these losses and reduced uncertainty regarding their recoverability. The amounts recorded within profit before tax with respect to dividend income from subsidiaries and reversal of impairment of subsidiaries are not subject to tax.\n\n## HSBC Holdings statement of comprehensive income\n\n## for the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Profit for the year                                                                                                                       | 9,212     | 12,357    | 10,834    |\n| Other comprehensive income/(expense)                                                                                                      |           |           |           |\n| Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss:                                                                       |           |           |           |\n| Changes in fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value upon initial recognition arising from changes  in own credit risk | (124)     | 326       | 267       |\n| -  before income taxes                                                                                                                    | (166)     | 435       | 259       |\n| -  income taxes                                                                                                                           | 42        | (109)     | 8         |\n| Other comprehensive income/(expense) for the year, net of tax                                                                             | (124)     | 326       | 267       |\n| Total comprehensive income for the year                                                                                                   | 9,088     | 12,683    | 11,101    |",

Distributable reserves include the distributable portions of retained earnings and the merger reserve. Distributable reserves are reduced by ordinary dividend payments, distributions on additional tier 1 instruments, share buy-backs and impairments in investments in subsidiaries. They are increased by profits and the realisation of retained earnings or merger reserves upon impairment of an associated investment in subsidiary.\n- 2   At 31 December 2023, retained earnings included 20,018,490 ($100m) treasury shares (2022: 331,874,221 ($2,615m); 2021: 329,871,829 ($2,542m)).\n- 3 In March 2023, HSBC Holdings issued $2,000m 8.000% contingent convertible securities, on which there were $20m of issue costs.\n- 4 In May 2023, HSBC announced a share buy-back of up to $2.0bn, which was completed in July 2023. In August 2023, HSBC announced another share buy-back of up to $2.0bn, which was completed in October 2023. In October 2023, HSBC further announced a share buy-back of up to $3.0bn, which was completed in February 2024.\n- 5 In March 2023, HSBC Holdings redeemed $2,350m 6.250% contingent convertible securities. In September 2023, HSBC Holdings further redeemed \u20ac1,000m 6.000% and SGD750m 5.000% contingent convertible securities.\n- 6 At 31 December 2023, an impairment of $5,512m of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited was recognised, resulting in a permitted transfer of $5,130m from the merger reserve to retained earnings, and a realisation of $382m share-based payment reserve within retained earnings. In 2022, a part-reversal of the impairment resulted in a transfer from retained earnings back to the merger reserve of $2,499m (2021: $3,065m).",

At transition, the Group's total equity reduced by $10,459m.\n\nOn adoption of IFRS 17, balances based on IFRS 4, including the present value of in-force long-term insurance business ('PVIF') asset in relation to the upfront recognition of future profits of in-force insurance contracts, were derecognised. Insurance contract liabilities have been remeasured under IFRS 17 based on groups of insurance contracts, which include the fulfilment cash flows comprising the best estimate of the present value of the future cash flows (for example premiums and payouts for claims, benefits and expenses), together with a risk adjustment for non-financial risk, as well as the contractual service margin ('CSM'). The CSM represents the unearned profits that will be released and systematically recognised in insurance revenue as services are provided over the expected coverage period.\n\nIn addition, the Group has made use of the option under the standard to re-designate certain eligible financial assets held to support insurance contract liabilities, which were predominantly measured at amortised cost, as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, with comparatives restated from the transition date. The effects of adoption of IFRS 17 are set out in Note 38 with a description of the policy in Note 1.2(j).\n\nThe key differences between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 are summarised in the following table:\n\ntransferred\n\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|   401 | 22  Prepayments, accrued income and other assets                                                  |\n|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   401 | 23  Assets held for sale, liabilities of disposal groups held for  sale and business acquisitions |\n|   404 | 24  Trading liabilities                                                                           |\n|   404 | 25 Financial liabilities designated at fair value                                                 |\n|   404 | 26 Debt securities in issue                                                                       |\n|   405 | 27 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities                                                |\n|   405 | 28 Provisions                                                                                     |\n|   406 | 29 Subordinated liabilities                                                                       |\n|   407 | 30 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance  sheet commitments                    |\n|   412 | 31 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities                                       |\n|   414 | 32 Interest rate benchmark reform                                                                 |\n|   414 | 33 Called up share capital and other equity instruments                                           |\n|   416 | 34 Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and  guarantees                                |\n|   416 | 35 Finance lease receivables                                                                      |\n|   417 | 36 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters                                                       |\n|   420 | 37 Related party transactions                                                                     |\n|   422 | 38 Effects of adoption of IFRS 17                                                                 |\n|   426 | 39 Events after the balance sheet date                                                            |\n|   426 | 40 HSBC Holdings' subsidiaries, joint ventures and  associates                                    |",

When the FRA is impracticable such as when there is a lack of sufficient and reliable data, an entity has an accounting policy choice to use either the modified retrospective approach ('MRA') or the fair value approach ('FVA'). The Group has applied the FRA for new business from 2018 at the earliest, subject to practicability, and the FVA for the majority of contracts for which the FRA is impracticable.\n\nUnder the FVA, the valuation of insurance liabilities on transition is based on the applicable requirements of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. This requires consideration of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The CSM is calculated as the difference between what a market participant would demand for assuming the unexpired risk associated with insurance contracts, including required profit, and the fulfilment cash flows that are determined using IFRS 17 principles.\n\nIn determining the fair value, the Group considered the estimated profit margin that a market participant would demand in return for assuming the insurance liabilities with the consideration of the level of capital that a market participant would be required to hold, and the discount rate with an allowance for an illiquidity premium that takes into account the level of 'matching' between the Group's assets and related liabilities. These assumptions were set taking into account the assumptions that a hypothetical market participant operating in each local jurisdiction would consider.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules'\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') issued amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules', which became effective immediately and were approved for adoption by all members of the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023 and by the European Union on 8 November 2023. On 20 June 2023, legislation was substantively enacted in the UK to introduce the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax rules and a UK qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, with effect from 1 January 2024. The Group has applied the IAS 12 exception from recognising and disclosing information on associated deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThere were no other new standards or amendments to standards that had an effect on these financial statements.\n\n## (b)    Differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThere are no significant differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards in terms of their application to HSBC, and consequently there would be no significant differences had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The 'Notes on the financial statements', taken together with the 'Report of the Directors', include the aggregate of all disclosures necessary to satisfy IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n## (c) Future accounting developments\n\n## Minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards\n\nThe IASB has published a number of minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective from 1 January 2024. HSBC expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings. Additionally, in August 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 21 'Lack of Exchangeability' effective from 1 January 2025. The Group is undertaking an assessment of the potential impact, which is not expected to be significant.",

        "page_content": "## (d) Foreign currencies\n\nHSBC's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business. The US dollar is also HSBC Holdings' functional currency because the US dollar and currencies linked to it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events and conditions of its subsidiaries, as well as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, except non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost, which are translated using the rate of exchange at the initial transaction date. Exchange differences are included in other comprehensive income or in the income statement depending on where the gain or loss on the underlying item is recognised. Except for subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies (see Note 1.2(p)), in the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars are translated into the Group's presentation currency at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while their results are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## (e) Presentation of information\n\nCertain disclosures required by IFRS Accounting Standards have been included in the sections marked as ('Audited') in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 as follows:\n\n- -Disclosures concerning the nature and extent of risks relating to insurance contracts and financial instruments are included in the 'Risk review' on pages 135 to 237.\n- -The 'Own funds disclosure' is included in the 'Risk review' on page 207.\n\nHSBC follows the UK Finance Disclosure Code. The UK Finance Disclosure Code aims to increase the quality and comparability of UK banks' disclosures and sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance agreed in 2010. In line with the principles of the UK Finance Disclosure Code, HSBC assesses good practice recommendations issued from time to time by relevant regulators and standard setters, and will assess the applicability and relevance of such guidance, enhancing disclosures where appropriate.\n\n## (f) Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and judgements about future conditions. In view of the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of items, highlighted as the 'critical estimates and judgements' in section 1.2 below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management's estimates are based. This could result in materially different estimates and judgements from those reached by management for the purposes of these financial statements. Management's selection of HSBC's accounting policies that contain critical estimates and judgements reflects the materiality of the items to which the policies are applied and the high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty involved.\n\nManagement has considered the impact of climate-related risks on HSBC's financial position and performance. While the effects of climate change are a source of uncertainty, as at 31 December 2023 management did not consider there to be a material impact on our critical judgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short to medium term. In particular management has considered the known and observable potential impacts of climate-related risks of associated judgements and estimates in our value in use calculations.\n\n## (g) Going concern\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, liquidity, capital requirements and capital resources.\n\nThese considerations include stressed scenarios that reflect the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment following rising inflation, slower Chinese economic activity, and disrupted supply chains as a result of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars. They also included other top and emerging risks, including climate change, as well as the related impacts on profitability, capital and liquidity.\n\n## 1.2 Summary of material accounting policies\n\n## (a) Consolidation and related policies\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nWhere an entity is governed by voting rights, HSBC consolidates when it holds - directly or indirectly - the necessary voting rights to pass resolutions by the governing body. In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities, and whether power is held as agent or principal.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. This election is made for each business combination.\n\nHSBC Holdings' investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses.\n\nImpairment testing is performed where there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant investment to its carrying amount. Indicators of impairment include both external and internal sources of information. Similarly, assessments are made as to whether an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Where this is the case, such an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the relevant recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, and to the extent that it does not increase the carrying amount above that had no impairment loss been previously recognised.",

Where such circumstances are  determined to exist, management re-tests for  impairment or reversal more frequently than once a  year when indicators exist. This ensures that the  assumptions on which the cash flow forecasts are  based continue to reflect current market conditions  and management's best estimate of future  business prospects. | - The future cash flows of each investment are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the  periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term  pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter. Forecasts are compared with actual performance  and verifiable economic data, but they reflect management's view of future business  prospects at the time of the assessment. - The rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their  valuation, and are based on the costs of equity assigned to the investment. The cost of equity  percentage is generally derived from a capital asset pricing model and the market implied cost  of equity, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables,  including the risk-free interest rate in the country concerned and a premium for the risk of the |\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units ('CGUs') for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. HSBC's CGUs are based on its main legal entities subdivided by global business, except for Global Banking and Markets, for which goodwill is monitored on a global basis.\n\nImpairment testing is performed at least once a year, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.\n\nGoodwill is included in a disposal group if the disposal group is a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated or it is an operation within such a CGU. The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe review of goodwill and non-financial assets (see Note 1.2(n)) for impairment reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows:\n\n## Judgements\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill in the next financial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental.\n\n## HSBC sponsored structured entities\n\nHSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing that entity or in bringing together relevant counterparties so the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. HSBC is generally not considered a sponsor if the only involvement with the entity is merely administrative.\n\n## Interests in associates and joint arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control. Depending on HSBC's rights and obligations, the joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture.\n\nHSBC classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, as associates.\n\nHSBC recognises its share of the assets, liabilities and results in a joint operation. Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates is included in the consolidated financial statements of HSBC based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-rated amounts adjusted for any material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 31 December.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired, by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant investment to its carrying amount. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment. Previously recognised impairments are assessed for reversal when there are indicators that they may no longer exist or have",

However, as an exception to this, interest on debt instruments issued by HSBC for funding purposes that are designated under the fair value option to reduce an accounting mismatch and on derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt instruments is included in interest expense.\n\nInterest on credit-impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount of the asset less allowance for expected credit losses).\n\n## Non-interest income and expense\n\nHSBC generates fee income from services provided at a fixed price over time, such as account service and card fees, or when HSBC delivers a specific transaction at a point in time, such as broking services and import/export services. With the exception of certain fund management and performance fees, all other fees are generated at a fixed price. Fund management and performance fees can be variable depending on the size of the customer portfolio and HSBC's performance as fund manager. Variable fees are recognised when all uncertainties are resolved. Fee income is generally earned from short-term contracts with payment terms that do not include a significant financing component.\n\nHSBC acts as principal in the majority of contracts with customers, with the exception of broking services. For most brokerage trades, HSBC acts as agent in the transaction and recognises broking income net of fees payable to other parties in the arrangement.\n\nHSBC recognises fees earned on transaction-based arrangements at a point in time when it has fully provided the service to the customer. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.\n\nWhere HSBC offers a package of services that contains multiple non-distinct performance obligations, such as those included in account service packages, the promised services are treated as a single performance obligation. If a package of services contains distinct performance obligations, the corresponding transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices.\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities.\n\nNet income/(expense) from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes the following:\n\n- -'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis': This comprises net trading income, which includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading and other financial instruments managed on a fair value basis, together with the related interest income, expense and dividends, excluding the effect of changes in the credit risk of liabilities managed on a fair value basis. It also includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n- -'Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss': This includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value, together with related interest income, expense and dividends in respect of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and those derivatives managed in conjunction with the above that can be separately identifiable from other trading derivatives.\n- -'Changes in fair value of designated debt instruments and related derivatives': Interest paid on debt instruments and interest cash flows on related derivatives is presented in interest expense where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch.\n- -'Changes in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss': This includes interest on instruments that fail the solely payments of principal and interest test, see (d) below.\n\nThe accounting policies for insurance service result and insurance finance income/(expenses) are disclosed in Note 1.2(j).\n\n## (c) Valuation of financial instruments\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, HSBC recognises the difference as a trading gain or loss at inception (a 'day 1 gain or loss'). In all other cases, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures, is closed out, the valuation inputs become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction. The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where HSBC manages a group of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis but the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRS offsetting criteria.",

Such financial assets include most loans and advances to banks and customers and some debt securities. In addition, most financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. HSBC accounts for regular way amortised cost financial instruments using trade date accounting. The carrying amount of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transactions costs.\n\nHSBC may commit to underwriting loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time. When the loan arising from the lending commitment is expected to be sold shortly after origination, the commitment to lend is recorded as a derivative. When HSBC intends to hold the loan, the loan commitment is included in the impairment calculations set out below.\n\n## Non-trading reverse repurchase, repurchase and similar agreements\n\nWhen debt securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price ('repos'), they remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell ('reverse repos') are not recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non-trading repos and reverse repos are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the purchase and resale price is treated as interest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement.\n\nContracts that are economically equivalent to reverse repo or repo agreements (such as sales or purchases of debt securities entered into together with total return swaps with the same counterparty) are accounted for similarly to, and presented together with, reverse repo or repo agreements.\n\n## (e) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets managed within a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI'). These comprise primarily debt securities. They are recognised on trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements to purchase and are generally derecognised when they are either sold or redeemed. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value with changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Upon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as 'Gains less losses from financial instruments'. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are included in the impairment calculations set out below and impairment is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (f) Equity securities measured at fair value with fair value movements presented in other comprehensive income\n\nThe equity securities for which fair value movements are shown in other comprehensive income are business facilitation and other similar investments where HSBC holds the investments other than to generate a capital return. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit or loss. Gains or losses on the derecognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. Otherwise, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (g) Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out below and are so designated irrevocably at inception:\n\n- -The use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.\n- -A group of financial assets and liabilities or a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.\n- -The financial liability contains one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.\n\nDesignated financial assets are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when the rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred. Designated financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on settlement date, and are normally derecognised when extinguished. Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis' or 'Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss' or 'Changes in fair value of designated debt and related derivatives' except for the effect of changes in the liabilities' credit risk, which is presented in 'Other comprehensive income', unless that treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.\n\nUnder the above criteria, the main classes of financial instruments designated by HSBC are:\n\n- -Debt instruments for funding purposes that are designated to reduce an accounting mismatch: The interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain fixed-rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain swaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.",

        "page_content": "- -Financial assets and financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts: A contract under which HSBC does not accept significant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, other than investment contracts with discretionary participation features ('DPF'), but is accounted for as a financial liability. Customer liabilities under linked and certain non-linked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds or by a valuation method. The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and reported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows changes in fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line.\n- -Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.\n\n## (h)    Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other indices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial liabilities, which are bifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis.\n\nWhere the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch, the contractual interest is shown in 'Interest expense' together with the interest payable on the issued debt.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhen derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge accounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC uses these derivatives or, where allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nFair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but results in recognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise be recognised in the income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to the income statement on a recalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised immediately in the income statement within 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis'. The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and other gains and losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement on the disposal, or part-disposal, of the foreign operation.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nNon-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not applied.\n\n## (i) Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets\n\nExpected credit losses ('ECL') are recognised for loans and advances to banks and customers, non-trading reverse repurchase agreements, other financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is recognised for ECL resulting from possible default events within the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is recognised for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL'). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be 'stage 1'; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, and so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired are in 'stage 3'. Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets ('POCI') are treated differently as set out below.\n\n## Credit impaired (stage 3)\n\nHSBC determines that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days, there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay such as that a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial condition, or the loan is otherwise considered to be in default.\n\nIf such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise credit impaired.\n\nInterest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount less allowance for ECL).",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\n## Write-off\n\nFinancial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nLoans are identified as forborne and classified as either performing or non-performing when HSBC modifies the contractual terms due to financial difficulty of the borrower. Non-performing forborne loans are stage 3 and classified as non-performing until they meet the curing criteria, as specified by applicable credit risk policy (for example, when the loan is no longer in default and no other indicators of default have been present for at least 12 months). Any amount written off as a result of any modification of contractual terms upon entering forbearance would not be reversed.\n\nThe Group applies the EBA Guidelines on the application of definition of default for our retail portfolios, which affect credit risk policies and our reporting in respect of the status of loans as credit impaired principally due to forbearance (or curing thereof). Further details are provided under 'Forborne loans and advances' on page 148.\n\nPerforming forborne loans are initially stage 2 and remain classified as forborne until they meet applicable curing criteria (for example, they continue to not be in default and no other indicators of default are present for a period of at least 24 months). At this point, the loan is either stage 1 or stage 2 as determined by comparing the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms) and the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).\n\nA forborne loan is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms, or if the terms of an existing agreement are modified such that the forborne loan is a substantially different financial instrument. Any new loans that arise following derecognition events in these circumstances would generally be classified as POCI and will continue to be disclosed as forborne.\n\n## Loan modifications other than forborne loans\n\nLoan modifications that are not identified as forborne are considered to be commercial restructurings. Where a commercial restructuring results in a modification (whether legalised through an amendment to the existing terms or the issuance of a new loan contract) such that HSBC's rights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised at fair value. The rights to cash flows are generally considered to have expired if the commercial restructuring is at market rates and no payment-related concession has been provided. Modifications of certain higher credit risk wholesale loans are assessed for derecognition, having regard to changes in contractual terms that either individually or in combination are judged to result in a substantially different financial instrument. Mandatory and general offer loan modifications that are not borrower specific, for example market-wide customer relief programmes, generally do not result in derecognition, but their stage allocation is determined considering all available and supportable information under our ECL impairment policy. Changes made to these financial instruments that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate benchmark reform do not result in the derecognition or a change in the carrying amount of the financial instrument, but instead require the effective interest rate to be updated to reflect the change of the interest rate benchmark.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (stage 2)\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The assessment explicitly or implicitly compares the risk of default occurring at the reporting date compared with that at initial recognition, taking into account reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events, current conditions and future economic conditions. The assessment is unbiased, probability-weighted, and to the extent relevant, uses forward-looking information consistent with that used in the measurement of ECL. The analysis of credit risk is multifactor. The determination of whether a specific factor is relevant and its weight compared with other factors depends on the type of product, the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the geographical region. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a single set of criteria that will determine what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk, and these criteria will differ for different types of lending, particularly between retail and wholesale. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, all financial assets are deemed to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk when 30 days past due. In addition, wholesale loans that are individually assessed, which are typically corporate and commercial customers, and included on a watch or worry list, are included in stage 2.\n\nFor wholesale portfolios, the quantitative comparison assesses default risk using a lifetime probability of default ('PD'), which encompasses a wide range of information including the obligor's customer risk rating ('CRR'), macroeconomic condition forecasts and credit transition probabilities. For origination CRRs up to 3.3, significant increase in credit risk is measured by comparing the average PD for the remaining term estimated at origination with the equivalent estimation at the reporting date. The quantitative measure of significance varies depending on the credit quality at origination as follows:\n\n| Origination CRR   | Significance trigger - PD to increase by   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 0.1-1.2           | 15bps                                      |\n| 2.1-3.3           | 30bps                                      |\n\nFor CRRs greater than 3.3 that are not impaired, a significant increase in credit risk is considered to have occurred when the origination PD has doubled. The significance of changes in PD was informed by expert credit risk judgement, referenced to historical credit migrations and to relative changes in external market rates.",

In the absence of this data, origination PD must be approximated assuming through-the-cycle PDs and through-the-cycle migration probabilities, consistent with the instrument's underlying modelling approach and the CRR at origination. For these loans, the quantitative comparison is supplemented with additional CRR deteriorationbased thresholds, as set out in the table below:\n\n| Origination CRR   | Additional significance criteria - number of CRR grade notches  deterioration required to identify as significant credit  deterioration (stage 2) (> or equal to)   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0.1               | 5 notches                                                                                                                                                           |\n| 1.1-4.2           | 4 notches                                                                                                                                                           |\n| 4.3-5.1           | 3 notches                                                                                                                                                           |\n| 5.2-7.1           | 2 notches                                                                                                                                                           |\n| 7.2-8.2           | 1 notch                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 8.3               | 0 notch                                                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Further information about the 23-grade scale used for CRR can be found on page 148.\n\nFor retail portfolios, default risk is assessed using a reporting date 12-month PD derived from internal models, which incorporate all available information about the customer. This PD is adjusted for the effect of macroeconomic forecasts for periods longer than 12 months and is considered to be a reasonable approximation of a lifetime PD measure. Retail exposures are first segmented into homogenous portfolios, generally by country, product and brand. Within each portfolio, the stage 2 accounts are defined as accounts with an adjusted 12-month PD greater than the average 12-month PD of loans in that portfolio 12 months before they become 30 days past due. The expert credit risk judgement is that no prior increase in credit risk is significant. This portfolio-specific threshold therefore identifies loans with a PD higher than would be expected from loans that are performing as originally expected and higher than that which would have been acceptable at origination. It therefore approximates a comparison of origination to reporting date PDs.\n\nWe continue to refine the retail transfer criteria approach for certain portfolios as additional data becomes available, in order to utilise a more relative approach. These enhancements take advantage of the increase in origination-related data in the assessment of significant increases in credit risk by comparing remaining lifetime PD to the comparable remaining term lifetime PD at origination based on portfolio-specific origination segments.\n\n## Unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk (stage 1)\n\nECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL') are recognised for financial instruments that remain in stage 1.\n\n## Purchased or originated credit impaired\n\nFinancial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses are considered to be POCI. This population includes new financial instruments recognised in most cases following the derecognition of forborne loans. The amount of change in lifetime ECL for a POCI loan is recognised in profit or loss until the POCI loan is derecognised, even if the lifetime ECL are less than the amount of ECL included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## Movement between stages\n\nFinancial assets can be transferred between the different categories (other than POCI) depending on their relative increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Financial instruments are transferred out of stage 2 if their credit risk is no longer considered to be significantly increased since initial recognition based on the assessments described above. In the case of non-performing forborne loans, such financial instruments are transferred out of stage 3 when they no longer exhibit any evidence of credit impairment and meet the curing criteria as described above.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nThe assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money and considers other factors such as climate-related risks.\n\nIn general, HSBC calculates ECL using three main components: a probability of default ('PD'), a loss given default ('LGD') and the exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD instead. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nThe EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.",

For the wholesale methodology, the lifetime PD also takes into account credit migration, i.e. a customer migrating through the CRR bands over its life.\n\nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined primarily on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow ('DCF') methodology. The expected future cash flows are based on estimates as of the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future recoveries and expected future receipts of interest.\n\nCollateral is taken into account if it is likely that the recovery of the outstanding amount will include realisation of collateral based on its estimated fair value of collateral at the time of expected realisation, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral.\n\nThe cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation of the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under up to four different scenarios are probability-weighted by reference to the status of the borrower, economic scenarios applied more generally by the Group and judgement in relation to the likelihood of the work-out strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases where an individual assessment is undertaken, the effect of different economic scenarios and work-out strategies results in an ECL calculation based on a most likely outcome which is adjusted to capture losses resulting from less likely but possible outcomes. For certain less significant cases, the bank may use a LGD-based modelled approach to ECL assessment, which factors in a range of economic scenarios.\n\n## Period over which ECL is measured\n\nExpected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring ECL (be it 12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which HSBC is exposed to credit risk. However, where the financial instrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not serve to limit HSBC's exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, the contractual period does not determine the maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period HSBC remains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit risk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards, where the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to default or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio basis and ranging from between two and six years. In addition, for these facilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a provision. For wholesale overdraft facilities, credit risk management actions are taken no less frequently than on an annual basis.\n\n## Forward-looking economic inputs\n\nHSBC applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions representative of its view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected credit losses in most economic environments. In certain economic environments, additional analysis may be necessary and may result in additional scenarios or adjustments, to reflect a range of possible economic outcomes sufficient for an unbiased estimate. The detailed methodology is disclosed in 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 156.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe calculation of the Group's ECL under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:\n\n## Judgements\n\n## Estimates\n\n- -Defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk\n- -Determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of overdrafts and credit cards\n- -Selecting and calibrating the PD, LGD and EAD models, which support the calculations, including making reasonable and supportable judgements about how models react to current and future economic conditions\n- -Selecting model inputs and economic forecasts, including determining whether sufficient and appropriately weighted economic forecasts are incorporated to calculate unbiased expected credit loss\n- -Making management adjustments to account for late-breaking events, model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit judgements\n- -Selecting applicable recovery strategies for certain wholesale credit-impaired loans\n\n- -The section 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates', marked as audited from page 156, sets out the assumptions used in determining ECL, and provides an indication of the sensitivity of the result to the application of different weightings being applied to different economic assumptions",

        "page_content": "## (j)   Insurance contracts\n\nA contract is classified as an insurance contract where the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to compensate that party if it is adversely affected by a specified uncertain future event. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but is accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. In addition, the Group issues investment contracts with DPF, which are also accounted under IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\n## Aggregation of insurance contracts\n\nIndividual insurance contracts that are managed together and subject to similar risks are identified as a portfolio. Contracts that are managed together usually belong to the same product group, and have similar characteristics such as being subject to a similar pricing framework or similar product management, and are issued by the same legal entity. If a contract is exposed to more than one risk, the dominant risk of the contract is used to assess whether the contract features similar risks. Each portfolio is further separated by the contract's expected profitability. The portfolios are split by their profitability into: (i) contracts that are onerous at initial recognition; (ii) contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and (iii) the remaining contracts. These profitability groups are then divided by issue date, with most contracts the Group issues after the transition date being grouped into calendar quarter cohorts. For multi-currency groups of contracts, the Group considers its groups of contracts as being denominated in a single currency.\n\nThe measurement of the insurance contract liability is based on groups of insurance contracts as established at initial recognition, and will include fulfilment cash flows as well as the CSM representing the unearned profit. The Group has elected to update the estimates used in the measurement on a year-to-date basis.\n\n## Fulfilment cash flows\n\nThe fulfilment cash flows comprise the following:\n\n## Best estimates of future cash flows\n\nThe cash flows within the contract boundary of each contract in the Group include amounts expected to be collected from premiums and payouts for claims, benefits and expenses, and are projected using a range of scenarios and assumptions in an unbiased way based on the Group's demographic and operating experience along with external mortality data where the Group's own experience data is not sufficiently large in size to be credible.\n\n## Adjustment for the time value of money and financial risks associated with the future cash flows\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows are adjusted to reflect the time value of money (i.e. discounting) and the financial risks to derive an expected present value. The Group generally makes use of stochastic modelling techniques in the estimation for products with options and guarantees.\n\nA bottom-up approach is used to determine the discount rate to be applied to a given set of expected future cash flows. This is derived as the sum of the risk-free yield and an illiquidity premium. The risk-free yield is determined based on observable market data, where such markets are considered to be deep, liquid and transparent. When information is not available, management judgement is applied to determine the appropriate risk-free yield. Illiquidity premiums reflect the liquidity characteristics of the associated insurance contracts.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. It is calculated as a 75th percentile level of stress over a one-year period. The level of the stress is determined with reference to external regulatory stresses and internal economic capital stresses.\n\nFor the main insurance manufacturing entity in these locations, the one-year 75th percentile level of stress corresponds to the following percentiles based on an ultimate view of risk over all future years:\n\n- -Asia-Pacific (Hong Kong): 60th percentile (2022: 59th percentile).\n- -Europe (France): 60th percentile (2022: 60th percentile).\n- -Latin America (Mexico): 65th percentile (2022: 66th percentile).\n\nThe Group does not disaggregate changes in the risk adjustment between insurance service result (comprising insurance revenue and insurance service expense) and insurance finance income or expenses. All changes are included in the insurance service result.\n\n## Measurement models\n\nThe variable fee approach ('VFA') measurement model is used for most of the contracts issued by the Group, which is mandatory upon meeting the following eligibility criteria at inception:\n\n- -the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- -the Group expects to pay to the policyholder a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items. The Group considers that a substantial share is a majority of returns; and\n- -the Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items. The Group considers that a substantial proportion is a majority proportion of change on a present value probabilityweighted average of all scenarios.\n\nFor some contracts measured under VFA, the other comprehensive income ('OCI') option is used. The OCI option is applied where the underlying items held by the Group are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Under this option, only the amount that matches income or expenses recognised in profit or loss on underlying items is included in finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts, and hence results in the elimination of accounting mismatches. The remaining amount of finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts issued for the period is recognised in OCI. In addition, the risk mitigation option is used for a number of economic offsets against the instruments that meet specific requirements.\n\nThe remaining contracts issued and the reinsurance contracts held are accounted for under the general measurement model ('GMM').",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\n## CSM and coverage units\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit and results in no income or expense at initial recognition when the group of contracts is profitable. The CSM is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period for changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service (e.g. changes in noneconomic assumptions, including mortality and morbidity rates). For initial recognition of onerous groups of contracts and when groups of contracts become onerous subsequently, losses are recognised in insurance service expense immediately.\n\nFor groups of contracts measured using the VFA, changes in the Group's share of the underlying items, and economic experience and economic assumption changes adjust the CSM, whereas these changes do not adjust the CSM under the GMM, but are recognised in profit or loss as they arise. However, under the risk mitigation option for VFA contracts, the changes in the fulfilment cash flows and the changes in the Group's share in the fair value return on underlying items that the instruments mitigate are not adjusted in CSM but recognised in profit or loss. The risk mitigating instruments are primarily reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe CSM is systematically recognised in insurance revenue to reflect the insurance contract services provided, based on the coverage units of the group of contracts. Coverage units are determined by the quantity of benefits and the expected coverage period of the contracts.\n\nThe Group identifies the quantity of the benefits provided as follows:\n\n- -Insurance coverage: This is based on the expected net policyholder insurance benefit at each period after allowance for decrements, where net policyholder insurance benefit refers to the amount of sum assured less the fund value or surrender value.\n- -Investment services (including both investment-return service and investment-related service): This is based on a constant measure basis which reflects the provision of access for the policyholder to the facility.\n\nFor contracts that provide both insurance coverage and investment services, coverage units are weighted according to the expected present value of the future cash outflows for each service.\n\n## Insurance service result\n\nInsurance revenue reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the provision of coverage and other insurance contract services (excluding any investment components). Insurance service expenses comprise the incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expenses (excluding any investment components), and losses on onerous groups of contracts and reversals of such losses.\n\n## Insurance finance income and expenses\n\nInsurance finance income and expenses comprise the change in the carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts arising from the effects of the time value of money, financial risk and changes therein. For VFA contracts, changes in the fair value of underlying items (excluding additions and withdrawals) are recognised in insurance finance income or expenses.\n\n## (k) Employee compensation and benefits\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nHSBC enters into both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment arrangements with its employees as compensation for the provision of their services.\n\nThe vesting period for these schemes may commence before the legal grant date if the employees have started to render services in respect of the award before the legal grant date, where there is a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Expenses are recognised when the employee starts to render service to which the award relates.\n\nCancellations result from the failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period, and are treated as an acceleration of vesting recognised immediately in the income statement. Failure to meet a vesting condition by the employee is not treated as a cancellation, and the amount of expense recognised for the award is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest.\n\n## Post-employment benefit plans\n\nHSBC operates a number of pension schemes including defined benefit, defined contribution and post-employment benefit schemes.\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as the employees render service.\n\nDefined benefit pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability, and is presented in operating expenses. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets (see Note 1.2(c)), after applying the asset ceiling test, where the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe costs of obligations arising from other post-employment plans are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe most significant critical estimates relate to the determination of key assumptions applied in calculating the defined benefit pension obligation for the principal plan.\n\n| Judgements   | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|              | - A range of assumptions could be applied, and different assumptions could  significantly alter the defined benefit obligation and the amounts recognised in  profit or loss or OCI.                                                                                                |\n|              | - The calculation of the defined benefit pension obligation includes assumptions with  regard to the discount rate, inflation rate, pension payments and deferred  pensions, pay and mortality.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same statement as the related item appears.\n\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year and on any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled.\n\nIn assessing the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profit, management considers the availability of evidence to support the recognition of deferred tax assets, taking into account the inherent risks in long-term forecasting, including climate change-related, and drivers of recent history of tax losses where applicable. Management also considers the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are calculated based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\n## The recognition of deferred tax assets depends on judgements and estimates.\n\n| Judgements                                                                    | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| - Specific judgements supporting deferred tax assets are described in Note 7. | - The recognition of deferred tax assets is sensitive to estimates of  future cash flows projected for periods for which detailed forecasts  are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of  cash flows thereafter, on which forecasts of future taxable profit are  based, and which affect the expected recovery periods and the  pattern of utilisation of tax losses and tax credits.

Professional advice is  taken on the assessment of litigation and similar obligations. - Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters typically require a  higher degree of judgement than other types of provisions. When matters  are at an early stage, accounting judgements can be difficult because of the  high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present  obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows  that may arise. As matters progress, management and legal advisers  evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised,  revising previous estimates as appropriate. At more advanced stages, it is | - Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters remain very  sensitive to the assumptions used in the estimate. There could be a  wider range of possible outcomes for any pending legal proceedings,  investigations or inquiries. As a result it is often not practicable to  quantify a range of possible outcomes for individual matters. It is also  not practicable to meaningfully quantify ranges of potential outcomes  in aggregate for these types of provisions because of the diverse  nature and circumstances of such matters and the wide range of  uncertainties involved. |\n\n## Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security, and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nLiabilities under financial guarantee contracts that are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable.\n\n## (n) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nSoftware under development is tested for impairment at least annually. Other non-financial assets are property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets. They are tested for impairment at the individual asset level when there is indication of impairment at that level, or at the CGU level for assets that do not have a recoverable amount at the individual asset level. In addition, impairment is also tested at the CGU level when there is indication of impairment at that level. For this purpose, CGUs are considered to be the principal operating legal entities divided by global business.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\nImpairment testing compares the carrying amount of the non-financial asset or CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. The carrying amount of a CGU comprises the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities, including non-financial assets that are directly attributable to it and non-financial assets that can be allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis. Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are tested for impairment at an appropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU, which is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based on appropriate inputs (see Note 21).\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the higher of their respective individual recoverable amount or nil. Impairment is not allocated to the financial assets in a CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in prior periods for non-financial assets are reversed when there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets would not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.\n\n## Critical estimates and judgements\n\nThe review of goodwill and other non-financial assets for impairment reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as described in the 'Critical estimates and judgements' in Note 1.2(a).\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill and non-financial assets in the next financial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental.\n\n## (o) Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nHSBC classifies non-current assets or disposal groups (including assets and liabilities) as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. To be classified as held for sale, the non-current asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), and the sale must be highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group) and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated. Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. In addition, the sale should be expected to qualify as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nHeld for sale assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except for those assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5. If the carrying amount of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is greater than the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell is recognised. Any such impairment loss is first allocated against the non-current assets that are in scope of IFRS 5 for measurement. This first reduces the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the disposal group, and then to the other non-current assets of the disposal group pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the disposal group. Thereafter, any impairment loss in excess of the carrying amount of the non-current assets in scope of IFRS 5 for measurement is recognised against the total assets of the disposal group.\n\n## Critical judgements\n\nThe classification as held for sale depends on certain judgements:\n\n## Judgements\n\nManagement judgement is required in determining whether the IFRS 5 held for sale criteria are met, including whether a sale is highly probable and expected to complete within one year of classification. The exercise of judgement will normally consider the likelihood of successfully securing any necessary regulatory or governmental approvals, which are almost always required for sales of banking businesses, and sanctions risk. For large and complex plans, judgement will also include an assessment of the enforceability of any binding sale agreement, the nature and magnitude of any disincentives for non-performance, and the ability of the counterparty to undertake necessary pre-completion preparatory work, comply with conditions precedent, and otherwise be able to comply with contractual undertakings to achieve completion within the expected timescale. Once classified as held for sale, judgement is required to be applied on a continuous basis to ensure that classification remains appropriate in future accounting periods.\n\n## (p) Hyperinflationary accounting\n\nHyperinflationary accounting is applied to those subsidiary operations in countries where the three-year cumulative inflation rate is approaching or exceeding 100%. In 2023, this affected the Group's operations in Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. The Group applies IAS 29 to the underlying financial information of relevant subsidiaries to restate their local currency results and financial position so as to be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Those restated results are translated into the Group's presentation currency of US dollars for consolidation at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. Group comparatives are not restated for inflation and consequential adjustments to the opening balance sheet in relation to hyperinflationary subsidiaries are presented in other comprehensive income. The hyperinflationary gain or loss in respect of the net monetary position of the relevant subsidiary is included in profit or loss.\n\nWhen applying hyperinflation accounting for the first time, the underlying financial information is restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period as if the relevant economy had always been hyperinflationary. Group comparatives are not restated for such historical adjustments.",

        "page_content": "## Post-employment benefit plans\n\nThe Group operates pension plans throughout the world for its employees. 'Pension risk management processes' on page 206 contains details of the policies and practices associated with these pension plans, some of which are defined benefit plans. The largest defined benefit plan is the HBUK section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme ('the principal plan'), created as a result of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme being fully sectionalised in 2018 to meet the requirements of the Banking Reform Act. For further details of how the trustee of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme manages climate risk, see 'Managing climate risk' on page 65.\n\nHSBC holds on its balance sheet the net surplus or deficit, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date for each plan. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through potential future refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, HSBC has considered its current right to obtain a future refund or a reduction in future contributions together with the rights of third parties such as trustees.\n\n## The principal plan\n\nThe principal plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to future benefit accrual in 2015, with defined benefits earned by employees at that date continuing to be linked to their salary while they remain employed by HSBC. The plan is overseen by an independent corporate trustee, who has a fiduciary responsibility for the operation of the plan. Its assets are held separately from the assets of the Group.\n\nThe investment strategy of the plan is to hold the majority of assets in bonds, with the remainder in a diverse range of investments. It also includes some interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk, inflation swaps to reduce inflation risk and longevity swaps to reduce the impact of longer life expectancy.\n\nThe principal plan is subject to the statutory funding objective requirements of the UK Pensions Act 2004, which requires that it be funded to at least the level of technical provisions (an actuarial estimate of the assets needed to provide for the benefits already built up under the plan). Where a funding valuation is carried out and identifies a deficit, the employer and trustee are required to agree to a deficit recovery plan.\n\nThe latest funding valuation of the plan at 31 December 2019 was carried out by Colin G Singer of Willis Towers Watson Limited, who is a Fellow of the UK Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. At that date, the market value of the plan's assets was \u00a331.1bn ($41.1bn) and this exceeded the value placed on its liabilities on an ongoing basis by \u00a32.5bn ($3.3bn), giving a funding level of 109%. These figures include defined contribution assets amounting to \u00a32.4bn ($3.2bn). The main differences between the assumptions used for assessing the defined benefit liabilities for this funding valuation and those used for IAS 19 are that an element of prudence is contained in the funding valuation assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate and life expectancy. The funding valuation is used to judge the amount of cash contributions the Group needs to put into the pension scheme. It will always be different to the IAS 19 accounting surplus, which is an accounting rule concerning employee benefits and shown on the balance sheet of our financial statements. The next funding valuation, with an effective date of 31 December 2022, is currently underway and will be concluded no later than the regulatory deadline of 31 March 2024. The plan is estimated to remain in a comfortable surplus relative to the funding liabilities as at the end of 2022, based on assumptions consistent with those used to determine the funding liabilities for the 2019 valuation.\n\nThe actuary also assessed the value of the liabilities if the plan were to have been stopped and an insurance company asked to secure all future pension payments. This is generally larger than the amount needed on the ongoing basis described above because an insurance company would use more prudent assumption, which would allow for reserves and include an explicit allowance for the future administrative expenses of the plan. Under this approach, the amount of assets needed was estimated to be \u00a333bn ($44bn) at 31 December 2019.\n\nThe trust deed gives the ability for HSBC UK to take a refund of surplus assets after the plan has been run down such that no further beneficiaries remain. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, HSBC UK has considered its right to obtain a future refund together with the rights of third parties such as trustees. On this basis, any net surplus in the HBUK section of the plan is recognised in HSBC UK's financial statements and the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Income statement charge/(credit)\n\n|                                                   | 2023 $m   |   2022 $m | 2021 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Defined benefit pension plans                     | (151)     |        42 | 243       |\n| Defined contribution pension plans                | 874       |       845 | 767       |\n| Pension plans                                     | 723       |       887 | 1,010     |\n| Defined benefit and contribution healthcare plans | 34        |        28 | 27        |\n| Year ended 31 Dec                                 | 757       |       915 | 1,037     |\n\nNet assets/(liabilities) recognised on the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans\n\n|                                                                                                        | Fair value of plan assets $m   | Present value of defined benefit obligations $m   | Effect of limit on plan  surpluses $m   | Total $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|\n| Defined benefit pension plans                                                                          | 33,897                         | (27,011)                                          | -                                       | 6,886      |\n| Defined benefit healthcare plans                                                                       | 107                            | (403)                                             | -                                       | (296)      |\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                                                                         | 34,004                         | (27,414)                                          | -                                       | 6,590      |\n| Total employee benefit liabilities (within Note 27 'Accruals, deferred  income and other liabilities') |                                |                                                   |                                         | (1,160)    |\n| Total employee benefit assets (within Note 22 'Prepayments,  accrued income and other assets')         |                                |                                                   |                                         | 7,750      |\n| Defined benefit pension plans                                                                          | 32,171                         | (25,693)                                          | -                                       | 6,478      |\n| Defined benefit healthcare plans                                                                       | 96                             | (388)                                             | -                                       | (292)      |\n| At 31 Dec 2022                                                                                         | 32,267                         | (26,081)                                          | -                                       | 6,186      |\n| Total employee benefit liabilities (within Note 27 'Accruals, deferred  income and other liabilities') |                                |                                                   |                                         | (1,096)    |\n| Total employee benefit assets (within Note 22 'Prepayments,  accrued income and other assets')         |                                |                                                   |                                         | 7,282      |",

The average number of persons employed during 2023 was 29 (2022: 42). A small number of employees are members of defined benefit pension plans. These employees are members of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. HSBC Holdings pays contributions to such plan for its own employees in accordance with the schedules of contributions determined by the trustees of the plan and recognises these contributions as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nNet asset/(liability) under defined benefit pension plans\n\n|                                                                          | Fair value of plan  assets   | Fair value of plan  assets   | Present value of  defined benefit  obligations   | Present value of  defined benefit  obligations   | Effect of the asset  ceiling 1   | Effect of the asset  ceiling 1   | Net defined benefit  asset/(liability) 1   | Net defined benefit  asset/(liability) 1   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                          | Principal 1 plan             | Other plans                  | Principal 1 plan                                 | Other plans                                      | Principal plan                   | Other plans                      | Principal plan                             | Other plans                                |\n|                                                                          | $m                           | $m                           | $m                                               | $m                                               | $m                               | $m                               | $m                                         | $m                                         |\n| At 1 Jan 2023                                                            | 25,121                       | 7,050                        | (18,787)                                         | (6,906)                                          | -

The key applicable tax rates for 2023 include Hong Kong (16.5%), the US (21%) and the UK (23.5%). If the Group's profits were taxed at the statutory rates of the countries in which the profits arose, then the tax rate for the year would have been 22.6% (2022: 23.3%).\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year of 19.1% was higher than in the previous year (2022: 4.7%). The effective tax rate for the year was increased by 2.3% by the non-taxable impairment of the Group's interest in BoCom, reduced by 1.6% by the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions and reduced by 1.5% by the non-taxable accounting gain on the acquisition of SVB UK. The effective tax rate for 2022 was reduced by 14.7% as a result of the recognition of previously unrecognised losses in the UK of $2.2bn and France of $0.3bn, in light of improved forecast profitability.\n\nOn 20 June 2023, legislation was substantively enacted in the UK to introduce the 'Pillar Two' global minimum tax model rules of the OECD's Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') and a UK qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, with effect from 1 January 2024. Under these rules, a top-up tax liability arises where the effective tax rate of the Group's operations in a jurisdiction, calculated using principles set out in the Pillar Two legislation, is below 15%. Any resulting tax is payable by HSBC Holdings plc, being the Group's ultimate parent, to HMRC. In response to the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax rules, many national governments have announced their intention to introduce domestic minimum tax rules that are closely aligned to the OECD's Pillar Two model rules. Where such qualifying domestic minimum tax rules are introduced, they may be expected to have the effect of increasing local tax liabilities to the 15% minimum rate, eliminating the top-up tax liability payable in the UK by HSBC Holdings plc in such cases. Based on the Group's forecasts, top-up tax liabilities are expected to arise in approximately 10 jurisdictions as a result of low or 0% statutory tax rates, in particular in respect of the Group's banking operations in Bermuda and the Channel Islands. Additionally, the application of local tax laws in Hong Kong and mainland China, particularly with regard to the non-taxation of dividend income and income on government bonds, has typically resulted in effective tax rates of below 15%. This is expected to create future top-up tax liabilities in these jurisdictions, which have statutory tax rates of 16.5% and 25%, respectively. The application of the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules and the introduction of new domestic minimum tax regimes are currently forecast to increase the Group's annual effective tax rate by around 0.5 and 1.0 percentage points.\n\nAccounting for taxes involves some estimation because tax law is uncertain and its application requires a degree of judgement, which authorities may dispute. Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account external advice where appropriate. Exposures relating to legacy tax cases were reassessed during 2023, resulting in a credit of $472m to the income statement. We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided. HSBC only recognises current and deferred tax assets where recovery is probable.",

Management's assessment of the likely availability of future taxable profits against which to recover deferred tax assets is based on the most recent financial forecasts approved by management, which cover a five-year period and are extrapolated where necessary, and takes into consideration the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and past business performance. When forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years, a number of different scenarios are considered, reflecting different downward risk adjustments, in order to assess the sensitivity of our recognition and measurement conclusions in the context of such longer-term forecasts.\n\nThe Group's net deferred tax asset of $6.5bn (2022: $7.4bn) included $3.3bn (2022: $4.0bn) of deferred tax assets relating to the UK, $3.1bn (2022: $3.3bn) of deferred tax assets relating to the US and a net deferred asset of $0.9bn (2022: $1.0bn) in France.\n\nThe UK deferred tax asset of $3.3bn excluded a $1.9bn deferred tax liability arising on the UK pension scheme surplus, the reversal of which is not taken into account when estimating future taxable profits. The UK deferred tax assets are supported by forecasts of taxable profit, also taking into consideration the history of profitability in the relevant businesses. The majority of the deferred tax asset relates to tax attributes which do not expire and are forecast to be recovered within four years and as such are less sensitive to changes in long-term profit forecasts.\n\nThe net US deferred tax asset of $3.1bn included $1.3bn related to US tax losses, of which $1.0bn expire in 10 to 15 years. Management expects the US deferred tax asset to be substantially recovered within 14 years, with the majority recovered in the first nine years.\n\nThe net deferred tax asset in France of $0.9bn included $0.7bn related to tax losses, which are expected to be substantially recovered within 12 years.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\nThe amount of gross temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet was $10.4bn (2022: $9.2bn). This amount included unused US state tax losses of $4.0bn (2022: $4.1bn) which are forecast to expire before they are recovered and unused UK tax losses of $4.5bn (2022: $3.5bn), which arose prior to 1 April 2017 and can only be recovered against future taxable profits of HSBC Holdings. No deferred tax was recognised on these losses due to the absence of convincing evidence regarding the availability of sufficient future taxable profits against which to recover them. Deferred tax asset recognition is reassessed at each balance sheet date based on the available evidence. Of the total amounts unrecognised, $5.1bn (2022: $3.6bn) had no expiry date, $0.5bn (2022: $1.2bn) was scheduled to expire within 10 years and the remaining balance is expected to expire after 10 years.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group's investments in subsidiaries and branches where HSBC is able to control the timing of remittance or other realisation and where remittance or realisation is not probable in the foreseeable future. The aggregate temporary differences relating to unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on investments in subsidiaries and branches was $14.4bn (2022: $11.7bn) and the corresponding unrecognised deferred tax liability was $0.7bn (2022: $0.7bn).",

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n\n## Basic and diluted earnings per share\n\n|                                               | 2023      | 2023                         | 2023         | 2022\u00b9     | 2022\u00b9                       | 2022\u00b9       | 2021      | 2021                        | 2021        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------|\n|                                               | Profit $m | Number  of shares (millions) | Per  share $ | Profit $m | Number of shares (millions) | Per share $ | Profit $m | Number of shares (millions) | Per share $ |\n| Basic 2                                       | 22,432    | 19,478                       | 1.15         | 14,346    | 19,849                      | 0.72        | 12,607    | 20,197                      | 0.62        |\n| Effect of dilutive potential  ordinary shares |           | 122                          |              |           | 137                         |             |           | 105                         |             |\n| Diluted 2                                     | 22,432    | 19,600                       | 1.14         | 14,346    | 19,986                      | 0.72        | 12,607    | 20,302                      | 0.62        |\n\nThe number of anti-dilutive employee share options excluded from the weighted average number of dilutive potential ordinary shares was 23 million (2022: 9.4 million; 2021: 8.6 million).\n\n## 10 Segmental analysis\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, supported by the rest of the Group Executive Committee ('GEC'), is considered the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') for the purposes of identifying the Group's reportable segments. Global business results are assessed by the CODM on the basis of constant currency performance that removes the effects of currency translation from reported results. Therefore, we disclose these results on a constant currency basis as required by IFRS Accounting Standards. The 2022 and 2021 income statements are converted at the average rates of exchange for 2023, and the balance sheets at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 at the prevailing rates of exchange on 31 December 2023.\n\nOur operations are closely integrated and, accordingly, the presentation of data includes internal allocations of certain items of income and expense. These allocations include the costs of certain support services and global functions to the extent that they can be meaningfully attributed to global businesses. While such allocations have been made on a systematic and consistent basis, they necessarily involve a degree of subjectivity. Costs that are not allocated to global businesses are included in Corporate Centre.\n\nWhere relevant, income and expense amounts presented include the results of inter-segment funding along with inter-company and interbusiness line transactions. All such transactions are undertaken on arm's length terms. Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of actual recharges. The intra-Group elimination items for the global businesses are presented in Corporate Centre.\n\n## Resegmentation\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, following an internal review to assess which global businesses were best suited to serve our customers' respective needs, a portfolio of our Global Banking customers within our entities in Latin America was transferred from Global Banking and Markets to Commercial Banking for reporting purposes. Comparative data have been re-presented accordingly. Similar smaller transfers from Global Banking and Markets to Commercial Banking were also undertaken within our entities in Australia and Indonesia, where comparative data have not been re-presented.\n\n## Our global businesses\n\nWe provide a comprehensive range of banking and related financial services to our customers in our three global businesses. The products and services offered to customers are organised by these global businesses.\n\n- -Wealth and Personal Banking ('WPB') provides a full range of retail banking and wealth products to our customers from personal banking to ultra high net worth individuals.

For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument comparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.\n\nFor fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support functions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.\n\nChanges in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories including portfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments.\n\nThe majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GBM. GBM's fair value governance structure comprises its Finance function, Valuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing valuation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation Committees, which consist of independent support functions. These committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review Group, which considers all material subjective valuations.",

When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are either based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread that is appropriate to HSBC's liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group's own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using an appropriate market discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable to the Group's own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all securities.\n\nStructured notes issued and certain other hybrid instruments are reported as financial liabilities designated at fair value. The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC, recorded in other comprehensive income, reverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\n- -Level 1 - valuation technique using quoted market price. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.\n- -Level 2 - valuation technique using observable inputs. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.\n- -Level 3 - valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs. These are financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value and bases of valuation\n\n|                                                                                                      | 2023       | 2023       | 2023       | 2023     | 2022 1     | 2022 1     | 2022 1     | 2022 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                                                                                      | Level 1 $m | Level 2 $m | Level 3 $m | Total $m | Level 1 $m | Level 2 $m | Level 3 $m | Total $m |\n| Recurring fair value measurements at 31 Dec                                                          |            |            |            |          |            |            |            |          |\n| Assets                                                                                               |            |            |            |          |            |            |            |          |\n| Trading assets                                                                                       | 202,020    | 82,833     | 4,306      | 289,159  | 148,592    | 64,684     | 4,817      | 218,093  |\n| Financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily  measured at fair value through profit or loss | 27,030     | 63,825     | 19,788     | 110,643  | 23,146     | 59,548     | 17,407     | 100,101  |\n| Derivatives                                                                                          | 931        | 226,714    | 2,069      | 229,714  | 2,917      | 279,278    | 1,964      | 284,159  |\n| Financial investments                                                                                | 215,228    | 76,591     | 2,618      | 294,437  | 181,659    | 71,040     | 2,961      | 255,660  |\n| Liabilities                                                                                          |            |            |            |          |            |            |            |          |\n| Trading liabilities                                                                                  | 53,354     | 19,318     | 478        | 73,150   | 44,787     | 27,092     | 474        | 72,353   |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value                                                       | 1,266      | 129,232    | 10,928     | 141,426  | 1,125      | 115,764    | 10,432     | 127,321  |\n| Derivatives                                                                                          | 1,918      | 230,285    | 2,569      | 234,772  | 2,399      | 280,443    | 2,920      | 285,762  |\n\nThe table below provides the fair value levelling of assets held for sale and liabilities of disposal groups that have been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.

Transfers into and out of levels of the fair value hierarchy are primarily attributable to observability of valuation inputs and price transparency.\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWe adopt the use of fair value adjustments when we take into consideration additional factors not incorporated within the valuation model that would otherwise be considered by a market participant. We classify fair value adjustments as either 'risk-related' or 'model-related'. The majority of these adjustments relate to GBM. Movements in the amount of fair value adjustments do not necessarily translate in equivalent movements of profits or losses within the income statement, as these movements can be compensated by other related profits or loss effects. For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required. Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but this may not result in profit or loss.\n\nGlobal Banking and Markets fair value adjustments\n\n|                                       | 2023   | 2023                | 2022   | 2022                |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|---------------------|--------|---------------------|\n|                                       | GBM $m | Corporate Centre $m | GBM $m | Corporate Centre $m |\n| Type of adjustment                    |        |                     |        |                     |\n| Risk-related                          | 692    | 41                  | 650    | 40                  |\n| -  bid-offer                          | 414    | -                   | 426    | -                   |\n| -  uncertainty                        | 75     | 3                   | 86     | -                   |\n| -  credit valuation adjustment        | 164    | 35                  | 245    | 35                  |\n| -  debit valuation adjustment         | (54)   | -                   | (175)  | -                   |\n| -  funding fair value adjustment      | 93     | 3                   | 68     | 5                   |\n| Model-related                         | 63     | -                   | 61     | -                   |\n| -  model limitation                   | 63     | -                   | 61     | -                   |\n| Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) | 86     | -                   | 97     | -                   |\n| At 31 Dec                             | 841    | 41                  | 808    | 40                  |\n\nThe increase in fair value adjustments was predominantly driven by the reduction in the debit valuation adjustment including a consideration of the overlap with the funding fair value adjustment. This was partly offset by reductions from changes to exposure, and tightening of credit and liquidity market spreads.\n\n## Bid-offer\n\nIFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the position.\n\n## Uncertainty\n\nCertain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. In these circumstances, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that market participants would adopt more conservative values for uncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in HSBC's valuation model.\n\n## Credit and debit valuation adjustments\n\nThe credit valuation adjustment ('CVA') is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter ('OTC') derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that the counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions.\n\nThe debit valuation adjustment ('DVA') is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that HSBC may default, and that it may not pay the full market value of the transactions. The DVA considers the overlap with the funding fair value adjustment.\n\nHSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each legal entity, and for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure. With the exception of central clearing parties, all third-party counterparties are included in the CVA and DVA calculations, and these adjustments are not netted across Group entities.\n\nHSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default ('PD') of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, to HSBC's expected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Conversely, HSBC calculates the DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the expected positive exposure of the counterparty to HSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure.\n\nFor most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology, which incorporates a range of potential exposures over the life of the portfolio, to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants, such as counterparty netting agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\nThe methodologies do not, in general, account for 'wrong-way risk'. Wrong-way risk is an adverse correlation between the counterparty's probability of default and the mark-to-market value of the underlying transaction. The risk can either be general, perhaps related to the currency of the issuer country, or specific to the transaction concerned. When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is applied to reflect this risk in the valuation.\n\n## Funding fair value adjustment\n\nThe funding fair value adjustment ('FFVA') is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available, and is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure, such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty.\n\n## Model limitation\n\nModels used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplified set of assumptions that do not capture all current and future material market characteristics. In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted.\n\n## Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves)\n\nInception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs. The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed in Note 1.\n\n## Fair value valuation bases\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value using a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs -

Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain 'other derivatives' and predominantly all Level 3 asset-backed securities are legacy positions. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions.\n\n## Private equity including strategic investments\n\nThe fair value of a private equity investment (including strategic investments) is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee's financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market; the price at which similar companies have changed ownership; or from published net asset values ('NAV') received. If necessary, adjustments are made to the NAV of funds to obtain the best estimate of fair value.\n\n## Asset-backed securities\n\nWhile quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of the asset-backed securities ('ABSs'), valuation models are used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are required. For certain ABSs, such as residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model with assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate. The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature.\n\n## Structured notes\n\nThe fair value of Level 3 structured notes is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. These structured notes comprise principally equity-linked notes issued by HSBC, which provide the counterparty with a return linked to the performance of equity securities and other portfolios.\n\nExamples of the unobservable parameters include long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nOTC derivative valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon 'no arbitrage' principles. For many vanilla derivative products, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources.",

        "page_content": "## Private equity including strategic investments\n\nGiven the bespoke nature of the analysis in respect of each private equity holding, it is not practical to quote a range of key unobservable inputs. The valuation approach includes using a range of inputs that include company-specific financials, traded comparable companies multiples, published net asset values and qualitative assumptions, which are not directly comparable or quantifiable.\n\n## Prepayment rates\n\nPrepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. They vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a variety of evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and macroeconomic modelling.\n\n## Market proxy\n\nMarket proxy pricing may be used for an instrument when specific market pricing is not available but there is evidence from instruments with common characteristics. In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally evidence across a wider range of instruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the manner of that influence.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price. It varies by underlying reference market price, and by strike and maturity of the option. Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable and are estimated from observable data. The range of unobservable volatilities reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market variables and is expressed as a number between minus one and one. It is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market variable. There is a wide range of instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-asset correlations is used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations. Unobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices, proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects the wide variation in correlation inputs by market variable pair.\n\n## Credit spread\n\nCredit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset. Credit spreads may be implied from market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.\n\n## Inter-relationships between key unobservable inputs\n\nKey unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other. As described above, market variables may be correlated. This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic or other events. Furthermore, the effect of changing market variables on the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBC's net risk position in respect of each variable.\n\n## HSBC Holdings\n\nBasis of valuing HSBC Holdings' financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\n|                                                                                       | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Valuation technique using observable inputs: Level 2                                  |           |           |\n| Assets at 31 Dec                                                                      |           |           |\n| -  derivatives                                                                        | 3,344     | 3,801     |\n| -  designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss | 59,879    | 52,322    |\n| Liabilities at 31 Dec                                                                 |           |           |\n| -  designated at fair value                                                           | 43,638    | 32,123    |\n| -  derivatives                                                                        | 6,090     | 6,922     |",

        "page_content": "## Valuation\n\nFair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This may be different from the theoretical economic value attributed from an instrument's cash flows over its expected future life. Our valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available may differ from those of other companies.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks and customers\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. Fair values are based on observable market transactions, when available. When they are unavailable, fair values are estimated using valuation models incorporating a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include: value estimates from third-party brokers reflecting overthe-counter trading activity; forward-looking discounted cash flow models, taking account of expected customer prepayment rates, using assumptions that HSBC believes are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such loans; recent origination pricing for similar loans; and trading inputs from other market participants including observed primary and secondary trades. From time to time, we may engage a third-party valuation specialist to measure the fair value of a pool of loans.\n\nThe fair value of loans reflects expected credit losses at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants' expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date. For credit-impaired loans, fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows over the time period they are expected to be recovered.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nThe fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that incorporate the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.\n\n## Deposits by banks and customer accounts\n\nThe fair values of on-demand deposits are approximated by their carrying amount. For deposits with longer-term maturities, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\n\n## Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities\n\nFair values in debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements - non-trading\n\nFair values of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are held on a non-trading basis provide approximate carrying amounts. This is due to the fact that balances are generally short dated.\n\n## HSBC Holdings\n\nThe methods used by HSBC Holdings to determine fair values of financial instruments for the purposes of measurement and disclosure are described above.\n\nFair values of HSBC Holdings' financial instruments not carried at fair value on the balance sheet\n\n|                                           | 2023               | 2023            | 2022               | 2022            |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n|                                           | Carrying amount $m | Fair value 1 $m | Carrying amount $m | Fair value 1 $m |\n| Assets at 31 Dec                          |                    |                 |                    |                 |\n| Loans and advances to HSBC undertakings   | 27,354             | 27,878          | 26,765             | 26,962          |\n| Financial investments - at amortised cost | 19,558             | 19,531          | 19,466             | 19,314          |\n| Liabilities at 31 Dec                     |                    |                 |                    |                 |\n| Debt securities in issue                  | 65,239             | 65,172          | 66,938             | 65,364          |\n| Subordinated liabilities                  | 24,439             | 26,651          | 19,727             | 20,644          |\n\n## 14 Financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                                           | 2023                         | 2023                                    | 2023     | 2022\u00b9                        | 2022\u00b9                                   | 2022\u00b9    |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                           | Designated at  fair value $m | Mandatorily  measured at  fair value $m | Total $m | Designated at  fair value $m | Mandatorily  measured at  fair value $m | Total $m |\n| Securities                                | 2,353                        | 101,152                                 | 103,505  | 3,096                        | 91,936                                  | 95,032   |\n| -  treasury and other eligible bills      | 695                          | 724                                     | 1,419    | 649                          | 869                                     | 1,518    |\n| -  debt securities                        | 1,658                        | 60,045                                  | 61,703   | 2,447                        | 56,633                                  | 59,080   |\n| -  equity securities                      | -                            | 40,383                                  | 40,383   | -                            | 34,434                                  | 34,434   |\n| Loans and advances to banks and customers | 371                          | 5,495                                   | 5,866    | -                            | 3,455                                   | 3,455    |\n| Other                                     | -                            | 1,272                                   | 1,272    | -                            | 1,614                                   | 1,614    |\n| At 31 Dec                                 | 2,724                        | 107,919                                 | 110,643  | 3,096                        | 97,005                                  | 100,101  |",

Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities include market-making and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenue based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives.\n\nSubstantially all of HSBC Holdings' derivatives entered into with subsidiaries are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities.",

Further details of how these risks arise and how they are managed by the Group can be found in the 'Risk review'.\n\n## Hedged risk components\n\nHSBC designates a portion of cash flows of a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments for a specific interest rate or foreign currency risk component in a fair value or cash flow hedge. The designated risks and portions are either contractually specified or otherwise separately identifiable components of the financial instrument that are reliably measurable. Risk-free or benchmark interest rates generally are regarded as being both separately identifiable and reliably measurable, except for the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 transition where HSBC designates alternative benchmark rates as the hedged risk which may not have been separately identifiable upon initial designation, provided HSBC reasonably expects it will meet the requirement within 24 months from the first designation date. The designated risk components account for a significant portion of the overall changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nHSBC uses net investment hedges to hedge the structural foreign exchange risk related to net investments in foreign operations including subsidiaries and branches whose functional currencies are different from that of the parent. When hedging with foreign exchange forward contracts, the spot rate component of the foreign exchange risk is designated for an amount of net assets as the hedged risk.\n\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk, including but not limited to the discount rates used for calculating the fair value of derivatives, hedges using instruments with a non-zero fair value, and notional and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nHSBC enters into fixed-for-floating-interest-rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in fair value caused by movements in market interest rates on certain fixed-rate financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, including debt securities held and issued.\n\n## HSBC hedging instrument by hedged risk\n\n|                 | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument     |\n|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n|                 | Carrying amount      | Carrying amount      | Carrying amount      | Carrying amount      |                        |\n|                 | Notional amount 1    | Assets               | Liabilities          | Balance sheet        | Change in fair value 2 |\n| Hedged risk     | $m                   | $m                   | $m                   | presentation         | $m                     |\n| Interest rate 3 | 172,985              | 3,729                | 2,965                | Derivatives          | (1,043)                |\n| At 31 Dec 2023  | 172,985              | 3,729                | 2,965                |                      | (1,043)                |\n| Interest rate 3 | 162,062              | 4,973                | 2,573                | Derivatives          | 4,064                  |\n| At 31 Dec 2022  | 162,062              | 4,973                | 2,573                |                      | 4,064                  |\n\n## HSBC hedged item by hedged risk\n\n|                 | Hedged item     | Hedged item     | Hedged item                                                               | Hedged item                                                               | Hedged item                                                                                                    | Ineffectiveness   | Ineffectiveness       | Ineffectiveness                                                                                |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | Carrying amount | Carrying amount | Accumulated fair value  hedge adjustments  included in carrying  amount 1 | Accumulated fair value  hedge adjustments  included in carrying  amount 1 | Accumulated fair value  hedge adjustments  included in carrying  amount 1                                      | Change in  2      | Recognised  in profit |                                                                                                |\n|                 | Assets          | Liabilities     | Assets                                                                    | Liabilities                                                               | Balance sheet                                                                                                  | fair value        | and loss              | Profit and loss                                                                                |\n| Hedged risk     | $m              | $m              | $m                                                                        | $m                                                                        | presentation                                                                                                   | $m                | $m                    | presentation                                                                                   |\n| Interest rate 3 | 82,321          |                 | (2,282)                                                                   |                                                                           | Financial investments -

        "page_content": "## Cash flow hedges\n\nHSBC's cash flow hedging instruments consist principally of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps that are used to manage the variability in future interest cash flows of non-trading financial assets and liabilities, arising due to changes in market interest rates and foreigncurrency basis.\n\nHSBC applies macro cash flow hedging for interest rate risk exposures on portfolios of replenishing current and forecasted issuances of nontrading assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates, including rolling such instruments. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate cash flows representing both principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios are used to determine the effectiveness and ineffectiveness. Macro cash flow hedges are considered to be dynamic hedges.\n\nHSBC also hedges the variability in future cash flows on foreign-denominated financial assets and liabilities arising due to changes in foreign exchange market rates with cross-currency swaps, which are considered dynamic hedges.\n\n## Hedging instrument by hedged risk\n\n|                  | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument           |                       |                       | Ineffectiveness                     | Ineffectiveness                                                                |\n|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Carrying amount 1    | Assets $m            | Liabilities          |                              | Change in  fair value | Change in fair  value |                                     | Profit and loss  presentation                                                  |\n| Hedged risk      | Notional  amount $m  |                      | $m                   | Balance  sheet  presentation | 2 $m                  | 3 $m                  | Recognised  in profit and  loss  $m |                                                                                |\n| Foreign currency | 29,772               | 935                  | 257                  | Derivatives                  | 977                   | 977                   | -

Hedging could be undertaken for Group structural exposure to changes in the US dollar to foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing with foreign currency borrowings. An economic relationship exists between the hedged net investment and hedging instrument due to the shared foreign currency risk exposure.

The hedge accounting relationships that are affected by Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments are presented in the balance sheet as 'Financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through other comprehensive income', 'Loans and advances to customers', 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Deposits by banks'. The notional value of the derivatives impacted by the Ibor reform, including those designated in hedge accounting relationships, is disclosed in Note 32. For further details of Ibor transition, see 'Ibor transition' on page 139.\n\nFor some of the Ibors included under the 'Other' header in the table below, judgement has been needed to establish whether a transition is required, since there are Ibor benchmarks that are subject to computation methodology improvements and insertion of fallback provisions without full clarity being provided by their administrators on whether these Ibor benchmarks will be demised.\n\nThe notional amounts of interest rate derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships do not represent the extent of the risk exposure managed by the Group but they are expected to be directly affected by market-wide Ibor reform and in scope of Phase 1 amendments and are shown in the table below. The cross-currency swaps designated in hedge accounting relationships and affected by Ibor reform are not significant and have not been presented below.\n\n## Hedging instrument impacted by Ibor reform\n\n|                   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument    | Hedging instrument   |\n|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n|                   |                      |                      | Impacted by Ibor reform |                      |                      | Not impacted  by Ibor |                      |\n|                   | \u20ac 1                  | \u00a3                    | $                       | Other 2              | Total                | reform                | Notional amount 3    |\n|                   | $m                   | $m                   | $m                      | $m                   | $m                   | $m                    | $m                   |\n| Fair value hedges | 16,907               | -                    | -                       | 4,384                | 21,291               | 151,694               | 172,985              |\n| Cash flow hedges  | 10,850               | -                    | -                       | 3,504                | 14,354               | 173,973               | 188,327              |\n| At 31 Dec 2023    | 27,757               | -                    | -                       | 7,888                | 35,645               | 325,667               | 361,312              |\n| Fair value hedges | 12,756               | -                    | 2,015                   | 12,643               | 27,414               | 134,648               | 162,062              |\n| Cash flow hedges  | 8,865                | -                    | -                       | 27,830               | 36,695               | 77,832                | 114,527              |\n| At 31 Dec 2022    | 21,621               | -                    | 2,015                   | 40,473               | 64,109               | 212,480               | 276,589              |\n\n- 1 The notional contract amounts of euro interest rate derivatives impacted by Ibor reform consist of hedges with a Euribor benchmark.\n- 2 Other benchmarks impacted by Ibor reform consist mainly of Emirates interbank offered rate, Mexican interbank equilibrium interest rate ('TIIE') and Korean won-related derivatives. In 2022, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate ('HIBOR') was included in 'Other' given that reform in the benchmark was considered possible. At 31 December 2023, HIBOR was no longer expected to be directly affected by Ibor reform following the successful transition of all Libor settings and the HKMA's affirmation that there are no plans to discontinue HIBOR. As a result HIBOR has been moved from 'Other' to 'Not impacted by Ibor reform'.\n- 3 The notional contract amounts of interest rate derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date and they do not represent amounts at risk.",

        "page_content": "## Bank of Communications Co., Limited\n\nWe maintain a 19.03% interest in Bank of Communications Co., Limited ('BoCom'). The Group's investment in BoCom is classified as an associate. Significant influence in BoCom was established with consideration of all relevant factors, including representation on BoCom's Board of Directors and participation in a resource and experience sharing agreement ('RES'). Under the RES, HSBC staff have been seconded to assist in the maintenance of BoCom's financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of associate's net assets. An impairment test is required if there is any indication of impairment.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe fair value of the Group's investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 12 years. We have previously disclosed that the excess of the value in use ('VIU') calculation over its balance sheet value has been marginal in recent years, and that reasonably possible changes in assumptions could generate an impairment.\n\nRecent macroeconomic, policy and industry-wide factors resulted in a wider range of possible VIU calculation outcomes, and our VIU calculation uses both historical experience and market participant views to estimate future cash flows, relevant discount rates and associated capital assumptions. At 31 December 2023, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which resulted in an impairment of $3.0bn, as the recoverable amount as determined by a VIU calculation was lower than the carrying value.\n\n|       | At 31 Dec 2023   | At 31 Dec 2023   | At 31 Dec 2023   | At 31 Dec 2022   | At 31 Dec 2022   | At 31 Dec 2022   |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|       | VIU              | Carrying value   | Fair value       | VIU              | Carrying value   | Fair value       |\n|       | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              |\n| BoCom | 21.2             | 21.2             | 8.8              | 23.5             | 23.3             | 8.1              |\n\nThe impairment test will be updated in future periods, reflecting updated assumptions in the VIU impairment calculation. Going forward, the carrying value will be aligned to the updated VIU calculation and capped at carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised, rather than at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of associate's net assets, and therefore there is a risk of reversals or further impairments in future periods.\n\nThe VIU may increase or decrease depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. The main model inputs are described below and are based on factors observed at period-end. The factors that could result in increases or reductions in the VIU include changes in BoCom's shortterm performance, a change in regulatory capital requirements or revisions to the forecast of BoCom's future profitability.\n\nIf the Group did not have significant influence in BoCom, the investment would be carried at fair value rather than the current carrying value.\n\n## Basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying value. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management's best estimates of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the best estimate.\n\nThere are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management's best estimate of BoCom's earnings. Forecast earnings growth over the short to medium term is lower than recent (within the last five years) actual growth, and reflects the impact of recent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors in mainland China. As a result of management's intent to continue to retain its investment, earnings beyond the short to medium term are then extrapolated into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to derive a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the VIU. The second component is the capital maintenance charge ('CMC'), which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for BoCom to meet capital requirements over the forecast period, meaning that CMC is deducted when arriving at management's estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders. The CMC reflects the revised capital requirements arising from revisions of the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets assumption. The principal inputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets and the expected capital requirements. An increase in the CMC as a result of a change to these principal inputs would reduce VIU. Additionally, management considers other qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate.\n\n## Key assumptions in value in use calculation\n\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n- -Long-term profit growth rate: 3% (2022: 3%) for periods after 2027, which does not exceed forecast GDP growth in mainland China and is similar to forecasts by external analysts.\n- -Long-term asset growth rate: 3% (2022: 3%) for periods after 2027, which is the rate that assets are expected to grow to achieve long-term profit growth of 3%.\n- -Discount rate: 9.00% (2022: 10.04%), which is based on a capital asset pricing model ('CAPM'), using market data. The discount rate used is within the range of 7.9% to 9.7% (2022: 8.4% to 10.4%) indicated by the CAPM, and decreased as a consequence of a market-driven reduction in beta. While the CAPM range sits at the lower end of the range adopted by selected external analysts of 8.8% to 13.5% (2022: 8.8% to 13.5%), we continue to regard the CAPM range as the most appropriate basis for determining this assumption.\n- -Expected credit losses ('ECL') as a percentage of loans and advances to customers: ranges from 0.80% to 0.97% (2022: 0.99% to 1.05%) in the short to medium term, reflecting reported credit experience in mainland China. For periods after 2027, the ratio is 0.97% (2022: 0.97%), which is higher than BoCom's average ECL as a percentage of loans and advances to customers in recent years prior to the pandemic.\n- -Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: ranges from 62.0% to 63.7% (2022: 61.0% to 64.4%) in the short to medium term, reflecting higher risk-weights in the short term followed by an expected reversion to recent historical levels. For periods after 2027, the ratio is 62.0% (2022: 61.0%), which is similar to BoCom's actual results in recent years.\n- -Loans and advances to customers growth rate: ranges from 9.0% to 10.0% (2022: 7.1% to 11.0%) in the short to medium term, reflecting higher growth rate in loans and advances to customers as a result of recent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors in mainland China. Increases in the forecast growth rate of loans and advances to customers results in higher forecast ECL.",

These ratios are higher than BoCom's actual results in recent years and forecasts disclosed by external analysts.\n- -Effective tax rate ('ETR'): ranges from 5.3% to 15.0% (2022: 4.4% to 15.0%) in the short to medium term, reflecting BoCom's actual results and an expected increase towards the long-term assumption through the forecast period. For periods after 2027, the rate is 15.0% (2022: 15.0%), which is higher than the recent historical average, and aligned to the minimum tax rate as proposed by the OECD/Group of 20 ('G20') Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.\n- -Capital requirements: capital adequacy ratio of 12.5% (2022: 12.5%) and tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 9.5% (2022: 9.5%), based on BoCom's capital risk appetite and capital requirements respectively.\n\nThe following table further illustrates the impact on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions. This reflects the sensitivity of the VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change may occur at the same time. Loans and advances to customers growth rate has been added to the list of key assumptions detailed in the table to reflect the greater potential variability associated with the assumption as a result of recent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors in mainland China. The selected rates of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions are based on external analysts' forecasts, statutory requirements and other relevant external data sources, which can change period to period. Unless specified, favourable and unfavourable changes are consistently applied throughout short-to-medium and long-term forecast years, based on a straight-line average of the base case assumption.\n\n## Sensitivity of VIU to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions\n\n|                                                                            | Favourable change                 | Favourable change    | Unfavourable change   | Unfavourable change                 | Unfavourable change   | Unfavourable change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                            | bps                               | Increase in  VIU $bn | VIU $bn               | bps                                 | Decrease in  VIU $bn  | VIU $bn               |\n| At 31 Dec 2023                                                             |                                   |                      |                       |                                     |                       |                       |\n| Long-term profit growth rate 1                                             | 58                                | 3.3                  | 24.5                  | (79)                                | (3.4)                 | 17.8                  |\n| Long-term asset growth rate 1                                              | (79)                              | 4.5                  | 25.7                  | 58                                  | (4.0)                 | 17.2                  |\n| Discount rate                                                              | (110)                             | 4.5                  | 25.7                  | 280                                 | (6.1)                 | 15.1                  |\n| Expected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to customers  | 2023 to 2027: 78 2028 onwards: 91 | 2.9                  | 24.1                  | 2023 to 2027: 120 2028 onwards: 104 | (4.4)                 | 16.8                  |\n| Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets                       | (150)                             | 0.9                  | 22.1                  | 216                                 | (1.6)                 | 19.6                  |\n| Loans and advances to customers growth rate                                | (213)                             | 3.2                  | 24.4                  | 207                                 | (2.9)                 | 18.3                  |\n| Operating income growth rate                                               | 57                                | 2.6                  | 23.8                  | (81)                                | (2.6)                 | 18.6                  |\n| Cost-income ratio                                                          | (212)                             | 0.8                  | 22.0                  | 99                                  | (2.9)                 | 18.3                  |\n| Long-term effective tax rate                                               | (426)                             | 1.6                  | 22.8                  | 1,000                               | (3.5)                 | 17.7                  |\n| Capital requirements -

The possible range of VIU is based on impacts set out in the table above arising from the favourable/unfavourable change in the earnings in the short to medium term, the long-term expected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to customers, and a 50bps increase/decrease in the discount rate. All other long-term assumptions, and the basis of the CMC have been kept unchanged when determining the reasonably possible range of the VIU.\n\n## Selected financial information of BoCom\n\nThe statutory accounting reference date of BoCom is 31 December.

The principal countries and territories of operation are the same as the countries and territories of incorporation except for HSBC Life (International) Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities. Each bank is separately capitalised in accordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Group's risk appetite for the relevant country or region. HSBC's capital management process is incorporated in the financial resource plan, which is approved by the Board.\n\nHSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary. These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings' issuance of equity and non-equity capital, and by profit retention.\n\nAs part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its capital and its investment in subsidiaries. Subject to this, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings' ability to provide funding for such investments. During 2023, consistent with the Group's capital plan, the Group's material subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments from material subsidiaries. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.\n\nThe amount of guarantees by HSBC Holdings in favour of other Group entities is set out in Note 34.\n\nInformation on structured entities consolidated by HSBC where HSBC owns less than 50% of the voting rights is included in Note 20 'Structured entities'. In each of these cases, HSBC controls and consolidates an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\n## Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries\n\nAt each reporting period end, HSBC Holdings reviews investments in subsidiaries for indicators of impairment. An impairment is recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for that investment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the investment's fair value less costs of disposal and its VIU, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. The VIU is calculated by discounting management's cash flow projections for the investment. The cash flows represent the free cash flows based on the subsidiary's binding capital requirements.\n\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n- -Management's judgement in estimating future cash flows: The cash flow projections for each investment are based on the latest approved plans, which include forecast capital available for distribution based on the capital requirements of the subsidiary, taking into account minimum and core capital requirements. For the impairment test as at 31 December 2023, cash flow projections until the end of 2028 were considered in line with our internal planning horizon. Our cash flow projections include known and observable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model.\n- -Long-term growth rates: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the free cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective of the legal entity. The growth rate reflects long-term inflation for the country or territory within which the investment operates.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\n- -Discount rates: The rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each investment, which is derived using a CAPM and market implied cost of equity. CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market's assessment of the economic variables and management's judgement. The discount rates for each investment are refined to reflect the rates of inflation for the countries or territories within which the investment operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing investments for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, with cost of capital rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets. The impacts from climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable in discount rates and asset prices.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of HSBC Holdings' investments in subsidiaries was $159.5bn (2022: $167.5bn). The net year-onyear reduction was predominantly due to the recognition of a $5.5bn impairment of HSBC Holdings' investment in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited, resulting in a cumulative impairment of $10.2bn (2022: $4.7bn), and a carrying amount of $25.8bn as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $32.8bn).\n\nThe recoverable amount of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited is assessed as the aggregate of the recoverable amounts of its subsidiaries. During 2023, the principal subsidiaries of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited were HSBC North America Holdings Limited, HSBC Bank Canada and HSBC Bank Bermuda. In October 2023, HSBC Bank Bermuda was transferred to HSBC Bank plc. As at 31 December 2023, the adjusted net asset value of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited fell below the carrying amount therefore management assessed that indicators of impairment were present and an impairment test was performed. The recoverable amount reduced owing to lower projected profits and higher projected capital requirements for HSBC North America Holdings, the transfer of HSBC Bank Bermuda to HSBC Bank plc at its book value which stood below its assessed recoverable amount, and higher prevailing discount rates, as a result of which a $5.5bn impairment was recognised.\n\nAs HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited has entered into a sales purchase agreement with Royal Bank of Canada to dispose of our banking business in Canada, the sales purchase agreement has been used to support the recoverable amount of $11.0bn (2022: $10.8bn) (inclusive of the preferred shares) under a fair value less costs of disposal basis. The fair value less costs of disposal of HSBC Bank Canada is at a $3.7bn (2022: $3.7bn) premium to the book value recorded in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited. In 2024, a distribution of the proceeds from the planned sale of our banking business in Canada to HSBC Holdings from HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited could lead to a future impairment. In respect of distributable reserves, an impairment would be offset by the dividend income recognised on the distributions from sales proceeds.\n\n## Impairment test results\n\n| Investments                         | Recoverable  amount   | Discount  rate   | Long-term growth  rate   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| At 31 Dec 2023                      | $m                    | %                | %                        |\n| HSBC North America Holdings Limited | 12,756                | 10.50            | 2.17                     |\n| At 31 Dec 2022                      |                       |                  |                          |\n| HSBC North America Holdings Limited | 18,363                | 10.00            | 2.22                     |\n\n## Sensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the recoverable amount of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited remained sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions impacting its principal subsidiary, HSBC North America Holdings Limited.\n\nIn making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the model. These include the external range of observable discount rates, historical performance against forecast, and risks attached to the key assumptions underlying cash flow.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the key assumptions underlying the most sensitive inputs to the model for HSBC North America Holdings Limited, the key risks attached to each, and details of a reasonably possible change to assumptions where, in the opinion of management, these could result in a change in VIU.\n\n## Reasonably possible changes in key assumptions\n\n|                                                                                           | Input                       | Key assumptions                                                                                                                 | Associated risks                                                                                 | Reasonably possible  change                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment                                                                                |                             |                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                  |                                                                     |\n| HSBC North America Holdings  Limited (subsidiary of HSBC  Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited) | Free cash flows projections | - Level of interest rates  and yield curves. - Competitors' positions                                                           | - Strategic actions  relating to revenue  and costs are not  achieved.                           | - Free cash flow  projections decrease  by 10%.                     |\n|                                                                                           | Discount rate               | within the market. - Discount rate used is a  reasonable estimate of  a suitable market rate  for the profile of the  business. | - External evidence  arises to suggest that  the rate used is not  appropriate to the  business. | - Discount rate  decreases by 1%. - Discount rate  increases by 1%. |",

It is currently funded entirely by commercial paper ('CP') issued to HSBC. At 31 December 2023, HSBC held $1.3bn of CP (2022: $1.5bn).\n\n## Multi-seller conduit\n\nHSBC's multi-seller conduit was established to provide access to flexible market-based sources of finance for its clients. Currently, HSBC bears risk equal to the transaction-specific facility offered to the multi-seller conduit, amounting to $6.1bn at 31 December 2023 (2022: $6.2bn). First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide enhancement facilities.\n\n## Securitisations\n\nHSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances it originates in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.\n\n## HSBC managed funds\n\nHSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds. Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls these funds.\n\n## Other\n\nHSBC has entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business, which include asset and structured finance transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds.",

A review for indicators of impairment is undertaken at each subsequent quarter-end and at 31 December 2023. No indicators of impairment were identified as part of these reviews.\n\n## Basis of the recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its value in use ('VIU') at each respective testing date. The VIU is calculated by discounting management's cash flow projections for the CGU. The key assumptions used in the VIU calculation for each individually significant CGU that is not impaired are discussed below.\n\n## Key assumptions in VIU calculation - significant CGUs at 1 October 2023\n\n|                            | Carrying  amount at  1 Oct 2023 $m   | of which  goodwill $m   | Value in  use at  1 Oct 2023 $m   | Discount  rate %   | Growth  rate beyond  initial cash flow %   | Carrying  amount at  1 Oct 2022 $m   | of which  goodwill $m   | Value in  use at  1 Oct 2022 $m   | Discount rate %   | Growth  rate  beyond initial  cash flow  projections %   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| HSBC UK  Bank plc -  WPB 1 | 11,167                               | 2,597                   | 27,933                            | 10.4               | 2.0                                        | N/A                                  | N/A                     | N/A                               | N/A               | N/A                                                      |\n| Europe -  WPB 1            | N/A                                  | N/A                     | N/A                               | N/A                | N/A                                        | 15,215                               | 2,643                   | 46,596                            | 9.9               | 2.0                                                      |",

        "page_content": "At 1 October 2023, aggregate goodwill of $1,599m (1 October 2022: $1,464m) had been allocated to CGUs that were not considered individually significant. The Group's CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill.\n\n## Management's judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill in the next financial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental. The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on forecast profitability plans approved by the Board and minimum capital levels required to support the business operations of a CGU. The Board challenges and endorses planning assumptions in light of internal capital allocation decisions necessary to support our strategy, current market conditions and macroeconomic outlook. For the 1 October 2023 impairment test, cash flow projections until the end of 2028 were considered, in line with our internal planning horizon. Key assumptions underlying cash flow projections reflect management's outlook on interest rates and inflation, as well as business strategy, including the scale of investment in technology and automation. Our cash flow projections include known and observable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model. As required by IFRS Accounting Standards, estimates of future cash flows exclude estimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to carry out the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring costs.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of equity assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a capital asset pricing model ('CAPM') and market implied cost of equity. CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market's assessment of the economic variables and management's judgement. The discount rates for each CGU are refined to reflect the rates of inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, with the cost of equity rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets. The impacts of climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable in discount rates and asset prices.\n\n## Long-term growth rate\n\nThe long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of business units making up the CGUs. These growth rates reflect inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates or from which it derives revenue.\n\n## Sensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU\n\nAt 1 October 2023, given the extent by which VIU exceeds carrying amount, the HBUK WPB CGU was not sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the VIU calculation, such as the external range of discount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections. None of the remaining CGUs are individually significant.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nImpairment of other intangible assets is assessed in accordance with our policy explained in Note 1.2(n) by comparing the net carrying amount of CGUs containing intangible assets with their recoverable amounts. Recoverable amounts are determined by calculating an estimated VIU or fair value, as appropriate, for each CGU. No significant impairment was recognised during the year.\n\n## Key assumptions in VIU calculation\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of other intangible assets in the next financial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental. We used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n- -Management's judgement in estimating future cash flows: We considered past business performance, current market conditions and our macroeconomic outlook to estimate future earnings. As required by IFRS Accounting Standards, estimates of future cash flows exclude estimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to carry out the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring costs. For some businesses, this means that the benefit of certain strategic actions may not be included in the impairment assessment, including capital releases. Our cash flow projections include known and observable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model.\n- -Long-term growth rates: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective of the businesses within the Group.\n- -Discount rates: Rates are based on a combination of CAPM and market-implied calculations considering market data for the businesses and geographies in which the Group operates. The impacts of climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable in discount rates and asset prices.\n\n## Sensitivity of estimates relating to non-financial assets\n\nAs explained in Note 1.2(a), estimates of future cash flows for CGUs are made in the review of goodwill and non-financial assets for impairment. Non-financial assets include other intangible assets shown above, and owned property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (see Note 22). The most significant sources of estimation uncertainty are in respect of the goodwill balances disclosed above. There are no nonfinancial asset balances relating to individual CGUs which involve estimation uncertainty that represents a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the results and financial position of the Group within the next financial year.\n\nNon-financial assets are widely distributed across CGUs within the legal entities of the Group, including Corporate Centre assets that cannot be allocated to CGUs and are therefore tested for impairment at consolidated level. The recoverable amounts of other intangible assets, owned property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets cannot be lower than individual asset fair values less costs to dispose, where relevant. At 31 December 2023 none of the CGUs were sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the VIU calculation, such as the external range of discount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections.",

The sale also included HSBC Continental Europe's 100% ownership interest in HSBC SFH (France) and its 3% ownership interest in Cr\u00e9dit Logement.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the sale had become less certain, as a result of which we recognised a $2.1bn partial reversal of the impairment loss recognised in 2022, when the disposal group was classified as held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other relevant conditions, we reclassified the disposal group as held for sale, and it was subsequently remeasured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in the reinstatement of a \u20ac1.8bn ($2.0bn) pre-tax impairment loss reflecting the final terms of the sale, giving rise to a net reversal of impairment recognised in other operating income in the year of $0.1bn.\n\nUpon completion and in accordance with the terms of the sale, HSBC Continental Europe received a \u20ac0.1bn ($0.1bn) profit participation interest in the ultimate holding company of My Money Group. The associated impacts on initial recognition of this stake at fair value were recognised as part of the pre-tax loss on disposal. In addition, we recognised the reversal of a \u20ac0.4bn ($0.4bn) deferred tax liability, which had arisen as a consequence of the temporary difference in tax and accounting treatment in respect of the provision for loss on disposal, which was deductible in the French tax return in 2021.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the sale, HSBC Continental Europe retained a portfolio of \u20ac7.1bn ($7.8bn) consisting of home and certain other loans, in respect of which it may consider on-sale opportunities at a suitable time, and the CCF brand, which it licensed to the buyer under a long-term licence agreement. Additionally, HSBC Continental Europe's subsidiaries, HSBC Assurances Vie (France) and HSBC Global Asset Management (France), have entered into distribution agreements with the buyer. Ongoing costs associated with the retention of the home and certain other loans, net of income on distribution agreements and the brand licence, are estimated to have an after-tax loss impact of \u20ac0.1bn ($0.1bn) in 2024 based on expected funding rates.\n\n## Planned sale of our banking business in Canada\n\nOn 29 November 2022, HSBC Holdings plc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited, had entered into an agreement for the sale of its banking business in Canada to the Royal Bank of Canada. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2024 and the required governmental approvals have been obtained. The majority of the estimated gain on sale of $5.2bn (as at 31 December 2023) will be recognised on completion, reduced by earnings recognised by the Group in the period to completion. There would be no tax on the gain recognised at completion. This estimated gain would also have been reduced by $0.3bn in fair value losses recognised on the related foreign exchange hedges in 2023. The estimated pre-tax profit on the sale will be recognised through a combination of the consolidation of HSBC Canada's results into the Group's financial statements (between the 30 June 2022 net asset reference date and until completion), and the remaining gain on sale recognised at completion. At 31 December 2023, total assets of $87.9bn and total liabilities of $81.5bn met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.",

        "page_content": "## Planned sale of our business in Russia\n\nOn 30 June 2022, following a strategic review of our business in Russia, HSBC Europe BV (a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Bank plc) entered into an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary HSBC Bank (RR) (Limited Liability Company). In 2022, a $0.3bn impairment loss on the planned sale was recognised, upon classification as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. As at 31 December 2023, following US sanctions designation of the buyer, the outcome of the planned sale became less certain. This resulted in the reversal of $0.2bn of the previously recognised loss, as the business was no longer classified as held for sale. However, owing to restrictions impacting the recoverability of assets in Russia, we recognised charges of $0.2bn in other operating income. Completion of the planned sale remains subject to regulatory approval. On completion, accumulated foreign currency translation reserves will be recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Our branch operations in Greece\n\nOn 24 May 2022, HSBC Continental Europe signed a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of its branch operations in Greece to Pancreta Bank SA. In the second quarter of 2022, we recognised a loss of $0.1bn upon reclassification as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. At completion on 28 July 2023, the disposal group included $0.3bn of loans and advances to customers and $1.1bn of customer accounts.\n\n## Merger of our business in Oman\n\nIn November 2022, HSBC Bank Oman SAOG entered into a binding merger agreement with Sohar International Bank SAOG, under which the two banks agreed to take the necessary steps to implement a merger by incorporation, whereby HSBC Bank Oman would merge into Sohar International Bank. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, the merger was completed on 17 August 2023 by way of dissolution and transfer of all the assets and liabilities of HSBC Bank Oman to Sohar International Bank, with the shareholders of HSBC Bank Oman receiving the consideration in cash and shares in Sohar International Bank. Separately, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited is in the process of establishing a new wholesale banking branch in Oman subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n## Our New Zealand loan portfolio\n\nIn August 2023, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (acting through its New Zealand branch) entered into an agreement with Pepper New Zealand Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pepper Money Limited, to sell its New Zealand retail mortgage loan portfolio. The sale was classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2023 and was completed on 1 December 2023.\n\n## Our retail business in Mauritius\n\nIn November 2023, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (acting through its Mauritius branch) entered into an agreement with ABSA Bank (Mauritius) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABSA Bank Group Limited, to sell its Wealth and Personal Banking business. The sale is expected to complete in the second half of 2024 subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the major classes of assets and associated liabilities of disposal groups held for sale, excluding allocated impairment losses, were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                      | Canada $m             | Retail banking  operations in France $m   | Other 1 $m   | Total $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Assets of disposal groups held for sale                                                              |                       |                                           |              |            |\n| Cash and balances at central banks 2                                                                 | 5,370                 | 226                                       | -

The acquisition was funded from existing resources and brought the staff, assets and liabilities of SVB UK into the HSBC portfolio. On acquisition, we performed a preliminary assessment of the fair value of the assets and liabilities purchased. We established an opening balance sheet on 13 March 2023 and applied the result of the fair value assessment, which resulted in a reduction in net assets of $0.2bn. The provisional gain on acquisition of $1.6bn represents the difference between the consideration paid of \u00a31 and the net assets acquired. Further due diligence has been performed post-acquisition, resulting in the recognition of an additional gain of $0.1bn at 30 September 2023, as required by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nHSBC Innovation Bank Limited contributed $0.5bn of revenue and $0.2bn to the Group profit after tax for the period from 13 March 2023 to 31 December 2023. As per the disclosure requirements set out in IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', if HSBC Innovation Bank Limited had been acquired on 1 January 2023, management estimates that for the 12 months to 31 December 2023, consolidated revenue would have been $66bn and consolidated profit after tax would have been $25bn. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the previously determined fair value adjustments, which arose on acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023.\n\nThe details of the business combination at acquisition are as follows:\n\n|                                           | At 13 Mar 2023 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Fair value of assets acquired             | 11,367              |\n| Fair value of liabilities acquired        | (9,776)             |\n| Fair value of net assets acquired         | 1,591               |\n| Provisional gain on acquisition           | 1,591               |\n| Consideration transferred settled in cash | -                   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents acquired        | 1,243               |\n| Net cash inflow on acquisition            | 1,243               |",

Legal proceedings include civil court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings brought against HSBC companies (whether by way of claim or counterclaim); or civil disputes that may, if not settled, result in court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings. 'Regulatory matters' refers to investigations, reviews and other actions carried out by, or in response to, the actions of regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with alleged wrongdoing by HSBC.",

Customer remediation is often initiated by HSBC in response to customer complaints and/or industry developments in sales practices, and is not necessarily initiated by regulatory action.\n\nFor further details of the impact of IFRS 9 on undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees, presented in 'Contractual commitments', see Note 34. Further analysis of the movement in the expected credit loss provision is disclosed within the 'Reconciliation of changes in gross carrying/nominal amount and allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers including loan commitments and financial guarantees' table on page 169.\n\n## Brazil PIS and COFINS tax matters\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, HSBC Bank Brasil S.A. - Banco M\u00faltiplo ('HSBC Brazil') and other financial services firms brought legal proceedings in Brazil challenging the assessment of PIS and COFINS taxes, which are federal taxes imposed on gross revenues earned by legal entities in Brazil. The Supreme Court of Brazil selected three cases - one involving an insurer, in 2007, and two involving other banks, in 2011 - to set standards that would apply to all of these proceedings. In June 2023, the court ruled against the financial services firms in all three cases. The standards set by the court in this ruling have not yet been applied to HSBC Brazil's legacy cases, liability for which remained with HSBC after the sale of HSBC's operations in Brazil to Bradesco in 2016. There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes and any resulting financial impact for HSBC. Based upon the information currently available, a provision was recognised in respect of one legacy case. The remaining additional tax liability subject to challenge on all legacy PIS and COFINS cases is up to $0.4bn.\n\n## 29 Subordinated liabilities\n\n## HSBC's subordinated liabilities\n\n|                                    | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At amortised cost                  | 24,954    | 22,290    |\n| -  subordinated liabilities        | 23,149    | 20,547    |\n| -  preferred securities            | 1,805     | 1,743     |\n| Designated at fair value (Note 25) | 11,477    | 9,636     |\n| -  subordinated liabilities        | 11,477    | 9,636     |\n| -  preferred securities            | -         | -         |\n| At 31 Dec                          | 36,431    | 31,926    |\n| Issued by HSBC subsidiaries        | 4,154     | 6,094     |\n| Issued by HSBC Holdings            | 32,277    | 25,832    |\n\nSubordinated liabilities rank behind senior obligations and generally count towards the capital base of HSBC. Capital securities may be called and redeemed by HSBC subject to prior notification to the PRA and, where relevant, the consent of the local banking regulator. If not redeemed at the first call date, coupons payable may reset or become floating rate based on relevant market rates. On subordinated liabilities other than floating rate notes, interest is payable at fixed rates of up to 10.176%.\n\nThe balance sheet amounts disclosed in the following table are presented on an IFRS basis and do not reflect the amount that the instruments contribute to regulatory capital, principally due to regulatory amortisation and regulatory eligibility limits.\n\n## HSBC's subordinated liabilities: subsidiaries\n\n|                                                                                      | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Additional tier 1 capital securities issued by HSBC subsidiaries                     | 1,672     | 1,584     |\n| Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC subsidiaries                                        |           |           |\n| -  Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC Bank plc                                         | 764       | 2,427     |\n| -  Tier 2 securities issued by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | -         | 400       |\n| -  Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC Bank USA Inc                                     | 223       | 223       |\n| -  Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC Bank USA N.A.                                    | 1,449     | 1,405     |\n| -  Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC Bank Canada 1                                    | -         | -         |\n| Securities issued by other HSBC subsidiaries                                         | 46        | 55        |\n| Subordinated liabilities issued by HSBC subsidiaries at 31 Dec                       | 4,154     | 6,094     |\n\n## HSBC Holdings' subordinated liabilities\n\n|                                    | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At amortised cost                  | 24,439    | 19,727    |\n| Designated at fair value (Note 25) | 8,449     | 6,700     |\n| At 31 Dec                          | 32,888    | 26,427    |\n\n## HSBC Holdings' subordinated liabilities in issue\n\n|                                                            | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Tier 2 securities issued by HSBC Holdings                  |           |           |\n| Amounts owed to third parties                              | 31,975    | 25,527    |\n| Amounts owed to HSBC undertakings                          | 913       | 900       |\n| Subordinated liabilities issued by HSBC Holdings at 31 Dec | 32,888    | 26,427    |",

        "page_content": "## Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc\n\nCapital securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc were issued by the Jersey limited partnerships. The proceeds of these were lent to the respective guarantors by the limited partnerships in the form of subordinated notes. They qualified as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC under CRR II until 31 December 2021 by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. The capital security guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc also qualified as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank plc (on a solo and a consolidated basis) under CRR II until 31 December 2021 by virtue of the same grandfathering process. Since 31 December 2021, these securities have no longer qualified as regulatory capital for HSBC or HSBC Bank plc.\n\nThese preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon liquidation of the relevant issuer that are equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased noncumulative perpetual preference shares of the relevant issuer. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBC's capital adequacy requirements, or if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc has insufficient distributable reserves (as defined).\n\nHSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank plc have individually covenanted that, if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, they will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or repurchase or redeem their ordinary shares, until the distribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full.\n\nIf the consolidated total capital ratio of HSBC Holdings falls below the regulatory minimum required or if the Directors expect it to do so in the near term, provided that proceedings have not been commenced for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of HSBC Holdings, the holders' interests in the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings will be exchanged for interests in preference shares issued by HSBC Holdings that have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to the preferred securities and their guarantee.\n\nIf the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc are outstanding in November 2048, or if the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank plc (on a solo or consolidated basis) falls below the regulatory minimum required, or if the Directors expect it to do so in the near term, provided that proceedings have not been commenced for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of HSBC Bank plc, the holders' interests in the preferred security guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc will be exchanged for interests in preference shares issued by HSBC Bank plc that have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to the preferred security and its guarantee.\n\n## Tier 2 securities\n\nTier 2 capital securities are either perpetual or dated subordinated securities on which there is an obligation to pay coupons. These capital securities are included within HSBC's regulatory capital base as tier 2 capital under CRR II, either as fully eligible capital or by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. In accordance with CRR II, the capital contribution of all tier 2 securities is amortised for regulatory purposes in their final five years before maturity.\n\n## 30 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments\n\nThe table on page 408 provides an analysis of consolidated total assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by residual contractual maturity at the balance sheet date. These balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:\n\n- -Trading assets and liabilities (including trading derivatives but excluding reverse repos, repos and debt securities in issue) are included in the 'Due not more than 1 month' time bucket because trading balances are typically held for short periods of time.\n- -Financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as equity securities) are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period, which the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket.\n- -Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket.\n- -Financial instruments included within assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are classified on the basis of the contractual maturity of the underlying instruments and not on the basis of the disposal transaction.\n- -Liabilities under insurance contracts included in 'other financial liabilities' are irrespective of contractual maturity included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket in the maturity table provided below. An analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows of insurance contract liabilities and contractual service margin is provided on page 411. Liabilities under investment contracts are classified in accordance with their contractual maturity. Undated investment contracts are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket, although such contracts are subject to surrender and transfer options by the policyholders.\n- -Loan and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.",

For this reason, balances in the following table do not agree directly with those in our consolidated balance sheet. Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to their contractual maturities. Trading liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'Due not more than 1 month' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.\n\nIn addition, loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are generally not recognised on our balance sheet. The undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be called.\n\nCash flows payable by HSBC under financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities\n\n|                                                   | Due not  more than 1  month $m   | Due over 1 month but not more  than 3 months $m   | Due over 3 months but not more than 1 year $m   | Due over 1 year but  not more than 5 years $m   | Due over 5 years $m   | Total $m           |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Deposits by banks                                 | 52,938                           | 2,898                                             | 3,304                                           | 17,123                                          | 362                   | 76,625             |\n| Customer accounts                                 | 1,345,006                        | 141,348                                           | 119,660                                         | 13,423                                          | 109                   | 1,619,546          |\n| Repurchase agreements -

HSBC Holdings also raises funds in the debt capital markets to meet the Group's minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities and maintain an appropriate liquidity buffer. HSBC Holdings uses this liquidity to meet its obligations, including interest and principal repayments on external debt liabilities, operating expenses and collateral on derivative transactions.\n\nHSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent liquidity risk by virtue of credit-related commitments and guarantees and similar contracts issued relating to its subsidiaries. Such commitments and guarantees are only issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings' ability to finance the commitments and guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising.\n\nHSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding company level. During 2023, consistent with the Group's capital plan, the Group's material subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments from material subsidiaries. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.\n\nHSBC Holdings currently has sufficient liquidity to meet its present and forecast requirements. Liquidity risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by Holdings ALCO.",

For this reason, balances in the following table do not agree directly with those in HSBC Holdings balance sheet. Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to their contractual maturities. Trading liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'Due not more than 1 month' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.\n\nIn addition, loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are generally not recognised on our balance sheet. The undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be called.\n\nCash flows payable by HSBC Holdings under financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities\n\n|                                                | Due not  more than 1  month $m   | Due over 1 month but  not more than 3 months $m   | Due over 3 months but not more  than 1 year $m   | Due over 1 year but not more than 5 years $m   | Due over 5 years $m   | Total $m      |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Amounts owed to HSBC undertakings              | -

This is achieved when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is either an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nIn the following table, the 'Amounts not set off in the balance sheet' include transactions where:\n\n- -the counterparty has an offsetting exposure with HSBC and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offset criteria are otherwise not satisfied; and\n- -cash and non-cash collateral (debt securities and equities) has been received/pledged for derivatives and reverse repurchase/repurchase, stock borrowing/lending and similar agreements to cover net exposure in the event of a default or other predetermined events.\n\nThe effect of over-collateralisation is excluded.\n\n'Amounts not subject to enforceable netting agreements' include contracts executed in jurisdictions where the rights of offset may not be upheld under the local bankruptcy laws, and transactions where a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the right of offset may not have been sought, or may have been unable to obtain.\n\nFor risk management purposes, the net amounts of loans and advances to customers are subject to limits, which are monitored and the relevant customer agreements are subject to review and updated, as necessary, to ensure the legal right to set off remains appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Other equity instruments\n\nHSBC Holdings has included two types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital, including the contingent convertible securities described below. These are accounted for as equity because HSBC does not have an obligation to transfer cash or a variable number of its own ordinary shares to holders under any circumstances outside its control. See Note 29 for additional tier 1 securities accounted for as liabilities.\n\n## Additional tier 1 capital - contingent convertible securities\n\nHSBC Holdings continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1 capital securities on an end point basis. These securities are marketed principally and subsequently allotted to corporate investors and fund managers. The net proceeds of the issuances are typically used for HSBC Holdings' general corporate purposes and to further strengthen its capital base to meet requirements under CRR II. These securities bear a fixed rate of interest until their initial call dates. After the initial call dates, if they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on credit spreads, fixed at issuance, above prevailing market rates. Interest on the contingent convertible securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of HSBC Holdings, and HSBC Holdings has sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel for any reason (in whole or part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any payment date. Distributions will not be paid if they are prohibited under UK banking regulations or if the Group has insufficient reserves or fails to meet the solvency conditions defined in the securities' terms.\n\nThe contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable at the option of HSBC Holdings in whole typically at the initial call date or on any fifth anniversary after this date. In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA. These securities rank pari passu with HSBC Holdings' sterling preference shares and therefore rank ahead of ordinary shares. The contingent convertible securities will be converted into fully paid ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings at a predetermined price, should HSBC's consolidated non-transitional CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%. Therefore, in accordance with the terms of the securities, if the non-transitional CET1 ratio breaches the 7.0% trigger, the securities will convert into ordinary shares at fixed contractual conversion prices in the issuance currencies of the relevant securities, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.\n\n## HSBC's additional tier 1 capital - contingent convertible securities in issue which are accounted for in equity\n\n| Original nominal  amount (LCY)   |                                                                   | First call date   | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| $2,250m                          | 6.375% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | Sep 2024          | 2,250     | 2,250     |\n| $2,450m                          | 6.375% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | Mar 2025          | 2,450     | 2,450     |\n| $3,000m                          | 6.000% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | May 2027          | 3,000     | 3,000     |\n| $2,350m                          | 6.250% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 1 | Mar 2023          | -         | 2,350     |\n| $1,800m                          | 6.500% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | Mar 2028          | 1,800     | 1,800     |\n| $1,500m                          | 4.600% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 2 | Dec 2030          | 1,500     | 1,500     |\n| \u20ac1,000m                          | 4.000% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securitiess  | Mar 2026          | 1,000     | 1,000     |\n| $1,000m                          | 4.700% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 4 | Mar 2031          | 1,000     | 1,000     |\n| $2,000m                          | 8.000% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 5 | Mar 2028          | 1,980     | -         |\n| \u20ac1,000m                          | 6.000% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 6 | Sep 2023          | -         | 1,123     |\n| \u20ac1,250m                          | 4.750% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | Jul 2029          | 1,422     | 1,422     |\n| S$750m                           | 5.000% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities 7 | Sep 2023          | -         | 550       |\n| \u20ac1,000m                          | 5.875% perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities   | Sep 2026          | 1,301     | 1,301     |\n| At 31 Dec                        | At 31 Dec                                                         |                   | 17,703    | 19,746    |\n\n- 1   This security was called by HSBC Holdings on 30 January 2023 and redeemed and cancelled on 23 March 2023.\n- 2   This security was issued by HSBC Holdings on 17 December 2020.

As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements. The expected credit loss provision relating to guarantees and commitments under IFRS 9 is disclosed in Note 28.\n\nThe majority of the guarantees have a term of less than one year, while guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBC's annual credit review process.\n\nContingent liabilities arising from legal proceedings, regulatory and other matters against Group companies are excluded from this note but are disclosed in Notes 28 and 36.\n\n## Financial Services Compensation Scheme\n\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme ('FSCS') provides compensation, up to certain limits, to eligible customers of financial services firms that are unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against them. The FSCS may impose a further levy on the Group to the extent the industry levies imposed to date are not sufficient to cover the compensation due to customers in any future possible collapse. The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of a collapse cannot be estimated reliably. It is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recovery of assets by the FSCS, changes in the level of protected products (including deposits and investments) and the population of FSCS members at the time.\n\n## Associates\n\nHSBC's share of associates' contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees amounted to $69.9bn at 31 December 2023 (2022: $64.8bn). No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.\n\n## 35 Finance lease receivables\n\nHSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft), property and general plant and machinery. At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms. Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.\n\nThe table below excludes finance lease receivables reclassified on the balance sheet to 'Assets held for sale' in accordance with IFRS 5. Net investment in finance leases of $1,595m (2022: $1,502m) was reclassified to 'Assets held for sale' as a result of the planned sale of our banking business in Canada.\n\n|                                                  | 2023                             | 2023                       | 2023             | 2022                             | 2022                       | 2022             |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n|                                                  | Total future minimum payments $m | Unearned finance income $m | Present value $m | Total future minimum payments $m | Unearned finance income $m | Present value $m |\n| Lease receivables:                               |                                  |                            |                  |                                  |                            |                  |\n| No later than one year                           | 2,355                            | (308)                      | 2,047            | 2,159                            | (236)                      | 1,923            |\n| One to two years                                 | 1,954                            | (249)                      | 1,705            | 1,652                            | (201)                      | 1,451            |\n| Two to three years                               | 1,380                            | (189)                      | 1,191            | 1,391                            | (161)                      | 1,230            |\n| Three to four years                              | 930                              | (153)                      | 777              | 906                              | (131)                      | 775              |\n| Four to five years                               | 593                              | (132)                      | 461              | 613                              | (112)                      | 501              |\n| Later than one year and no later than five years | 4,857                            | (723)                      | 4,134            | 4,562                            | (605)                      | 3,957            |\n| Later than five years                            | 4,116                            | (838)                      | 3,278            | 4,064                            | (736)                      | 3,328            |\n| At 31 Dec                                        | 11,328                           | (1,869)                    | 9,459            | 10,785                           | (1,577)                    | 9,208            |",

        "page_content": "## 36 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters\n\nHSBC is party to legal proceedings and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its normal business operations. Apart from the matters described below, HSBC considers that none of these matters are material. The recognition of provisions is determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1 . While the outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are inherently uncertain, management believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in respect of these matters as at 31 December 2023 (see Note 28). Where an individual provision is material, the fact that a provision has been made is stated and quantified, except to the extent that doing so would be seriously prejudicial. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.\n\n## Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\n\nVarious non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds incorporated outside the US whose assets were invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC ('Madoff Securities'). Based on information provided by Madoff Securities as at 30 November 2008, the purported aggregate value of these funds was $8.4bn, including fictitious profits reported by Madoff. Based on information available to HSBC, the funds' actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual withdrawals from Madoff Securities during the time HSBC serviced the funds are estimated to have totalled approximately $4bn. Various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of Madoff Securities' fraud.\n\nUS litigation: The Madoff Securities Trustee has brought lawsuits against various HSBC companies and others, seeking recovery of alleged transfers from Madoff Securities to HSBC in the amount of $543m (plus interest), and these lawsuits remain pending in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'US Bankruptcy Court').\n\nCertain Fairfield entities (together, 'Fairfield') (in liquidation) have brought a lawsuit in the US against fund shareholders, including HSBC companies that acted as nominees for clients, seeking restitution of redemption payments in the amount of $382m (plus interest). Fairfield's claims against most of the HSBC companies have been dismissed by the US Bankruptcy Court and the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, but remain pending on appeal before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Fairfield's claims against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA and HSBC Securities Services Luxembourg ('HSSL') have not been dismissed and their appeals are also pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Meanwhile, proceedings before the US Bankruptcy Court with respect to the claims against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA and HSSL are ongoing.\n\nUK litigation: The Madoff Securities Trustee has filed a claim against various HSBC companies in the High Court of England and Wales, seeking recovery of transfers from Madoff Securities to HSBC. The claim has not yet been served and the amount claimed has not been specified.\n\nCayman Islands litigation: In February 2013, Primeo Fund ('Primeo') (in liquidation) brought an action against HSSL and Bank of Bermuda (Cayman) Limited (now known as HSBC Cayman Limited), alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty and claiming damages. Following dismissal of Primeo's action by the Grand Court and Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands, in 2019, Primeo appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In November 2023, the Privy Council issued a judgment upholding the dismissal of Primeo's claims. This matter is now closed.\n\nLuxembourg litigation: In 2009, Herald Fund SPC ('Herald') (in liquidation) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of cash and securities in the amount of $2.5bn (plus interest), or damages in the amount of $2bn (plus interest). In 2018, HSBC Bank plc was added to the claim and Herald increased the amount of the alleged damages claim to $5.6bn (plus interest). The Luxembourg District Court has dismissed Herald's securities restitution claim, but reserved Herald's cash restitution and damages claims. Herald has appealed this dismissal to the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, where the matter is pending.\n\nBeginning in 2009, various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in a number of actions brought by Alpha Prime Fund Limited ('Alpha Prime') in the Luxembourg District Court seeking damages for alleged breach of contract and negligence in the amount of $1.16bn (plus interest). These matters are currently pending before the Luxembourg District Court.\n\nBeginning in 2014, HSSL and the Luxembourg branch of HSBC Bank plc have been named as defendants in a number of actions brought by Senator Fund SPC ('Senator') before the Luxembourg District Court seeking restitution of securities in the amount of $625m (plus interest), or damages in the amount of $188m (plus interest). These matters are currently pending before the Luxembourg District Court.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of the pending matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## US Anti-Terrorism Act litigation\n\nSince November 2014, a number of lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in the US against various HSBC companies and others on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are related to, alleged victims of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. In each case, it is alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of various sanctioned parties in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, or provided banking services to customers alleged to have connections to terrorism financing. Seven actions, which seek damages for unspecified amounts, remain pending and HSBC's motions to dismiss have been granted in three of these cases. These dismissals are subject to appeals and/or the plaintiffs repleading their claims. The four other actions are at an early stage.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.",

        "page_content": "## Interbank offered rates investigation and litigation\n\nEuro interest rate derivatives: In December 2016, the European Commission ('EC') issued a decision finding that HSBC, among other banks, engaged in anti-competitive practices in connection with the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives, and the EC imposed a fine on HSBC based on a one-month infringement in 2007. The fine was annulled in 2019 and a lower fine was imposed in 2021. In January 2023, the European Court of Justice dismissed an appeal by HSBC and upheld the EC's findings on HSBC's liability. A separate appeal by HSBC concerning the amount of the fine remains pending before the General Court of the European Union.\n\nUS dollar Libor: Beginning in 2011, HSBC and other panel banks have been named as defendants in a number of individual and putative class action lawsuits filed in federal and state courts in the US with respect to the setting of US dollar Libor. The complaints assert claims under various US federal and state laws, including antitrust and racketeering laws and the Commodity Exchange Act ('US CEA'). HSBC has concluded class settlements with five groups of plaintiffs, and several class action lawsuits brought by other groups of plaintiffs have been voluntarily dismissed. A number of individual US dollar Libor-related actions seeking damages for unspecified amounts remain pending.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of the pending matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## Foreign exchange-related investigations and litigation\n\nIn December 2016, Brazil's Administrative Council of Economic Defense initiated an investigation into the onshore foreign exchange market and identified a number of banks, including HSBC, as subjects of its investigation, which remains ongoing.\n\nSince 2017, HSBC Bank plc, among other financial institutions, has been defending a complaint filed by the Competition Commission of South Africa before the South African Competition Tribunal for alleged anti-competitive behaviour in the South African foreign exchange market. In 2020, a revised complaint was filed which also named HSBC Bank USA N.A. ('HSBC Bank USA') as a defendant. In January 2024, the South African Competition Appeal Court dismissed HSBC Bank USA from the revised complaint, but denied HSBC Bank plc's application to dismiss. The Competition Commission has appealed the dismissal of HSBC Bank USA to the Constitutional Court of South Africa.\n\nSince 2015, various HSBC companies and other banks have been named as defendants in a putative class action in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York filed by a group of retail customers who dealt in foreign exchange products. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to manipulate foreign exchange rates and seek damages for unspecified amounts. This action has been dismissed but remains pending on appeal.\n\nIn January 2023, HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Holdings reached a settlement-in-principle with plaintiffs in Israel to resolve a class action filed in the local courts alleging foreign exchange-related misconduct. The settlement remains subject to court approval. Lawsuits alleging foreign exchange-related misconduct remain pending against HSBC and other banks in courts in Brazil.\n\nIn February 2024, HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Holdings were joined to an existing claim brought in the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal against various other banks alleging historical anti-competitive behaviour in the foreign exchange market and seeking damages for unspecified amounts. This matter is at an early stage. It is possible that additional civil actions will be initiated against HSBC in relation to its historical foreign exchange activities.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the pending matters, which could be significant.\n\n## Precious metals fix-related litigation\n\nUS litigation: HSBC and other members of The London Silver Market Fixing Limited are defending a class action pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, from January 2007 to December 2013, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. In May 2023, this action, which seeks damages for unspecified amounts, was dismissed but remains pending on appeal.\n\nHSBC and other members of The London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Limited are defending a class action pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, from January 2008 to November 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of platinum group metals and related financial products for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the US CEA. In February 2023, the court reversed an earlier dismissal of the plaintiffs' third amended complaint and this action, which seeks damages for unspecified amounts, is proceeding.\n\nCanada litigation: HSBC and other financial institutions are defending putative class actions filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts of Justice alleging that the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver, gold and related derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and common law. These actions each seek CA$1bn in damages plus CA$250m in punitive damages. Two of the actions are proceeding and the others have been stayed.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## Tax-related investigations\n\nVarious tax administration, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world are conducting investigations in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross-border banking solicitation. HSBC continues to cooperate with these investigations.\n\nIn March 2023, the French National Financial Prosecutor announced an investigation into a number of banks, including HSBC Continental Europe and the Paris branch of HSBC Bank plc, in connection with alleged tax fraud related to the dividend withholding tax treatment of certain trading activities. HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Germany also continue to cooperate with investigations by the German public prosecutor into numerous financial institutions and their employees, in connection with the dividend withholding tax treatment of certain trading activities.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.",

        "page_content": "## Gilts trading investigation and litigation\n\nSince 2018, the UK Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA') has been investigating HSBC and four other banks for suspected anticompetitive conduct in relation to the historical trading of gilts and related derivatives. In May 2023, the CMA announced its case against HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Holdings; both HSBC companies are contesting the CMA's allegations.\n\nIn June 2023, HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., among other banks, were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by plaintiffs alleging anti-competitive conduct in the gilts market and seeking damages for unspecified amounts. In September 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss which remains pending. It is possible that additional civil actions will be initiated against HSBC in relation to its historical gilts trading activities.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## UK depositor protection arrangements investigation\n\nIn January 2022, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') commenced an investigation into HSBC Bank plc's and HSBC UK Bank plc's compliance with depositor protection arrangements under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the UK. In January 2024, the PRA concluded its investigation and imposed a \u00a357m fine on HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc, which has been paid, and this matter is now closed.\n\n## UK collections and recoveries investigation\n\nSince 2019, the FCA has been investigating HSBC Bank plc's, HSBC UK Bank plc's and Marks and Spencer Financial Services plc's compliance with regulatory standards relating to collections and recoveries operations in the UK between 2017 and 2018. HSBC continues to cooperate with this investigation.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of this matter, which could be significant.\n\n## Korean short selling investigation\n\nIn December 2023, the Korean Securities and Futures Commission issued a decision to impose a fine on The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in connection with trades in breach of Korean short selling rules and to refer the case to the Korean Prosecutors' Office for investigation.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of this matter, which could be significant.\n\n## Silicon Valley Bank ('SVB') litigation\n\nIn May 2023, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company ('First Citizens') brought a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against various HSBC companies and seven US-based HSBC employees who had previously worked for SVB. The lawsuit seeks $1bn in damages and alleges, among other things, that the various HSBC companies conspired with the individual defendants to solicit employees from First Citizens and that the individual defendants took confidential information belonging to SVB and/or First Citizens. In January 2024, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss in part and granted it in part, and directed the plaintiff to amend its complaint to specify its allegations as to each defendant. In February 2024, First Citizens filed its amended complaint. This action is ongoing.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## Film Finance litigation\n\nIn June 2020, two separate investor groups issued claims against HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited ('PBGB')) in the High Court of England and Wales seeking damages for unspecified amounts in connection with PBGB's role in the development of Eclipse film finance schemes. These actions are ongoing.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## US mortgage securitisation litigation\n\nBeginning in 2014, a number of lawsuits were filed in various state and federal courts in the US against HSBC Bank USA, as a trustee of more than 280 mortgage securitisation trusts, seeking unspecified damages for losses in collateral value allegedly sustained by the trusts. HSBC Bank USA has reached settlements with a number of plaintiffs to resolve nearly all of these lawsuits. The remaining two actions are pending in a New York state court. HSBC Bank USA and certain of its affiliates continue to defend a mortgage loan repurchase action seeking unspecified damages and specific performance brought by the trustee of a mortgage securitisation trust in New York state court.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the pending matters, which could be significant.\n\n## Mexican government bond litigation\n\nHSBC Mexico S.A. and other banks are named as defendants in a consolidated putative class action pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging anti-competitive conduct in the Mexican government bond market between 2006 and 2017 and seeking damages for unspecified amounts. In February 2024, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an earlier dismissal of this lawsuit and this matter is proceeding.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## Stanford litigation\n\nSince 2009, HSBC Bank plc has been named as a defendant in numerous claims filed in courts in the UK and the US arising from the collapse of Stanford International Bank Ltd, for which it was a correspondent bank from 2003 to 2009. In February 2023, HSBC Bank plc reached settlements with the plaintiffs to resolve these claims. The US settlement is subject to court approval and the UK settlement has concluded.",

KMP are defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of HSBC Holdings. These individuals also constitute 'senior management' for the purposes of the Hong Kong Listing Rules. In applying IAS 24, it was determined that for this financial reporting period all KMP included Directors, former Directors and senior management listed on pages 239 to 246 except for the roles of Group Chief Legal Officer, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Chief Human Resources Officer, Group Chief Sustainability Officer, Group Head of Strategy, Group Chief Communications and Brand Officer, and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer who do not meet the criteria for KMP as provided for in the standard.\n\nParticulars of transactions with related parties are tabulated below.

At 31 December 2023, HSBC's post-employment benefit plans had placed deposits of $402m (2022: $369m) with its banking subsidiaries, earning interest payable to the schemes of $2m (2022: nil). The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties.\n\nThe combined HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme enters into swap transactions with HSBC to manage inflation and interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities and selected assets.

The PVIF intangible asset is no longer reported following the transition to IFRS 17, as future profits are deferred within the CSM. Other IFRS 4 insurance contract assets (shown above within 'All other assets') and insurance contract liabilities are removed on transition, to be replaced with IFRS 17 balances.\n\n## Remeasurement effect of IFRS 9 re-designations\n\nLoans and advances of $1,849m and debt securities of $53,201m, both supporting associated insurance liabilities, were re-designated from an amortised cost classification to fair value through profit and loss. Debt securities supporting the associated insurance liabilities of $1,068m were reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income to fair value through profit or loss. The re-designations were made in order to more closely align the asset accounting with the valuation of the associated insurance liabilities. The re-designation of amortised cost assets generated a net increase to assets of $4,873m because the fair value measurement on transition was higher than the previous amortised cost carrying amount.\n\n## Recognition of the IFRS 17 fulfilment cash flows\n\nThe measurement of the insurance contracts liabilities under IFRS 17 is based on groups of insurance contracts and includes a liability for fulfilling the insurance contracts, such as premiums, directly attributable expenses, insurance benefits and claims including policyholder returns and the cost of guarantees. These are recorded within the fulfilment cash flow component of the insurance contract liability, together with the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\n## Recognition of the IFRS 17 contractual service margin\n\nThe CSM is a component of the insurance contract liability and represents the future unearned profit associated with insurance contracts that will be released to the profit and loss over the expected coverage period.\n\n## Tax effect\n\nThe removal of deferred tax liabilities primarily results from the removal of the associated PVIF intangible asset, and new deferred tax assets are reported, where appropriate, on temporary differences between the new IFRS 17 accounting balances and their associated tax bases.",

This includes the removal of the value of new business and changes to PVIF intangible asset from valuation adjustments and experience variances.\n\nOn the implementation of IFRS 17, new income statement line items associated with insurance contract accounting were introduced. Consequently, the previously reported IFRS 4 line items 'Net insurance premium income' and 'Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders' were also removed.\n\n## Remeasurement effect of IFRS 9 re-designations\n\nFollowing the re-designation of financial assets supporting associated insurance liabilities to fair value through profit or loss classification, the related income statement reporting also changed. Under our previous IFRS 4-based reporting convention, these assets generated interest income of $2,233m for the year ended 31 December 2022, which is no longer reported in 'Net interest income' under IFRS 17. To the extent that this interest income was shared with policyholders, the corresponding policyholder sharing obligation was previously included within the 'net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders' line.\n\nFollowing re-designation to fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of underlying assets, together with interest income earned, are both reported within 'Net expense from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss'. Similar to an IFRS 4 basis, IFRS 17 accounting provides for an offset. While this offset was reported within the claims line under IFRS 4, under IFRS 17 it is reported within the 'Insurance finance income/(expense)' line described below.",

        "page_content": "## Introduction of IFRS 17 income statement\n\n## Insurance finance income/(expense)\n\nInsurance finance income/(expense) of $13,799m for the year ended 31 December 2022 represents the change in the carrying amount of insurance contracts arising from the effect of, and changes in, the time value of money and financial risk. For variable fee approach contracts, which represent more than 90% of HSBC's insurance contracts, the insurance finance income/(expense) includes the changes in the fair value of underlying items (excluding additions and withdrawals). It therefore has an offsetting impact to investment income earned on underlying assets supporting insurance contracts. This includes an offsetting impact to the gains and losses on assets re-designated on transition to fair value through profit or loss, and which is now included in 'Net expense from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\n## Contractual service margin\n\nRevenue is recognised for the release of the CSM associated with the in-force business, which was allocated at a rate of approximately 9% during 2022. The CSM release is largely impacted by the constant measure allocation approach for investment services, but may vary over time primarily due to changes in the total amount of CSM reported on the balance sheet from factors such as new business written, the Group's share of investment experience, or changes to assumptions.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nLosses on onerous contracts are taken to the income statement as incurred.\n\n## Experience variance and other\n\n'Experience variance and other' represents the expected expenses, claims and recovery of acquisition cash flows, which are reported as part of the insurance revenue. This is offset with the actual expenses and claims incurred in the year and amortisation of acquisition cash flows, which are reported as part of insurance service expense.\n\n## Attributable expenses\n\nDirectly attributable expenses are the costs associated with originating and fulfilling an identified portfolio of insurance contracts. These costs include distribution fees paid to third parties as part of originating insurance contracts together with appropriate allocations of fixed and variable overheads, which are included within the fulfilment cash flows and are no longer shown on the operating expenses line, whereas nonattributable expenses remain in the operating expenses.\n\n## IFRS 17 transition impact on the Group comprehensive income\n\n|                                                                                | Year ended 31 Dec 2022   | Year ended 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                                | Under  IFRS 17 $m        | Under  IFRS 4 $m         |\n| Total equity at 1 Jan                                                          | 196,318                  | 206,777                  |\n| of which                                                                       |                          |                          |\n| -  retained earnings                                                           | 135,236                  | 144,458                  |\n| -  financial assets at FVOCI reserve                                           | 49                       | (634)                    |\n| -  insurance finance reserve                                                   | (696)                    | -                        |\n| Profit for the period                                                          | 16,249                   | 16,670                   |\n| Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income              | (7,232)                  | (5,468)                  |\n| Equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income | 107                      | 107                      |\n| Insurance finance income recognised in other comprehensive income              | 1,775                    | -                        |\n| Other comprehensive expense for the period, net of tax                         | (11,892)                 | (11,940)                 |\n| Total comprehensive (expense)/income for the period                            | (993)                    | (631)                    |\n| Other movements                                                                | (10,128)                 | (10,118)                 |\n| Total equity at 31 Dec                                                         | 185,197                  | 196,028                  |\n\n## Transition drivers\n\n## Insurance finance reserve\n\nThe insurance finance reserve reflects the impact of the adoption of the other comprehensive income option for our insurance business in France. Underlying assets supporting these contracts are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Under this option, only the amount that matches income or expenses recognised in profit or loss on underlying items is included in finance income or expenses, resulting in the elimination of income statement accounting mismatches. The remaining amount of finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts is recognised in OCI. At the transition date an insurance finance reserve of $696m was recognised and following transition, gains net of tax of $1,775m were recorded in the year ended 31 December 2022. An offsetting fair value through other comprehensive income reserve of $683m recorded on transition represents the accumulated fair value movements on assets supporting these insurance contract liabilities, with associated losses net of tax of $1,898m recorded within the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve for the year ended 31 December 2022.",

In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities, and whether power is held as an agent or principal. HSBC's consolidation policy is described in Note 1.2(a).\n- 1 Management has determined that these undertakings are excluded from consolidation in the Group accounts as these entities do not meet the definition of subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS. HSBC's consolidation policy is described in Note 1.2(a).\n\n|   2 | Directly held by HSBC Holdings plc       |\n|-----|------------------------------------------|\n|   3 | Preference Shares                        |\n|   4 | Actions                                  |\n|   5 | Redeemable Preference Shares             |\n|   6 | GmbH Anteil                              |\n|   7 | Limited and Unlimited Liability Shares   |\n|   8 | Liquidating Share Class                  |\n|   9 | Nominal Shares                           |\n|  10 | Non-Participating Voting Shares          |\n|  11 | Parts                                    |\n|  12 | Registered Capital Shares                |\n|  13 | Russian Limited Liability Company Shares |\n|  14 | St\u00fcckaktien                              |\n\n## Registered offices\n\n|   15 | c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street,  Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America, 19801                   |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   16 | 8 Canada Square, London, United Kingdom, E14 5HQ                                                                                |\n|   17 | Paseo de la Reforma 347 Col.

EPS for this purpose excludes material notable items and related impacts (including those associated with the sale of our retail banking operations in France, the agreed sale of our banking business in Canada and our acquisition of SVB UK). The Board has adopted a dividend policy designed to provide sustainable cash dividends, while retaining the flexibility to invest and grow the business in the future, supplemented by additional shareholder distributions, if appropriate.\n\nDividends are approved in US dollars and, at the election of the shareholder, paid in cash in one of, or in a combination of, US dollars, pounds sterling and Hong Kong dollars.\n\n## Other equity instruments\n\n## Additional tier 1 capital - contingent convertible securities\n\nHSBC continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1 capital securities.

        "page_content": "## Taxation of shares and dividends\n\n## Taxation - UK residents\n\nThe following is a summary, under current law (unless otherwise noted) and the current published practice of HM Revenue and Customs ('HMRC'), of certain UK tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares. In particular, the summary deals with shareholders who are resident solely in the UK for UK tax purposes and only with holders who hold the shares as investments and who are the beneficial owners of the shares, and does not address the tax treatment of certain classes of holders such as dealers in securities. Holders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\nCurrently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings.\n\n## UK resident individuals\n\nUK resident individuals are generally entitled to a tax-free annual allowance in respect of dividends received. The amount of the allowance for the tax year beginning 6 April 2023 is \u00a31,000. To the extent that dividend income received by an individual in the relevant tax year does not exceed the allowance, a nil tax rate will apply. Dividend income in excess of this allowance will be taxed at 8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate taxpayers and 39.35% for additional rate taxpayers.\n\n## UK resident companies\n\nShareholders that are within the charge to UK corporation tax should generally be entitled to an exemption from UK corporation tax on any dividends received from HSBC Holdings. However, the exemptions are not comprehensive and are subject to anti-avoidance rules.\n\nIf the conditions for exemption are not met or cease to be satisfied, or a shareholder within the charge to UK corporation tax elects for an otherwise exempt dividend to be taxable, the shareholder will be subject to UK corporation tax on dividends received from HSBC Holdings at the rate of corporation tax applicable to that shareholder.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nThe computation of the capital gains tax liability arising on disposals of shares in HSBC Holdings by shareholders subject to UK tax on capital gains can be complex, partly depending on whether, for example, the shares were purchased since April 1991, acquired in 1991 in exchange for shares in The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, or acquired subsequent to 1991 in exchange for shares in other companies.\n\nFor capital gains tax purposes, the acquisition cost for ordinary shares is adjusted to take account of subsequent rights and capitalisation issues. Any capital gain arising on a disposal of shares in HSBC Holdings by a UK company may also be adjusted to take account of indexation allowance if the shares were acquired before 1 January 2018, although the level of indexation allowance that is given in calculating the gain would be frozen at the value that would have been applied to a disposal of those shares in December 2017. If in doubt, shareholders are recommended to consult their professional advisers.\n\n## Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nTransfers of shares by a written instrument of transfer generally will be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer (rounded up to the next \u00a35), and such stamp duty is generally payable by the transferee. An agreement to transfer shares, or any interest therein, normally will give rise to a charge to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. However, provided an instrument of transfer of the shares is executed pursuant to the agreement and duly stamped before the date on which the stamp duty reserve tax becomes payable, under\n\nthe current published practice of HMRC it will not be necessary to pay the stamp duty reserve tax, nor to apply for such tax to be cancelled. Stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable by the transferee.\n\nPaperless transfers of shares within CREST, the UK's paperless share transfer system, are liable to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. In CREST transactions, the tax is calculated and payment made automatically. Deposits of shares into CREST generally will not be subject to stamp duty reserve tax, unless the transfer into CREST is itself for consideration. Until 31 December 2023, the charge to stamp duty reserve tax at 1.5% on the issue of shares (and transfers integral to capital raising) to a depositary receipt issuer or a clearance service was incompatible with European Union law as retained in the UK following the UK's departure from the European Union, and was not imposed by HMRC. If the UK Finance Bill 2023-24 is enacted in the form it stands as at the date hereof, that 1.5% charge will be repealed with retrospective effect from 1 January 2024.\n\n## Taxation - US residents\n\nThe following is a summary, under current law, of the principal UK tax and US federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of shares or American Depositary Shares ('ADSs') by a holder that is a US holder, as defined below, and who is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes.\n\nThe summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary deals only with US holders that hold shares or ADSs as capital assets, and does not address the tax treatment of holders that are subject to special tax rules. These include banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment (including a 'straddle' or 'hedge') comprised of a share or ADS and one or more other positions, and persons that own directly or indirectly 10% or more (by vote or value) of the stock of HSBC Holdings. This discussion is based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, a 'US holder' is a beneficial holder that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a US domestic corporation or otherwise is subject to US federal income taxes on a net income basis in respect thereof.\n\nHolders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares or ADSs in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws.\n\nAny US federal tax advice included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 is for informational purposes only. It was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding US federal tax penalties.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\nCurrently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings. For US tax purposes, a US holder must include cash dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary income on the date that such holder or the ADS depositary receives them, translating dividends paid in UK pounds sterling into US dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend must include in ordinary income the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment date, and the tax basis of those shares will equal such fair market value.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions for positions that are held for less than 61 days, and subject to a foreign corporation being considered a 'qualified foreign corporation' (which includes not being classified for US federal income tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company), certain dividends ('qualified dividends') received by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US taxation at preferential rates.",

        "page_content": "Based on the company's audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, HSBC Holdings does not believe that it was a passive investment company for its 2023 taxable year and does not anticipate becoming a passive foreign investment company in 2024 or the foreseeable future. Accordingly, dividends paid on the shares or ADSs generally should be eligible for qualified dividends treatment.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nGains realised by a US holder on the sale or other disposition of shares or ADSs normally will not be subject to UK taxation unless at the time of the sale or other disposition the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or permanent establishment and the shares or ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade, profession, vocation, branch or agency or permanent establishment. Such gains will be included in income for US tax purposes, and will be long-term capital gains if the shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. A long-term capital gain realised by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US tax at preferential rates.\n\n## Inheritance tax\n\nShares or ADSs held by an individual whose domicile is determined to be the US for the purposes of the United States-United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the 'Estate Tax Treaty') and who is not for such purposes a national of the UK will not, provided any US federal estate or gift tax chargeable has been paid, be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on a lifetime transfer of shares or ADSs except in certain cases where the shares or ADSs (i) are comprised in a settlement (unless, at the time of the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in the US and was not a national of the UK), (ii) are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment of an enterprise, or (iii) pertain to a UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services. In such cases, the Estate Tax Treaty generally provides a credit against US federal tax liability for the amount of any tax paid in the UK in a case where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal estate or gift tax.\n\n## Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax - ADSs\n\nIf shares are transferred to a clearance service or American Depositary Receipt ('ADR') issuer (which will include a transfer of shares to the depositary) UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable unless the UK Finance Bill 2023-24 is enacted in the form it stands as at the date hereof and the transfer is, or is treated as being, in the course of a capital raising arrangement. The stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable on the consideration for the transfer and is payable at the aggregate rate of 1.5%.\n\nThe amount of stamp duty reserve tax payable on such a transfer will be reduced by any stamp duty paid in connection with the same transfer.\n\nNo stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS, provided that the ADR and any separate instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remain at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any such transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS effected by the transfer of an ADR.\n\n## US information reporting and backup withholding tax\n\nDistributions made on shares or ADSs and proceeds from the sale of shares or ADSs that are paid within the US, or through certain financial intermediaries to US holders, are subject to US information reporting and may be subject to a US 'backup' withholding tax. General exceptions to this rule happen when the US holder: establishes that it is a corporation (other than an S corporation) or other exempt holder; or provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Holders that are not US persons (as defined in the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) generally are not subject to US information reporting or\n\nbackup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not US persons in order to avoid the application of such US information reporting requirements or backup withholding tax to payments received within the US or through certain financial intermediaries.\n\n## Approach to ESG reporting\n\nThe information set out in the ESG review on pages 41 to 98, taken together with other information relating to ESG issues included in this Annual Report and Accounts 2023 , aims to provide key ESG information and data relevant to our operations for the year ended 31 December 2023. The data is compiled for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 unless otherwise specified. Measurement techniques and calculations are explained next to data tables where necessary. There are no significant changes from the previous reporting period in terms of scope, boundary or measurement of our reporting of ESG matters. Where relevant, rationale is provided for any restatement of information or data that has been previously published. We have also considered our obligations under the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide contained in Appendix C2 to The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ('ESG Guide') and under LR9.8.6R(8) of the Financial Conduct Authority's ('FCA') Listing Rules. We will continue to develop and refine our reporting and disclosures on ESG matters in line with feedback received from our investors and other stakeholders, and in view of our obligations under the ESG Guide and the FCA's Listing Rules.\n\n## ESG Guide\n\nWe comply with the 'comply or explain' provisions in the ESG Guide, save for certain items, which we describe in more detail below:\n\n- -A1(b) on relevant laws/regulations relating to air and greenhouse gas emissions, discharges into water and land, and generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and on emissions: taking into account the nature of our business, we do not believe that there are relevant laws and regulations in these areas that have significant impacts on our operations. Nevertheless, we are fully compliant with our publication of information regarding scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, while we only partially publish information on scope 3 carbon emissions, as the data required for that publication is not yet fully available.\n- -A1.3 on total hazardous waste produced, A1.4 on total nonhazardous waste produced: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider hazardous waste to be a material issue for our stakeholders. As such, we report only on total waste produced, which includes hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\n- -A1.6 on handling hazardous and non-hazardous waste: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider this to be a material issue for our stakeholders. Notwithstanding this, we continue to focus on the reduction and recycling of all waste. Building on the success of our previous operational environmental strategy, we are continuing to seek to identify key opportunities where we can lessen our wider environmental impact, including waste management. For further details, please see our ESG review on page 63.\n- -A2.4 on sourcing water issue and water efficiency target: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider this to be a material issue for our stakeholders. Notwithstanding this, we have implemented measures to further reduce water consumption through the installation of flow restrictors, auto-taps and low or zero flush sanitary fittings and continue to track our water consumption.\n- -A2.5 on packaging material, B6(b) on issues related to health and safety and labelling relating to products and services provided, B6.1 on percentage of total products sold or shipped subject to recalls for safety and health reasons and B6.4 in recall procedures: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider these to be material issues for our stakeholders.\n\nThis is aligned with the materiality reporting principle that is set out in the ESG Guide. See 'How we decide what to measure' on page 43",

We set targets in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA') guidelines by setting 2030 targets. While the NZBA define 2030 as intermediate, we use different time horizons for climate risk management. We define short term as time periods up to 2025; medium term is between 2026 and 2035; and long term is between 2036 and 2050. In 2023, we disclose interim 2030 financed emissions targets for seven sectors comprising five on-balance sheet and two combined financed emissions targets, as we outline on page 18. For the shipping sector, we have taken a decision not to set a standalone financed emissions target. The decision follows a reduction in our exposure to the sector after the strategic sale of part of our European shipping portfolio. This aligns with NZBA guidelines on sector inclusion for target setting. We have now set combined on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions targets for two emissions-intensive sectors: oil and gas, and power and utilities, and report the combined progress for both sectors. We intend to review the financed emissions baselines and targets annually and restate where relevant, to help ensure that they are aligned with market practice and current climate science. For further details on the restatements and targets and progress of financed emissions, see section 'Our approach to financed emissions recalculations' and 'Targets and Progress' on page 56 and 57.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) relating to capital deployment target: We do not currently disclose a target for capital deployment. In relation to capital deployment, since 2015, we have issued more than $2bn of our own green bonds and structured green bonds with the capital invested into a variety of green projects, including: green buildings, renewable energy and clean transportation projects. In 2023, we further progressed our internal review and enhancement of the green bond framework, with further refinement including internal and external review to be undertaken in 2024. This will be subject to continuous review and monitoring to ensure that they remain up to date and reflect updated standards, taxonomies and best practices. Any such developments in standards, taxonomies and best practices over time could result in revisions in our reporting going forward and lead to differences year-on-year as compared to prior years. See the HSBC Green Bond Report for further information.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) relating to internal carbon pricing target: We do not currently disclose internal carbon pricing target due to transitional challenges such as developing the appropriate systems and processes, but we considered carbon prices as an input for our climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available.\n\n## Impacts on financial planning and performance\n\nStrategy (b) relating to financial planning and performance: We have used climate scenarios to inform our organisation's business, strategy and financial planning. In 2023, we continued to incorporate certain aspects of sustainable finance and financed emissions within our financial planning process. We do not fully disclose impacts from climate-related opportunities on financial planning and performance including on revenue, costs and the balance sheet, quantitative scenario analysis, detailed climate risk exposures for all sectors and geographies or physical risk metrics. This is due to transitional challenges in relation to data limitations, although nascent work is ongoing in these areas. We expect these data limitations to be\n\naddressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented.\n\nStrategy (b) related to transition plan: We published our Group-wide net zero transition plan in January 2024. In this plan, we provided an overview of our approach to net zero and the actions we are taking to help meet our ambitions. We want to be clear about our approach, the change underway today and what we plan to do in the future. We also want to be transparent about where there are still unresolved issues and uncertainties. We are still developing our disclosures, including considerations of possible additional data in relation to our financial plans, budgets, and related financial approach for the implementation of the transition plan in the medium term (e.g. amount of capital and other expenditures supporting our decarbonisation strategy).\n\nMetrics and targets (a) relating to internal carbon prices and climaterelated opportunities metrics: We do not currently disclose internal carbon prices due to transitional challenges such as data challenges. But we considered carbon prices as an input for our climate scenario analysis exercise. In addition, we do not currently fully disclose the proportion of revenue or proportion of assets, capital deployment or other business activities aligned with climate-related opportunities, including revenue from products and services designed for a lowcarbon economy, forward-looking metrics consistent with our business or strategic planning time horizons. In relation to sustainable finance revenue and assets we are disclosing certain elements. We expect the data and system limitations related to financial planning and performance, and climate-related opportunities metrics to be addressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented. We expect to further enhance this disclosure in the medium term.\n\n## Impacts of transition and physical risk\n\nStrategy (c) relating to quantitative scenario analysis: We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies. In 2023, we have disclosed the impairment impacts for our wholesale, retail and commercial real estate portfolios in different climate scenarios. In addition, we have disclosed losses on our retail mortgage book under three scenarios and flood depths for specific markets. For our wholesale book, we have disclosed potential implications on our expected credit losses for 11 sectors under two scenarios. We have also disclosed a heat map showing how we expect the risks to evolve over time.\n\nMetrics and targets (a) relating to detailed climate-related risk exposure metrics for physical and transition risks: We do not fully disclose metrics used to assess the impact of climate-related physical (chronic) and transitions (policy and legal, technology and market) risks on retail lending, parts of wholesale lending and other financial intermediary business activities (specifically credit exposure, equity and debt holdings, or trading positions, each broken down by industry, geography, credit quality and average tenor). We are aiming to develop the appropriate systems, data and processes to provide these disclosures in future years. We disclose the exposure to six high transition risk wholesale sectors and the flood risk exposure and Energy Performance Certificate breakdown for the UK portfolio.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) on targets related to physical risk: We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage physical risk. This is due to transitional challenges including data limitations of physical risk metrics. For retail, we do not use targets to measure and manage physical risk. In 2023 we introduced internally a global 'soft trigger' monitoring and review process for physical risk exposure where a market reaches or exceeds a set threshold, as this ensures markets are actively considering their balance sheet risk exposure to peril events. We also consider physical and transition risk as an input for our climate scenario analysis exercise.\n\nWe expect to further enhance our disclosures as our data, quantitative scenario analysis, risk metrics and physical risk targets evolve, and technology solutions are implemented in the medium term.",

        "page_content": "## Scope 3 emissions disclosure\n\nMetrics and targets (b) relating to scope 3 emissions metrics: We currently disclose partial scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions including business travel, supply chain and financed emissions. We currently disclose four out of 15 categories of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions including business travel, supply chain and financed emissions. In relation to financed emissions, we publish on-balance sheet financed emissions for a number of sectors as detailed on page 18. We also publish facilitated emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. Future disclosures on financed emissions and related risks are reliant on our customers publicly disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, targets and plans, and related risks. We recognise the need to provide early transparency on climate disclosures but balance this with the recognition that existing data and reporting processes require significant enhancements.\n\n## Other matters\n\nStrategy (b) relating to access to capital: We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy and financial planning. Our access to capital may be impacted by reputational concerns as a result of climate action or inaction. In addition, if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero ambitions, we could face reputational damage, impacting our revenue-generating ability and potentially our access to capital markets. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available.\n\nTo manage these risks we have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy, and incorporated it within the risk management framework through the policies and controls for the existing risks where appropriate.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) relating to water usage target: We have described the targets used by the organisation to manage climaterelated risks and opportunities and performance against targets. However, taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider water usage to be a material target for our business and, therefore, we have not included a target in this year's disclosure.\n\nWith respect to our obligations under LR9.8.6R(8) of the FCA's Listing Rules, as part of considering what to measure and publicly report, we perform an assessment to ascertain the appropriate level of detail to be included in the climate-related financial disclosures that are set out in our Annual Report and Accounts . Our assessment takes into account factors such as the level of our exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, the scope and objectives of our climaterelated strategy, transitional challenges, and the nature, size and complexity of our business. See 'How we decide what to measure' on page 43 for further information.\n\n## Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis Annual Report and Accounts 2023 contains certain forwardlooking statements with respect to HSBC's financial condition; results of operations and business, including the strategic priorities; financial, investment and capital targets; and ESG targets, commitments and ambitions described herein.\n\nStatements that are not historical facts, including statements about HSBC's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as 'may', 'will', 'should', 'expects', 'targets', 'anticipates', 'intends', 'plans', 'believes', 'seeks', 'estimates', 'potential' and 'reasonably possible', or the negative thereof, other variations thereon or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, information, data, estimates and projections, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. HSBC makes no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of any forward-looking statements. Written and/or oral forward-looking statements may also be made in the periodic reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, summary financial statements to shareholders, proxy statements, offering circulars and\n\nprospectuses, press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by HSBC's directors, officers or employees to third parties, including financial analysts. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated or implied in any forwardlooking statement. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, such as new, continuing or deepening recessions, prolonged inflationary pressures and fluctuations in employment levels and the creditworthiness of customers beyond those factored into consensus forecasts; the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war and their impact on global economies and the markets where HSBC operates, which could have a material adverse effect on (among other things) our financial condition, results of operations, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit ratings; deviations from the market and economic assumptions that form the basis for our ECL measurements (including, without limitation, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, inflationary pressures, commodity price changes, and ongoing developments in the commercial real estate sector in mainland China); potential changes in HSBC's dividend policy; changes and volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates levels, including the accounting impact resulting from financial reporting in respect of hyperinflationary economies; volatility in equity markets; lack of liquidity in wholesale funding or capital markets, which may affect our ability to meet our obligations under financing facilities or to fund new loans, investments and businesses; geopolitical tensions or diplomatic developments producing social instability or legal uncertainty, such as the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Hamas war (including the continuation and escalation thereof) and the related imposition of sanctions and trade restrictions, supply chain restrictions and disruptions, sustained increases in energy prices and key commodity prices, claims of human rights violations, diplomatic tensions, including between China and the US, the UK, the EU, India and other countries, and developments in Hong Kong and Taiwan, alongside other potential areas of tension, which may adversely affect HSBC by creating regulatory, reputational and market risks; the efficacy of government, customer, and HSBC's actions in managing and mitigating ESG risks, in particular climate risk, nature-related risks and human rights risks, and in supporting the global transition to net zero carbon emissions, each of which can impact HSBC both directly and indirectly through our customers and which may result in potential financial and nonfinancial impacts; illiquidity and downward price pressure in national real estate markets; adverse changes in central banks' policies with respect to the provision of liquidity support to financial markets; heightened market concerns over sovereign creditworthiness in over-indebted countries; adverse changes in the funding status of public or private defined benefit pensions; societal shifts in customer financing and investment needs, including consumer perception as to the continuing availability of credit; exposure to counterparty risk, including third parties using us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge; the discontinuation of certain key Ibors and the transition of the remaining legacy Ibor contracts to near risk-free benchmark rates, which continues to expose HSBC to some financial and nonfinancial risks; and price competition in the market segments we serve;\n- -changes in government policy and regulation, including the monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks and other regulatory authorities in the principal markets in which we operate and the consequences thereof (including, without limitation, actions taken as a result of the impact of the RussiaUkraine war on inflation); initiatives to change the size, scope of activities and interconnectedness of financial institutions in connection with the implementation of stricter regulation of financial institutions in key markets worldwide; revised capital and liquidity benchmarks, which could serve to deleverage bank balance sheets and lower returns available from the current business model and portfolio mix; changes to tax laws and tax rates applicable to HSBC, including the imposition of levies or taxes designed to change business mix and risk appetite; the",

Effective risk management depends on, among other things, our ability through stress testing and other techniques to prepare for events that cannot be captured by the statistical models it uses; our success in addressing operational, legal and regulatory, and litigation challenges; and other risks and uncertainties we identify in 'Top and emerging risks' on pages 140 to 144.\n\nThis Annual Report and Accounts 2023 contains a number of images, graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials which aim to give a high-level overview of certain elements of our disclosures and to improve accessibility for readers. These images, graphics, infographics, text boxes and illustrative case studies and credentials are designed to be read within the context of the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 as a whole.\n\n## Additional cautionary statement regarding ESG data, metrics and forward-looking statements\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts 2023 contains a number of forwardlooking statements (as defined above) with respect to HSBC's ESG targets, commitments, ambitions, climate-related pathways, processes and plans, and the methodologies and scenarios we use, or intend to use, to assess our progress in relation to these ('ESGrelated forward-looking statements').\n\nIn preparing the ESG-related information contained in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 , HSBC has made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions, and the processes and issues involved are complex. We have used ESG (including climate) data, models and methodologies that we consider, as of the date on which they were used, to be appropriate and suitable to understand and assess climate change risk and its impact, to analyse financed emissions - and operational and supply chain emissions, to set ESGrelated targets and to evaluate the classification of sustainable finance and investments. However, these data, models and methodologies are often new, are rapidly evolving and are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. In particular, it is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data and methodologies are also likely to be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess and we expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to change. We also face challenges in relation to our ability to access data on a timely basis, lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available and our ability to collect and process relevant data. Consequently, the ESG-related forward-looking statements and ESG metrics disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts 2023 carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty.\n\nDue to the unpredictable evolution of climate change and its future impact and the uncertainty of future policy and market response to ESG-related issues and the effectiveness of any such response, HSBC may have to re-evaluate its progress towards its ESG ambitions, commitments and targets in the future, update the methodologies it uses or alter its approach to ESG (including climate) analysis and may be required to amend, update and recalculate its ESG disclosures and assessments in the future, as market practice and data quality and availability develop.\n\nNo assurance can be given by or on behalf of HSBC as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained herein. Readers are cautioned that a number of factors, both external and those specific to HSBC, could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases materially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any ESG-related forward-looking statement or metric due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors (including without limitation those referred to below):",

        "page_content": "- -Climate change projection risk: this includes, for example, the evolution of climate change and its impacts, changes in the scientific assessment of climate change impacts, transition pathways and future risk exposure and limitations of climate scenario forecasts;\n- -ESG projection risk: ESG metrics are complex and are still subject to development. In addition, the scenarios employed in relation to them, and the models that analyse them have limitations that are sensitive to key assumptions and parameters, which are themselves subject to some uncertainty, and cannot fully capture all of the potential effects of climate, policy and technology-driven outcomes;\n- -Changes in the ESG regulatory landscape: this involves changes in government approach and regulatory treatment in relation to ESG disclosures and reporting requirements, and the current lack of a single standardised regulatory approach to ESG across all sectors and markets;\n- -Variation in reporting standards: ESG reporting standards are still developing and are not standardised or comparable across all sectors and markets, new reporting standards in relation to different ESG metrics are still emerging;\n- -Data availability, accuracy, verifiability and data gaps: our disclosures are limited by the availability of high quality data in some areas and our own ability to timely collect and process such data as required. Where data is not available for all sectors or consistently year on year, there may be an impact to our data quality scores. While we expect our data quality scores to improve over time, as companies continue to expand their disclosures to meet growing regulatory and stakeholder expectations, there may be unexpected fluctuations within sectors year on year, and/or differences between the data quality scores between sectors. Any such changes in the availability and quality of data over time, or our ability to collect and process such data, could result in revisions to reported data going forward, including on financed emissions, meaning that such data may not be reconcilable or comparable year-on year;\n- -Developing methodologies and scenarios: the methodologies and scenarios HSBC uses to assess financed emissions and set ESGrelated targets may develop over time in line with market practice, regulation and/or developments in science, where applicable. Such developments could result in revisions to reported data, including on financed emissions or the classification of sustainable finance and investments, meaning that data outputs may not be reconcilable or comparable year-on year; and\n- -Risk management capabilities: global actions, including HSBC's own actions, may not be effective in transitioning to net zero and in managing relevant ESG risks, including in particular climate, nature-related and human rights risks, each of which can impact HSBC both directly and indirectly through our customers, and which may result in potential financial and non-financial impacts to HBSC. In particular:\n- -we may not be able to achieve our ESG targets, commitments and ambitions (including with respect to the positions set forth in our thermal coal phase-out policy and our energy policy, and our targets to reduce our on-balance sheet financed emissions and, where applicable, facilitated emissions in our portfolio of selected high-emitting sectors), which may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our strategic priorities; and\n- -we may not be able to develop sustainable finance and ESGrelated products consistent with the evolving expectations of our regulators, and our capacity to measure the environmental and social impacts from our financing activity may diminish (including as a result of data and model limitations and changes in methodologies), which may affect our ability to achieve our ESG targets, commitments and ambitions, including our net zero ambition, our targets to reduce our on-balance sheet financed emissions and, where applicable, facilitated emissions in our portfolio of selected high-emitting sectors and the positions set forth in our thermal coal phase-out policy and energy policy, and increase the risk of greenwashing.\n\nAny forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of HSBC speak only as of the date they are made. HSBC expressly disclaims any obligation to revise or update these ESG forward-looking statements, other than as expressly required by applicable law.\n\nWritten and/or oral ESG-related forward-looking statements may also be made in our periodic reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, summary financial statements to shareholders, proxy statements, offering circulars and prospectuses, press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by HSBC's Directors, officers or employees to third parties, including financial analysts.\n\nOur data dictionaries and methodologies for preparing the above ESGrelated metrics and third-party limited assurance reports can be found on: www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/esgreporting-centre.\n\n## Certain defined terms\n\nUnless the context requires otherwise, 'HSBC Holdings' means HSBC Holdings plc and 'HSBC', the 'Group', 'we', 'us' and 'our' refer to HSBC Holdings together with its subsidiaries. Within this document the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is referred to as 'Hong Kong'.\n\nWhen used in the terms 'shareholders' equity' and 'total shareholders' equity', 'shareholders' means holders of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares and those preference shares and capital securities issued by HSBC Holdings classified as equity.
