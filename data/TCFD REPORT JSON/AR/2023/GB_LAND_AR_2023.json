FOCUS ON DRIVING GROWTH\n\nOver the last three years, our focus has been two-fold: /firstly, on increasing our investments in best-in-class assets where our competitive advantages can drive long-term growth, and secondly on preserving balance sheet strength. The success of this is re/flected in our continued like-for-like income growth and rising occupancy, signi/ficantly outperforming market averages. And despite the adjustment in property values over the past two years following the sharp rise in global interest rates, our proactive capital recycling means that pro-forma for our recent hotels disposal, our 32.3% LTV is now lower than it was two years ago, and our net debt is down \u00a31.1bn, creating balance sheet capacity to grow.\n\nOwning the right real estate has never been more important, as the normalisation in cost of capital means value drivers in real estate have fundamentally changed compared to much of the 2010s decade, when ultra-cheap money and sector themes were key drivers of performance. Irrespective of sector, there is now a growing distinction between those assets that really ful/fil customers' future expectations and hence deliver like-for-like income growth and those that do not. This means future performance across the entire sector will be much more driven by asset quality than generic themes.\n\nThe successful execution of our strategy over the last few years means Landsec is well positioned in this context. Customer demand for our high-quality product has remained robust despite the unsettled political/economic backdrop, concerns about hybrid working and cost of living pressures for consumers.\n\n'After a period of proactive asset recycling, we have meaningful capacity to reinvest proceeds in acquiring high-quality assets at an attractive point in the cycle.'\n\nMARK ALLAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\nIn London, our \u00a36.2bn West End-focused portfolio is almost full, with occupancy up to 97.3%, so rents are rising. In retail, our \u00a31.8bn portfolio of nine major destinations has seen occupancy rise to 95.4% and we have started to drive positive reversionary uplifts on lettings and renewals. As a result, our like-for-like net rental income increased by 2.8% last year and, following a period of interest rate-driven asset repricing, the valuation of c. 60% of our portfolio was e/ffectively stable in the second half of last year.\n\nLooking forward, we expect high demand for best-in-class space to persist and, as supply of this space remains limited, this will continue to drive like-for-like income growth. Meanwhile, as the interest rate outlook today appears more balanced than at any point in the last couple of years, yields and values for the best assets are starting to stabilise. Having sold early when values were higher,",

As a result, Landsec is well-placed for growth.\n\n## CONTINUED STRENGTH IN OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\n\nOur /financial results re/flect the quality of our portfolio, the strong operational performance of our platform and our resilient capital base. Our FY23 earnings included the bene/fit of a \u00a322m increase in surrender premiums, which we adjusted for in our 50.1 pence underlying EPRA EPS. Our EPRA EPS last year was stable vs this underlying level, in line with our guidance, as the 2.8% growth in like-for-like income we delivered, and the completion of our successful developments fully o/ffset the impact of our signi/ficant disposals during the past two years and a rise in /finance costs.\n\nOur dividend for the year is up 2.6% to 39.6 pence per share, again in line with our guidance, re/flecting a healthy dividend cover of 1.27 times.\n\nDuring the /first half of the year, the marked rise in interest rates across the globe resulted in upwards pressure on valuation yields, but this eased in the second half and throughout the year the impact of this has been partly o/ffset by our 3.2% ERV growth. This meant that our portfolio value was down 6.0%, or \u00a3625m, for the year, driving a \u00a3341m loss and an 8.2% reduction in EPRA NTA per share for the year. However, the impact of this was weighted towards the /first half, as yields remained stable in the /final quarter and our total return on equity for the year improved to -4.0% from -8.3% in the prior year.\n\n| HIGHLIGHTS                                                          | Mar 2024   | Mar 2023   | TABLE 1 Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------------|\n| EPRA earnings (\u00a3m) 1,2                                              | 371        | 393        | (5.6)              |\n| Loss before tax (\u00a3m)                                                | (341)      | (622)      | (45.2)             |\n| Total return on equity (%)                                          | (4.0)      | (8.3)      | (51.8)             |\n| Basic loss per share (pence)                                        | (43.0)     | (83.6)     | (48.6)             |\n| EPRA earnings per share (pence) 1,2                                 | 50.1       | 53.1       | (5.6)              |\n| Underlying EPRA earnings per share (pence) 1,2                      | 50.1       | 50.1       | -                  |\n| Dividend per share (pence)                                          | 39.6       | 38.6       | 2.6                |\n| Combined portfolio (\u00a3m) 1                                           | 9,963      | 10,239     | (2.7)              |\n| IFRS net assets (\u00a3m)                                                | 6,447      | 7,072      | (8.8)              |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share (pence) 1                        | 859        | 936        | (8.2)              |\n| Adjusted net debt (\u00a3m) 1                                            | 3,517      | 3,287      | 7.0                |\n| Group LTV ratio (%) 1                                               | 35.0       | 31.7       | 10.4               |\n| Proportion of portfolio rated EPC A-B (%)                           | 49         | 36         |                    |\n| Average upfront embodied carbon reduction  development pipeline (%) | 40         | 36         |                    |\n| Energy intensity reduction vs 2020 (%)                              | 18         | 17         |                    |\n\n- 1.

FY23 EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS include the bene/fit of \u00a322m increase in surrender premiums; underlying EPRA EPS excludes this.\n\n## OUR STRATEGY\n\nSince we launched our strategy in late 2020, our focus has consistently been on our two key principles of sustainable value creation: focusing our resources on where we have a genuine competitive advantage and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have increased our investment in best-in-class assets where our skillset allows us to enhance returns and drive long-term growth. This has supported our like-for-like income growth and operational outperformance thus far and should continue to do so in the future. At the same time, our proactive capital recycling\n\nmeans that, despite the rise in interest rates and adjustment in property values, pro-forma for our recent disposals, our 32.3% LTV and 7.0x net debt/EBITDA are low.\n\nFor much of the decade leading up to 2022, creating value in real estate was often about leveraging up a spread between rental yields and ultra-low borrowing costs or picking high-level sector themes. The signi/ficant rise in cost of capital across the globe has not only changed the former but also the latter, as shown by the challenges faced by low-margin online retail models and the shift\n\nback to physical retail. As such, irrespective of sector, quality has become a much more important driver of future performance, which means it can be misleading to look at market averages. Indeed, even though market-wide vacancy is elevated, with London o/ffices at 8.8%, retail at 15% and even logistics at 7.8% now, the best assets in each of these sectors have little vacancy and so continue to show good rental growth.\n\nThe successful execution of our strategy means we are well placed to bene/fit from this. Since late 2020, we have sold around 40 standalone assets, including the 21 hotels we sold since the year-end. We reinvested principally in our key places, be it through development in Victoria, at Piccadilly Lights and in Southwark, or by buying out JV partners in our retail destinations at Bluewater and in Cardi/ff, such that c. 80% of our portfolio is now invested in twelve key locations with signi/ficant scarcity value. We expect each of these unique, multi-let places to drive superior income returns and growth over time.\n\nThis provides a critical underpin for capital values. The outlook for interest rates is more balanced now than it has been for a couple of years, but we remain of the view that it is unlikely that rates will come down sharply from current levels. In what will therefore likely remain a higher nominal rate environment, we think yields for assets which have inherent income growth and therefore provide a real income stream look attractive, yet for most assets which lack this growth, we think the risk to values remains down.\n\nIn today's more normalised rate environment, we continue to target to deliver a total return on equity of 8-10% p.a. over time, comprising a mix of income and capital returns, driven by rental growth and selective development upside. Short-term movements in valuation yields are outside of our control and mean our return on equity will not be exactly in this range each individual year, as we have seen over the past twelve months. However, with an income return on our March 2024 NTA of c. 5.7%, an expectation of further rental growth and yields starting to stabilise, the outlook for this is encouraging.\n\nAs part of this, it is important that we operate e/fficiently. We reduced our overhead costs by 9% during the year and expect further savings over the next 2-3 years, driven partly by our investments in data and technology. Although our EPRA cost ratio has remained stable at 25%, this solely re/flects the impact of capital allocation decisions: since late 2020, we have sold \u00a32.2bn of",

Including our \u00a3400m of disposals since the year-end, we have now sold \u00a33.1bn of assets since late 2020, which means most of the c. \u00a34bn disposal target we set out at that time is done. Looking ahead, we have three principal opportunities to invest in: acquiring major retail; our Central London pipeline; and our mixed-use pipeline. We also have three main sources of funding: our balance sheet headroom towards a slightly higher LTV now that rates and values are starting to stabilise; further capital recycling; or attracting other, complementary sources of capital which can enhance our overall growth, capitalise on our platform value, and grow our overall return on equity.\n\nIn terms of opportunities, the right major retail destinations o/ffer attractive high single digit income returns with income now starting to grow, as seen across our own portfolio. Alongside our two committed o/ffice developments in London, where the yield on the overall capex we are investing is high at c. 12%, this is our key focus for investment at the moment and where we plan to apply most of our existing balance sheet capacity too. Following a period of limited transaction activity in this sector, we are now seeing signs of activity levels around the work-out of broken ownership structures starting to pick up. Further capital recycling out of our residual retail parks will add to our investment capacity in this space and, overall, this is expected to enhance our income growth and return on equity.\n\nGiven the signi/ficant size of our medium-term London and mixed-use pipelines and our desire to maintain a sustainable level of development exposure, it is unlikely that we will fund all of this on our own balance sheet. Rents for highly sustainable, best-in-class space continue to grow and construction cost in/flation has normalised, yet returns on future commitments will of course have to\n\ncompensate for higher cost and higher exit yields. We continue to optimise costs, planning consents and delivery programmes in London and mixed-use to ensure any future commitments deliver an appropriate return and risk premium vs the return on any assets we choose to sell to fund our investment in these. We will progress the schemes that deliver this, adjust plans for others, or sell those where the holding cost of maintaining optionality does not outweigh the future upside. Overall, this will enhance our overall return on equity through development upside and longer-term rental growth, re/flecting the quality of our pipeline.\n\n## CREATING VALUE THROUGH OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES\n\nIn executing our strategy, we continue to focus on our three key competitive advantages: our high quality portfolio; the strength of our customer relationships; and our ability to unlock complex opportunities. Customer demand continues to polarise, as demand for modern, sustainable space in areas with exciting amenities in London remains strong, even though overall leasing across the market was down during the year. In retail, brands continue to focus on fewer, but bigger and better stores in key locations. Supply of both is constrained, which is driving income and rental value growth across our assets.\n\nIn London, 77% of our portfolio is now located in the vibrant West End and Southwark markets, up from 58% in 2020. Our recently completed schemes are 89%\n\nlet or in solicitors' hands, up from 60% a year ago, with rents 12% above initial expectations. O/ffice utilisation is up 18% for the year and 81% of our lettings over the year have seen customers grow or keep the same space. Across our existing portfolio we signed or are in solicitors' hands on \u00a335m of leases, on average 6% above ERV, whilst occupancy is up 140bps to 97.3%. With 15% uplifts on relettings/renewals, our o/ffices saw 1.4% LFL rental income growth and overall ERVs were up 5.0%, at the top end of our guidance of low to mid single digit growth.\n\nAcross our major retail destinations, we completed or are in solicitors' hands on \u00a337m of lettings, on average 6% above ERV. Re/flecting the marked turnaround of the best assets in this space, we have started to capture positive reversionary potential during the year, with relettings and renewals on average 2% above previous passing rent, whilst occupancy increased by a further 130bps to 95.4%. Combined with strong turnover growth, this meant we delivered 6.9% growth in LFL net rental income. Valuers' assumed ERVs continue to trail operational performance, up 1.4%, albeit in line with our guided range.\n\nOur strong operational performance is supplemented by our ability to unlock complex opportunities, such as in London, where we completed three projects over live Underground stations featuring highly bespoke engineering solutions, combined creating c. \u00a3238m of value, or in mixed-use,",

This ability is expected to serve us well when it comes to new opportunities in the year ahead.\n\n## DELIVERING SUSTAINABLY\n\nWe continue to make progress against our carbon reduction targets, which are aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. Our near-term target is to reduce our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline and to reach net zero by 2040 from the same baseline year. So far, emissions have already reduced by 24% vs this baseline. During the year we updated our target to reduce our energy intensity by 52% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline, to align this with our carbon reduction target. We are already tracking an 18% reduction, having achieved an energy intensity reduction across our portfolio of 3.7% during the year vs the prior year.\n\nTo make sure we meet our carbon reduction target and stay ahead of the proposed Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard Regulations requiring a minimum EPC 'B' rating by 2030, we have continued to progress our Net Zero Transition Investment Plan. 49% of our overall portfolio is already rated B or higher, up from 36% a year ago. We have started air source heat pump retro/fits at two sites and expect to start a further three this year, which will result in improved EPC ratings from 2025 onwards when these become operational. We also continue to focus on reducing upfront embodied carbon from our development schemes and improving energy e/fficiency across our operational assets, and have been expanding the work with our largest customers to help them identify ways to save energy.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, our actions over the past three years leave us well placed:\n\n- \u00b7 we increased our focus on high-quality places where customer demand is demonstrably strong;\n- \u00b7 we preserved our balance sheet strength, providing room to grow at an attractive time in the cycle;\n- \u00b7 we have a built pipeline of attractive opportunities with /flexibility on future commitments.\n\nAs customer demand for the best space remains robust, we expect our Central London and major retail assets to again see ERVs grow by a low to mid single digit percentage this year. We are now capturing positive leasing reversion across all main parts of our portfolio, which delivered 2.8% growth in like-for-like net rental income last year, and we expect like-for-like growth to be similar for the year ahead.\n\nDetermining how this continued operational growth will then translate into EPS growth will depend on the quantum and timing of net investment from here, where we remain disciplined on quality and price. We have created meaningful balance sheet capacity through our signi/ficant asset disposals but our recent sales activity does reduce annualised earnings by c. 4%, all else equal. This means that, before re/flecting the impact of any reinvestment of these sales proceeds, EPS for the year to March 2025 would likely be slightly below the 50.1 pence for 2024. For March 2026, we currently expect EPS to be slightly above this level, re/flecting the combined e/ffect of continued like-for-like income growth and accretive capital recycling. As a result, we continue to expect our dividend to grow by a low single digit percentage this year, as our dividend cover remains towards the high end of our 1.2-1.3x target range.\n\nAs macro-economic signals look more encouraging than they have for a while, with long-term interest rates stabilising and customer demand for the best assets remaining robust, the outlook for capital values of the best assets and, as a result, our overall return on equity is positive. With capacity to grow at an attractive point in time, we are positive about the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMARK ALLAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\nIn its /first year, our Landsec Futures fund, which is aimed at improving social mobility in the real estate industry and will see us invest \u00a320m over 2023-2033, has already made a signi/ficant contribution to our target to create \u00a3200m in social value and empower 30,000 people towards the world of work by 2030. Since 2019/20, we have now created \u00a354m of social value and empowered 10,249 people to work.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nThe UK macro outlook has improved over the past year, with a sharp reduction in in/flation and a return to real wage growth for consumers, even though economic growth is expected to remain modest in the short term. Combined with the more normalised interest rate environment, this means it has never been more important to own the very best assets in the right locations that cater for customers' future needs and can therefore deliver positive like-for-like income growth.\n\nIn late 2022, we said that we expected property values would continue to adjust for some time after a decade of ultra-low interest rates. This has proven to be the case but there are increasingly signs that this is now coming to an end. The relative stabilisation of long-term rates is a clear positive and re/flecting the historically attractive pricing of good quality income in London and major retail, we are starting to see interest emerge from investors who have not been active in these markets for some time. As such, we expect activity levels to pick up from here. The re/financing of cheap debt issued before 2022 remains a challenge for parts of the sector, yet absent any further macro shocks, we think the value of highquality assets has largely bottomed out and will start to grow in the foreseeable future as rents rise.",

We own high-quality o/ffices in London, six regional shopping centres, three retail outlet centres and a portfolio of mixed-use urban development opportunities in London, Manchester and Glasgow. In all of these markets, asset quality is key, and the way we shape, curate and sustain these places has never been more important that it is today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CENTRAL LONDON OFFICES\n\nThe central London o/ffice market is adapting as businesses and employees establish the most appropriate ways of working in a post-pandemic world. Inevitably, /flexible working practices will reduce the overall demand for o/ffice space, but the impact will be mostly in large HQ buildings and locations lacking the right amenities. Demand for the best space has proven to be resilient as businesses look to provide a high-quality environment to attract and retain their talent.\n\nThe best o/ffice space has the following three characteristics:\n\n- ' A GREAT LOCATION - CLOSE PROXIMITY TO TRANSPORT HUBS, PARTICULARLY OVERGROUND TRAIN STATIONS\n- ' A VIBRANT MIX OF LOCAL AMENITIES - INCLUDING FOOD, BEVERAGE, RETAIL AND LEISURE FACILITIES TOGETHER WITH GREEN SPACE\n- ' COMPELLING SUSTAINABILITY CHARACTERISTICS - FROM NET ZERO CONSTRUCTION TO MINIMISING OPERATIONAL CARBON EMISSIONS\n\nThe quality and location of o/ffice buildings is now critical in driving occupier demand. Research undertaken by JLL for Landsec in 2024 showed that almost 40% of all vacant space in central London o/ffices resided in just 1% of buildings and 90% of vacant space was in 10% of buildings. 86% of central London o/ffices had no material vacancies at all. The investment market remained subdued due to the rapid rise in interest rates.\n\nTransaction volumes in the year to March 24 were just \u00a34.6bn, 64% below the ten-year average. As a result, prime yields softened by 125bps in the City and 25bps in the West End and have now increased by 200bps and 75bps respectively since June 2022. The stark di/fference in the strength of the occupational and investment markets has resulted in an unprecedented market position - asset values have seen a material re-pricing (down 25% since August 2022) but rental values have continued to grow and have hit record levels in most of the sub-markets of Central London.\n\n## MAJOR RETAIL DESTINATIONS\n\nAs consumers continue to shift back from online to physical sales, the best retail space in the UK is thriving. There is clear consumer demand for shopping centres with an attractive mix of retail, leisure, and hospitality, but all these elements must be present for shopping centres to thrive. And brand partners with omnichannel strategies are looking for the right space to support their online businesses.\n\nDespite signi/ficant pressures on consumers' disposable income over the last year, retailer sales in the best locations have remained resilient. Retail sales in our portfolio were up 4.1% and footfall rose by 3.9%. Brand partners are increasingly focused on 'fewer, bigger, better' stores in the best locations in order to provide the best customer service and o/ffer to their customers. As a result, demand for space in our shopping centres has been strong and our occupancy levels are now at pre-Covid levels. This demand has also bene/fited rental income: the rental levels we have achieved in our letting activity this year have been above both market levels and the previous passing rent.\n\nTransactions in the shopping centre investment market remain subdued due to the higher interest rate environment a/ffecting most property sectors. However, shopping centre property values have been broadly stable. The combination of a high income return and strong operational performance make this sector an attractive investment opportunity.",

We strive to create, curate, and activate places that inspire people, generating value for all our stakeholders.\n\nThe environment we operate in has changed markedly since we launched our strategy over three years ago, yet our strategy remains the right one. That strategy is underpinned by two key principles of sustainable value creation: focusing our resources on where we have genuine competitive advantage and preserving a strong balance sheet. To achieve this strategy, we need a clear sense of purpose and a culture that supports, respects, and motivates our people. The three - strategy, purpose, culture - are inextricably linked.\n\nIn executing our strategy, we continue to be led by three things: working sustainably, meeting the needs of our customers, and being disciplined with our capital. It is vital we make healthy, sustainable returns to enable our business to grow over time.\n\nWe are a total-return business, and we continue to target a return on equity of 8-10% p.a. over time, comprising a mix of income and capital returns, driven by rental growth and selective development upside. Inevitably, short-term valuation movements,\n\n## LANDSEC STRATEGY\n\nTwo key principles of sustainable value creation.\n\nthat are outside of our control, may adversely a/ffect our returns in the short term, but our current income return on NTA of c. 5.7% and the prospect of stabilising yields means the outlook is encouraging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## FOCUS ON COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE\n\n- ' HIGH-QUALITY PORTFOLIO\n- ' STRONG CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ' UNLOCKING COMPLEX OPPORTUNITIES\n\nPRESERVING BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH\n\n- ' DISCIPLINED CAPITAL RECYCLING\n- ' MANAGING LTV\n- ' PRESERVING OPTIONALITY",

Positively, in/flation has come down markedly from its highs in 2023, but interest rates are likely to fall more slowly.\n\nImportantly, the strategy we set out in late 2020 was not based on a continuing low-rate environment, and we have delivered on this strategy. We have now sold \u00a33.1bn of the c. \u00a34bn assets we identi/fied for sale. This enables us to focus this year on investing in higher-return acquisition opportunities in major retail and selective development opportunities within our business.\n\nIn London, we will likely balance any potential opportunities to invest more in our key clusters with recycling capital out of mature or standalone assets. We will always apply our judgement and expertise in assessing the timing and nature of developments to ensure we maximise the value from our capital investments.\n\n## RETAIL\n\nWe own and operate some of the UK's most renowned retail and hospitality destinations that connect brands with people and partners to create brilliant experiences for customers.\n\nCreating value for people through places\n\nOur strategic focus is on sustainable value creation in three key areas, central London o/ffices, major retail destinations and mixeduse urban neighbourhoods. Customer demand in each area remains resilient, underpinned by the strength of our customer relationships and high-quality portfolio.\n\nThe built environment accounts for 40% of carbon emissions globally, so everything we do needs to have sustainability at its heart. This year, in line with our updated carbon reduction targets, we have continued to execute on our Net Zero Transition Investment Plan reducing operational emissions alongside driving down upfront embodied carbon from our development pipeline ensuring our actions align with the latest climate science. To recognise real estate's role in, and respond to, the growing biodiversity crisis and to maintain our position as a leading sustainable business, we also launched our /first nature strategy. We also launched our principal community investment programme, Landsec Futures, committing to invest \u00a320m over the next decade to enhance social mobility in our workplace and wider industry.\n\n## MIXED-USE URBAN\n\nWorking closely with communities and local authorities around the UK, we regenerate urban spaces into thriving places to live, work and play.\n\nAt the heart of our philosophy is a belief that we can only be successful if our customers are successful. We look to build positive and lasting relationships with them, to understand their businesses better, and determine what we can do better or di/fferently to help them succeed.\n\nWe think constantly and very carefully about where to invest, focusing in particular on projected returns and the associated risks. With visibility and expertise across three distinct focus areas, we have a unique perspective on relative risk and returns, which enables us to be clear and decisive in our capital allocation decisions.\n\nIt has never been more important to own the very best assets in the right locations that cater for customers' future needs. Our portfolio is built on high-quality places with real scarcity value. Through the careful curation and stewardship of these places, they can deliver positive like-for-like income growth. In addition, the best quality assets with rental growth look attractive in a higher cost of capital world, and we are already seeing increasing investor interest for assets with these characteristics. In contrast, secondary asset values will almost certainly have further to fall.",

Since the year-end we have sold our hotel portfolio for \u00a3400m, slightly ahead of the March 2023 book value. This crystallised the strong recovery in performance post Covid yet as the income on this portfolio was 100% turnover linked on long-term leases to Accor, there was no opportunity for us to in/fluence or enhance its future operational performance.\n\nDuring the year we made \u00a3136m of acquisitions and spent \u00a3220m on development capex. We acquired an 89,000 sq ft o/ffice in Kings Cross for \u00a390m which we plan to reposition to Myo for an opening in 2025, with an expected IRR in the mid-teens. In addition, we bought a \u00a330m site adjacent to our Timber Square development for an implied price of c. \u00a3100 per sq ft. This could almost double the size of the combined site and create a signi/ficant c. 670,000 sq ft estate across four buildings. We also spent \u00a316m on a small number of site amalgamation opportunities adjacent to existing assets. Whilst these acquisitions do not produce income in the short term and therefore create a c. \u00a36m earnings drag in the current year because of /finance costs, they unlock substantial near-term upside potential at a low in-price.\n\nWith the sale of our hotel portfolio, we have now sold \u00a33.1bn of the c. \u00a34bn assets we said we intended to sell over a period of c. 6 years when we launched our updated strategy in late 2020. We will continue to recycle capital where assets do not meet our return requirements or /fit our strategic focus, but this means we are now through the vast majority of our disposal programme. As such, our focus for the rest of the year is now on acquisitions, as we aim to recycle the proceeds of our hotels disposal into additional opportunities in major retail. In London and\n\nmixed-use, our own investment in new development commitments is likely to be funded principally through future disposals of mature or standalone assets, alongside other, complementary sources of capital.\n\n## PORTFOLIO VALUATION\n\nThe marked increase in interest rates during the /first half of the year meant that transaction activity across global property markets has been subdued. As a result, valuation yields softened so despite the fact that our successful leasing delivered 3.2% ERV growth, our portfolio value reduced by 6.0%. The impact of rising rates principally a/ffected the /first half of the year, as yields remained /flat in the /final quarter and c. 60% of our portfolio was e/ffectively stable in value in the second half.\n\nOur Central London portfolio was down 6.9% for the year, as upside from 5.0% ERV growth was o/ffset by a 46bps increase in yields to 5.4%. The value of our West End o/ffice (-3.6%) and retail and other assets (-4.7%), which make up 77% of our London investment portfolio following our signi/ficant City disposals over the last three years, again proved more resilient than City values (-13.9%). This re/flects strong ERV growth, driven by our successful leasing in Victoria, which means West End o/ffice values were stable in the second half. Development values were down 9.9% given the early stage these projects are in, but we are con/fident these will deliver attractive returns once these are completed and let.\n\nMajor retail valuations were virtually stable for the year, down just 1.1%, following a minor increase in the second half (+0.2%), re/flecting their high income return and improving operational performance, with LFL net income up 6.9%. Valuers' assumed ERVs continue to trail operational performance and leasing, up just 1.4%, but despite this, major retail again was the best performing part of our core portfolio with a 7.1% total return over the year, ahead of Central London (-2.9%) and mixed-use (-8.9%).",

The value of our leisure assets was down\n\n8.2% as investor sentiment towards cinemas remains subdued, even though our largest leisure customer, Cineworld, successfully recapitalised during the year and operational performance and ERV growth remains positive.\n\n| VALUATION ANALYSIS       | Market  value  31 March  2024 \u00a3m   | (De/ficit)/ Surplus \u00a3m   | FY   valuation  change %   | H2 valuation  change  %   | LFL rental value  change 1 %   | Net initial  yield %   | Topped up  net initial  yield %   |   Equivalent  yield % | TABLE 2 LFL  equivalent  yield  change bps   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| West End o/ffices        | 3,109                              | (111)                    | (3.6)                      | (0.5)                     | 6.9                            | 4.2                    | 5.5                               |                   5.3 | 37                                           |\n| City o/ffices            | 1,192                              | (188)                    | (13.9)                     | (4.6)                     | 1.3                            | 3.9                    | 5.4                               |                   6   | 78                                           |\n| Retail and other         | 991                                | (48)                     | (4.7)                      | (3.3)                     | 5.0                            | 4.6                    | 4.8                               |                   4.9 | 30                                           |\n| Developments             | 926                                | (102)                    | (9.9)                      | (4.1)                     | n/a                            | 0.0                    | 0.1                               |                   5.4 | n/a                                          |\n| Total Central London     | 6,218                              | (449)                    | (6.9)                      | (2.4)                     | 5.0                            | 4.2 2                  | 5.3 2                             |                   5.4 | 46                                           |\n| Shopping centres         | 1,226                              | 1                        | 0.1                        | -

Rental value change excludes units materially altered during the period.\n- 2. Excluding developments/land.\n- 3. Previous Mixed-use urban sub-segments have been changed to a classi/fication based on geographical location, which is better aligned to how these assets are managed internally and our revised approach to a number of assets.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect that the relative stability in long-term rates and improvement in availability and pricing of credit will support a pick-up in investment activity. We are seeing investor interest emerge in London and shopping centres from parties who have not been active in these markets for years, but who are now attracted by historically attractive yields and clear evidence of rental growth for best-in-class assets. The re/financing of cheap debt issued pre-2022 remains a challenge for parts of the sector, yet the risk of disorderly sales substantially driving down the value of high-quality assets seems low. Markets remain sensitive to rates, yet values for the best assets have begun to stabilise, even though secondary likely has further to fall. Whilst we are principally focused on driving like-for-like income, we expect ERVs for our London and major retail assets to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage this year.\n\n## LEASING AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE CENTRAL LONDON\n\nCustomer demand remains /firmly focused on buildings with the best sustainability credentials, transport connectivity and local amenities. The amount of space which meets these criteria remains limited, so pricing of this continues to go up, whereas space which does not meet these criteria is at risk of becoming obsolete, almost regardless of price. We continue to see the evidence of this strong demand across our portfolio, for example in the new record rents we achieved in Victoria.\n\nRe/flecting the appeal of our buildings and locations to people, we have seen an increase in daily turnstile tap-ins of 18%, signi/ficantly ahead of the growth in TFL public transport data. Across our leasing deals, we have also seen customers plan for, on average, c. 30% more square foot per\n\nperson than they did before the pandemic in 2019, to create more space for collaboration, focus work or wellbeing. As such, of our \u00a340m of o/ffice lettings over the past year, 47% saw customers increasing /floor space, whilst only 19% re/flected customers downsizing. This is in line with market data which shows that only one-/fifth of active tenant requirements is for less space.\n\nWe have consistently said that we felt that large HQ space and areas which lack the amenities to make people want to spend time there are most at risk as a result of more /flexible ways of working. Virtually all of the \u00a32.2bn o/ffices we sold since late 2020 were large, single-let HQ buildings where our ability to add further value was limited, whilst we increased our focus on multi-let clusters in the lively, well-connected West End and Southbank markets. These now make up 77% of our London portfolio vs 58% in 2020.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn a world where demand is concentrated in the best part of the market, market averages become rather meaningless. This is illustrated by the fact that, whereas overall o/ffice vacancy in London is elevated, at 8.8%, 90% of all vacant space sits in 10% of all buildings and close to 40% of vacant space sits in just 1% of all o/ffices in London. This shows vacancy is mostly a building issue, not a market-wide issue. It also shows o/ffices are di/fferent than retail 5+ years ago, as in retail even the best locations saw vacancy rise and, as a result, rents fall, whereas in o/ffices Grade A availability remains low, so rents continue to rise.\n\nEven though take-up across the overall London market slowed, demand for space across our standing portfolio remained resilient. We signed lettings during the year totalling \u00a330m of rent, on average 5% above valuers' assumptions, with a further \u00a35m in solicitors' hands, 9% above valuers' estimates. Overall, relettings and renewals re/flected a 15% uplift vs previous passing rent and occupancy increased 140bps to 97.3% substantially outperforming the Central London market, where occupancy fell by 100bps. Our two existing Myo locations saw average occupancy for the year rise to 93%, up from 86%.\n\n## MAJOR RETAIL DESTINATIONS\n\nWe have continued to see a further shift back from online to physical sales, with negative online non-food sales growth for the last two years. The exact split between online and o/ffline is becoming less of a factor for the best locations as for most major brands online and physical channels are /firmly interconnected. The increase in cost of capital and cost of doing business online is keeping pressure on low-margin online sales. This principally a/ffects pure-play online models, which in response have shifted their focus to improving pro/fitability rather than growing market share, increasing the cost for consumers to buy online.\n\nRe/flecting this, we continue to see growing demand from brands for physical space in the best locations. There is a clear focus on 'fewer, bigger, better' stores, as leading brands such as Inditex and H&M have announced signi/ficant investments in their best stores, even though they often continue to close the tail ends of their portfolio. Supported by the fact that for many key brands, including JD, Zara, Boots and Next sales growth in our centres is outperforming their overall sales growth, this explains the strong demand for our space. Across our portfolio, total sales grew 4.1% and like-for-like sales were up 1.5%.\n\naverage 5% ahead of valuers' assumptions plus a further \u00a33m in solicitors' hands at a 3% premium, whilst occupancy was up 30bps to 98.0%. We agreed a restructure of a number of leases with Cineworld following its recapitalisation during the /first half resulting in an annual rent reduction of less than \u00a31m, but all our units continue to trade. Our hotels, which are fully let to Accor, saw occupancy rise from 94% to 98% of pre-Covid levels, driving an increase in RevPAR, which supported our disposal post the year-end.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE CENTRAL LONDON\n\nWe continue to see good demand for the high-quality space we develop. During the year, we completed our n2 development in Victoria and Lucent behind Piccadilly Lights, both of which were e/ffectively fully let within four months post completion, with rents on average 14% ahead of initial assumptions. At The Forge in Southwark, Myo opened in the Phosphor building just before Christmas, whilst the Bronze building is 42% let or in solicitors' hands. We also completed the development of 21 Moor/fields, which we sold in September 2022 for \u00a3809m, crystallising a 25% pro/fit on cost.\n\nAside from The Forge, we also opened two Myo locations at One New Change and New Street Square just before Christmas and in February, combined making up 138,000 sq ft, so all three of these are currently in lease-up.\n\nFootfall increased 3.9% and is now at c. 93% of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOn the back of this, we delivered 6.9% like-for-like income growth and a 130bps increase in occupancy to 95.4% - e/ffectively back to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we are seeing improved pricing tension and selective competition for space. A year ago we said we expected the last large overrented leases to reset during the year, which has happened. Despite this, for the /first time in years we have started capturing positive uplifts on renewals and relettings. This was still modest at 1% for the year, but is up to 6% for deals in solicitors' hands. In total, we completed 219 lettings totalling \u00a327m of rent, on average 5% ahead of ERV, with a further \u00a310m in solicitors' hands, 7% above ERV.\n\n## MIXED-USE URBAN NEIGHBOURHOODS & SUBSCALE SECTORS\n\nIn mixed-use, the increase in vacancy partly re/flects the fact that we have so far managed part of the existing income for maximum development /flexibility. We expect this to reverse with our revised approach to these assets, which involves retaining more of the existing built stock to reduce embodied carbon and build on the existing income, rather than working towards a wholesale redevelopment in one go. The operational performance of our retail parks and leisure remains strong, with \u00a37m of lettings on\n\n| OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS   |   Annualised  rental  income \u00a3m |   Net  estimated  rental value \u00a3m | EPRA  occupancy 1 %   | LFL  occupancy  change 1 ppt   | TABLE 3  WAULT 1 Years   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| West End o/ffices                  |                             160 |                               186 | 99.6                  | 0.1                            | 6.5                      |\n| City o/ffices                      |                              70 |                                93 | 93.7                  | 3.2                            | 7.8                      |\n| Retail and other                   |                              43 |                                55 | 97.2                  | 1.9                            | 5.7                      |\n| Developments                       |                               8 |                                93 | n/a                   | n/a                            | n/a                      |\n| Total Central London               |                             281 |                               427 | 97.3                  | 1.4                            | 6.8                      |\n| Shopping centres                   |                             121 |                               122 | 95.1                  | 1.0                            | 4.3                      |\n| Outlets                            |                              48 |                                49 | 96.0                  | 2.0                            | 3.0                      |\n| Total Major retail                 |                             169 |                               171 | 95.4                  | 1.3                            | 3.9                      |\n| London                             |                              11 |                                16 | 90.2                  | (3.5)                          | 9.0                      |\n| Major regional cities              |                              37 |                                38 | 93.5                  | (4.1)                          | 6.8                      |\n| Total Mixed-use urban 2            |                              48 |                                54 | 92.6                  | (4.0)                          | 7.2                      |\n| Leisure                            |                              46 |                                42 | 96.9                  | 1.6                            | 10.2                     |\n| Hotels                             |                              35 |                                29 | n/a                   | n/a                            | 7.1                      |\n| Retail parks                       |                              27 |                                29 | 97.5                  | (1.1)                          | 5.9                      |\n| Total Subscale sectors             |                             108 |                               100 | 98.0                  | 0.3                            | 8.0                      |\n| Total Combined Portfolio           |                             606 |                               752 | 96.5                  | 0.8                            | 6.2                      |\n\n- 1.

Rents are broadly in line with our underwriting assumptions, representing net margins of c. 20% over standard o/ffice space.\n\nWhilst the sharp increase in interest rates over the past two years has naturally impacted property values, the /flipside is that it is\n\nlimiting new supply. Compared to a year ago, total space under construction has increased from 12m to 13m sq ft yet 42% of this is already pre-let. This means that speculative o/ffice space under construction which is expected to complete over 2024-26 is roughly half of the long-term average new-build o/ffice take-up in London. As demand remains focused on the best, most sustainable space, we expect this will drive further rental growth for the best quality assets.\n\nAs such, during the year we started the major refurbishment of Thirty High (formerly Portland House) in Victoria and the development of Timber Square in Southwark. Re/flecting our positive outlook for rental values, we expect these to deliver a gross yield on cost of 7.2% and be highly earnings accretive, with an expected ERV of \u00a359m once fully let vs \u00a3434m residual cost to complete.\n\n| COMMITTED PIPELINE  Property   | Sector   |   Size  sq ft '000 | Estimated  completion   date   |   Net income/  ERV \u00a3m |   Market   value  \u00a3m |   Costs to  complete \u00a3m |   TDC  \u00a3m | TABLE 4 Gross yield   on TDC %   |\n|--------------------------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| Thirty High, SW1               | O/ffice  |                299 | Aug-25                         |                    30 |                  238 |                     183 |       412 | 7.3%                             |\n| Timber Square, SE1             | O/ffice  |                381 | Dec-25                         |                    29 |                  137 |                     251 |       411 | 7.1%                             |\n| Total                          |          |                680 |                                |                    59 |                  375 |                     434 |       823 | 7.2%                             |\n\n| FUTURE CENTRAL LONDON DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  Property   | Sector              | Proposed   sq ft '000   | Indicative   TDC \u00a3m   | Indicative   ERV \u00a3m   | Gross yield   on TDC %   | Potential   start   date   | TABLE 5 Planning status   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Near-term                                              |                     |                         |                       |                       |                          |                            |                           |\n| Red Lion Court, SE1                                    | O/ffice             | 250                     | 335                   | 24                    | 7.2                      | H2 2024                    | Consented                 |\n| Liberty of Southwark, SE1                              | O/ffice/residential | 225                     | 260                   | 17                    | 7.4 1                    | H1 2025                    | Consented                 |\n| Total near-term                                        |                     | 475                     | 595                   | 41                    | 7.3                      |                            |                           |\n| Medium-term                                            |                     |                         |                       |                       |                          |                            |                           |\n| Old Broad Street, EC2                                  | O/ffice             | 285                     |                       |                       |                          | 2025                       | Consented                 |\n| Hill House, EC4                                        | O/ffice             | 380                     |                       |                       |                          | 2026                       | Consented                 |\n| Nova Place, SW1                                        | O/ffice             | 60                      |                       |                       |                          | 2025                       | Design                    |\n| Southwark Bridge Road, SE1                             | O/ffice             | 150                     |                       |                       |                          | 2025                       | Design                    |\n| Timber Square Phase 2, SE1                             | O/ffice             | 290                     |                       |                       |                          | 2026                       | Design                    |\n| Total medium-term                                      |                     | 1,165                   |                       |                       |                          |                            |                           |\n| Total future pipeline                                  |                     | 1,640                   |                       |                       |                          |                            |                           |\n\n- 1. Gross yield on cost adjusted for residential TDC.\n\nIn terms of future pipeline, we have started the deconstruction of the existing building at Red Lion Court to prepare this for a potential start late this year. We also secured planning consents for the development of 55 Old Broad Street and Hill House, at our New Street Square estate, and a signi/ficant increase in scale of our planning consent at Liberty of Southwark. Combined, this brings our consented pipeline to 1.1m sq ft. We also acquired a site adjacent to Timber Square for a low implied land value of c. \u00a3100 per sq ft, which unlocks the opportunity to create a signi/ficant c. 670,000 sq ft estate across two phases, with signi/ficant public realm incorporating the site's historic Victorian railway arches.\n\n## MIXED-USE URBAN NEIGHBOURHOODS\n\nLandsec has a long history of creating thriving urban places, such as in Victoria, Oxford, Leeds or Cardi/ff. These places are scarce and their enduring attraction underpins their longer-term growth, even though the exact mix of uses of space di/ffers by location. As consumer expectations on how we live, work and spend our leisure time continue to change, we have a number of opportunities in some of the fastest growing areas in the UK to create and curate the next generation of such places.\n\nAt Finchley Road, in zone two London, we received unconditional planning consent for our 1,800 homes masterplan including detailed consent for the /first 600 homes during the year. We have started o/ffsite utility upgrades with site preparatory and enabling works to follow in autumn this year. We anticipate spending c. \u00a310m on these works over the next 18 months. This will put us in a position where we can commit to the development of the /first 600 homes by late 2025. The investment for this would be roughly \u00a3300m, with a target IRR in the low double-digits. At the same time, we will look to rebuild the income in the existing retail asset ahead of its potential longer-term redevelopment.",

Building on the successful place we have created with the new 6-acre park, we have the option to start the /first c. \u00a3140m o/ffice block late this year, which would then also unlock the future residential phases of this new mixed-use neighbourhood.\n\nAt Lewisham, south-east London, and Glasgow we are evolving our plans to focus more on masterplans that can be delivered in discrete incremental phases. Alongside this we will seek to embrace opportunities to retain and reinvent existing buildings in our ambition to reduce embodied carbon. This new approach will improve overall returns by retaining more of the existing income and growing this, alongside discrete development interventions. We are still /finalising our plans, but this will likely result in less embodied carbon, lower risk and less capital intensive routes to realising the potential of these mixed-use estates.\n\nRents for the highly sustainable, best-in-class space we can deliver in London and across our mixed-use pipeline continue to grow and construction cost in/flation has normalised, although returns on any future commitments will need to compensate for higher costs and higher exit yields. We will therefore continue to optimise designs, planning and delivery programmes to ensure our future developments deliver an attractive return and su/fficient risk premium vs the return on assets we sell to fund our investment in these. The signi/ficant size of our mediumterm London and mixed-use pipelines means it is unlikely that we will fund all of this on our own balance sheet, so we will explore opportunities to access other, complementary sources of capital to help accelerate the delivery of these opportunities.\n\n## DELIVERING IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY\n\nAligned to the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) new Net-Zero Standard, we have committed to a target to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 47% by 2030 vs a 2019/20 base year and to reach net zero by 2040 from the same base year. This includes emissions from all sources, including all of our reported Scope 3 emissions such as the emissions from our development pipeline, supply chain and customers. So far, our emissions have already reduced by 24% compared to this baseline. To align with our revised carbon reduction target, we have updated our energy intensity target to reduce energy intensity by 52% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline. We are currently tracking an 18% reduction, having achieved an energy intensity reduction across our portfolio of 3.7% vs the prior year.\n\nWe continue to progress our Net Zero Transition Investment Plan, which will ensure we deliver our near-term science-based target and meet the proposed Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard of EPC 'B' by 2030. The expected cost to deliver this plan is already re/flected in our current portfolio valuation. 49% of our portfolio is already rated 'B' or higher, including 44% of our o/ffice portfolio, up from 36% a year ago. We expect this to increase from 2025 onwards, as the bene/fits from our net zero investments come through.\n\nWe have now started the retro/fit of air source heat pumps at two o/ffice locations. We expect to start a further three retro/fit projects in the current year and are progressing detailed designs for another one. During the year, we have expanded the work with our customers on energy audits from 25 to 38 of our largest customers. These cover 56% of the energy used by our customers in our o/ffice portfolio and so far this work has identi/fied potential annual carbon and energy savings of 10-40% for the majority of customers.\n\nWith respect to our target to reduce upfront embodied carbon by 50% vs a typical development by 2030, to below 500kgCO 2 e/sqm for o/ffices and 400kgCO 2 e/sqm for residential, our future pipeline is currently tracking at an average 40% reduction. The two schemes we started this year are already close to, or ahead of our 2030 reduction target. At Timber Square, we achieved a reduction to 522kgCO 2 e/sqm due to retention of part of the existing structure, a highly optimised design and the use of low carbon cross laminated timber, whilst at Thirty High, retaining the original structure and upgrading the existing fa\u00e7ade resulted in an upfront embodied carbon intensity of just 347kgCO 2 e/sqm.\n\nIn March, we launched our new nature strategy, Let Nature In, which recognises the interdependency between the climate and biodiversity crises and aims to consistently enhance nature across our portfolio to improve biodiversity in the built environment; promote health, wellbeing, and community engagement; and create nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nOur Landsec Futures fund, which will see us invest \u00a320m over 2023-2033, aimed at improving social mobility in real estate and tackling issues local to our assets, continues to support the delivery of our 2030 target to create \u00a3200m of social value and empower 30,000 people towards the world of work. From our 2019/20 baseline, we have so far created \u00a354m of social value and empowered 10,249 people.",

Underlying EPRA EPS of 50.1p, excluding \u00a322m year-on-year increase in surrender premiums.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe condensed consolidated preliminary /financial information is prepared under UK adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs and IFRICs) where the Group's interests in joint ventures are shown collectively in the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100%. Internally, management reviews the Group's results on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.0bn, is an example of this approach, re/flecting our economic interest in our properties regardless of our ownership structure.\n\nOur key measure of underlying earnings performance is EPRA earnings, which represents the underlying /financial performance of the Group's property rental business, which is our core operating activity. A full de/finition of EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. This measure is based on the Best Practices Recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) which are metrics widely used across the industry to aid comparability and includes our proportionate share of joint ventures' earnings. Similarly, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share is our primary measure of net asset value.\n\nMeasures presented on a proportionate basis are alternative performance measures as they are not de/fined under IFRS. This presentation provides additional information to stakeholders on the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements. For further details see table 57 in the Business analysis section.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nExternal market conditions improved as the year progressed. The relative stability in interest rates of late, after the signi/ficant rise in the /first half of the year, material reduction in in/flation and return to real wage growth for consumers are all supportive for the outlook. Even though we do not anticipate a sharp reduction in rates, our high-quality portfolio, strong operational performance and robust capital base provide an attractive base for future growth.\n\nRe/flecting the continued strength in customer demand, like-for-like gross rental income was up 3.0%, or 2.8% on a net rental income basis, driven by a further increase in occupancy, positive uplifts on relettings and renewals, and growth in turnover income. Combined with a reduction in overhead costs, this o/ffset the impact of higher /finance costs and disposals. As a result, our EPRA earnings were in line with the prior year's underlying level of \u00a3371m and, in line with our guidance, EPRA EPS was stable at 50.1 pence. Our total dividend for the year of 39.6 pence is up 2.6%, in line with our guidance of low single digit percentage growth. Our dividend cover of 1.27x remains comfortably within our target range of 1.2-1.3x on an annual basis.\n\nOur successful leasing activity increased overall occupancy and drove 3.2% growth in ERVs but as investment volumes across the wider market remained subdued, the valuation of our portfolio was down \u00a3625m, or 6.0%. This was driven by an increase in valuation yields in the /first half of the year in particular, as c. 60% of our portfolio was stable in value in the second half. This yield movement primarily drove an overall IFRS loss before tax of \u00a3341m and basic EPS of -43.0 pence, compared with a loss of \u00a3622m for the prior year, and a reduction in EPRA NTA per share of 8.2% to 859 pence. Including dividends paid, our total return on equity was -4.0%, re/flecting a 5.3% income return and 4.2% upside from ERV growth and developments, o/ffset by -13.5% on account of yield shift.\n\nOur balance sheet remains strong and comfortably within our operating guidelines. Net debt increased slightly by \u00a30.2bn to \u00a33.5bn during the year, which combined with the valuation movement of our portfolio resulted in an LTV of 35.0% at the end of",

More importantly, at a time when investment activity is low and the approach to valuations varies widely in di/fferent markets, as a cash measure, our net debt/ EBITDA at the year-end remained low at 7.4x vs 7.0x a year ago, in line with our target to keep this below 8x. Moreover, pro-forma for our \u00a30.4bn of disposals since the year-end, our net debt/EBITDA is down to 7.0x whilst our 32.3% LTV is lower than it was in March 2022, before the correction in values, and net debt is \u00a31.1bn down since then. Combined with our average debt maturity of 9.5 years\n\nand \u00a31.9bn of cash and undrawn facilities, this provides substantial capacity to invest in growth.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\nOur strong leasing performance continues to underpin the growth of our high-quality income. Our proactive disposals over the past two years have created room for future growth, even though this came at a modest cost to income during the year. Finance costs increased due to a rise in interest rates and lower capitalised interest following our recent\n\ndevelopment completions, but this has been o/ffset by our positive like-for-like income growth, income from our successful developments and a reduction in administrative expenses.\n\nHeadline EPRA earnings in the prior year bene/fited from a \u00a322m year-on-year increase in surrender premiums received, which we adjusted for in the underlying earnings we reported a year ago. As such, EPRA earnings of \u00a3371m are in line with the prior year's underlying level.\n\n| INCOME STATEMENT 1                                          | TABLE 7             | TABLE 7          | TABLE 7              | TABLE 7              | TABLE 7   | TABLE 7             | TABLE 7          | TABLE 7              | TABLE 7              | TABLE 7   | TABLE 7   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                             | Central  London  \u00a3m | Major  retail \u00a3m | Mixed- use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Central  London  \u00a3m | Major  retail \u00a3m | Mixed- use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Change \u00a3m |\n| Gross rental income 2                                       | 291                 | 181              | 57                   | 112                  | 641       | 310                 | 171              | 57                   | 109                  | 647       | (6)       |\n| Net service charge expense                                  | (4)                 | (7)              | (3)                  | (2)                  | (16)      | (1)                 | (8)              | (2)                  | (1)                  | (12)      | (4)       |\n| Net direct property expenditure                             | (24)                | (23)             | (12)                 | (16)                 | (75)      | (20)                | (31)             | (10)                 | (13)                 | (74)      | (1)       |\n| Segment net rental income                                   | 263                 | 151              | 42                   | 94                   | 550       | 289                 | 132              | 45                   | 95                   | 561       | (11)      |\n| Net administrative expenses                                 |                     |                  |                      |                      | (77)      |                     |                  |                      |                      | (84)      | 7         |\n| EPRA earnings before interest                               |                     |                  |                      |                      | 473       |                     |                  |                      |                      | 477       | (4)       |\n| Net /finance expense                                        |                     |                  |                      |                      | (102)     |                     |                  |                      |                      | (84)      | (18)      |\n| EPRA earnings                                               |                     |                  |                      |                      | 371       |                     |                  |                      |                      | 393 3     | (22)      |\n| Capital/other items                                         |                     |                  |                      |                      |           |                     |                  |                      |                      |           |           |\n| Valuation de/ficit                                          |                     |                  |                      |                      | (625)     |                     |                  |                      |                      | (848)     | 223       |\n| Loss on changes in /finance leases                          |                     |                  |                      |                      | -

Underlying EPRA earnings of \u00a3371m excluding \u00a322m year-on-year increase in surrender premiums.\n\n## NET RENTAL INCOME\n\nReported gross rental income was down \u00a36m to \u00a3641m, but up \u00a316m adjusted for the aforementioned \u00a322m year-on-year increase in surrender premiums in the prior year and up 3.0% on a like-for-like basis excluding the impact of these movements. Surrender premiums over the last twelve months were \u00a32m higher than the underlying level over the previous two years, at \u00a318m, part of which relates to income foregone during the year. We expect surrender receipts going forward to be lower than the levels in recent years, as a result of lower levels of customer rightsizing or repurposing activity across our portfolio.\n\nNet rental income was up \u00a311m on an underlying basis. Direct property costs increased by \u00a31m and net service charge expenses were up \u00a34m, primarily driven by the costs associated with the initial lease-up phase of our recent London o/ffice developments. The impact from the repurposing of conventional o/ffice space to introduce two Myos reduced net rental income by \u00a32m, but given the c. 20% premium on Myo rent we achieve, we expect this to more than reverse as we lease up this space. Investment activity reduced income by \u00a39m, re/flecting our signi/ficant deleveraging. On a like-for-like basis, our net rental income was up \u00a313m, or 2.8%. Re/flecting continued demand for our space,\n\nwe expect like-for-like growth for the current year to be broadly similar.\n\nIn line with our guidance, our gross to net margin for the year reduced slightly to 85.8% from 86.7% in the prior year due to the start-up costs of opening three new Myo locations and our completed developments. The sale of our hotel portfolio will reduce our overall margin but on a like-for-like basis we expect our gross to net margin to improve so we expect our overall margin to be broadly stable this year. Overall, insolvencies remain low, with rent from customers in administration at 0.4%, in line with the prior year.",

Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n- 2. Gross rental income on a like-for-like basis and the impact of developments, acquisitions and disposals exclude surrender premiums received.\n\n## NET ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nNet administrative expenses were down \u00a37m to \u00a377m, as the cost savings from the organisational review we undertook in late 2022 and our continued focus on ensuring our cost base is e/fficient more than o/ffset in/flation. For the current year, we expect continued e/fficiency improvements to o/ffset in/flation and we anticipate further savings from our investments in data and technology over time.\n\nOur EPRA cost ratio was virtually stable at 25.0% vs 25.2% in the prior year, which re/flects our capital allocation decisions. Naturally, assets with long leases to a single tenant often have lower operating costs than more operational sectors such as /flexible o/ffice, shopping centres, or for example residential, yet this does not mean they generate a better overall return. Illustrating this, over the last three years we have sold \u00a32.2bn of virtually triple-net o/ffices with a 17-year lease term where our ability to add further value was limited and which had an expected mid-single digit forward IRR. We invested in more operational assets with a higher net income yield and much higher IRR,\n\nwhich clearly improved our overall returns, even though the combined impact of this increased our EPRA cost ratio by almost 3ppt.\n\n## NET FINANCE EXPENSES\n\nNet interest costs increased by \u00a318m to \u00a3102m, which re/flected an increase in our weighted average cost of debt and a reduction in capitalised interest following the completion of our recent London developments, partly o/ffset by our deleveraging through disposals. All else equal, we expect net interest costs for this year to be up slightly, as the reduction in debt following our recent disposals is o/ffset by an increase in average borrowing costs re/flecting our recent \u00a3300m bond issue and the higher average /floating rate compared to last year, with 94% of our debt /fixed or hedged at the end of March.\n\nNon-cash /finance income, which includes the fair value movements on derivatives, caps and hedging and which is not included in EPRA earnings, decreased from a net income of \u00a323m during the prior year to a net expense of \u00a324m. This is predominantly\n\ndue to the fair value movements of our interest-rate swaps as a result of the increase in interest rates over the period.\n\n## VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nThe independent external valuation of our Combined Portfolio showed a reduction in value of \u00a3625m. Our strong leasing activity resulted in 3.2% ERV growth, yet the upside of this was more than o/ffset by a 45bps increase in valuation yields driven by the sharp increase in bond yields during the /first half of the year. This upwards pressure on yields reduced during the second half, as our valuers indicated yields were broadly stable in the /final quarter of the year.\n\n## IFRS LOSS AFTER TAX\n\nSubstantially all our activity during the year was covered by UK REIT legislation, which means our tax charge for the period remained minimal. The IFRS loss after tax primarily as a result of the above fair value adjustment of our investment portfolio moderated to \u00a3341m, compared to \u00a3622m for the prior year.",

Our income return on NTA is an attractive 5.3%, whilst ERV growth and development upside drove a capital return of 4.2%. The combination of these two\n\nfactors therefore yielded a return of 9.5%, with the remaining negative impact driven by an increase in valuations yields. As yields for the best assets begin to stabilise, this shows we are inherently well placed to deliver the 8-10% return on equity we target over time.\n\nAfter the \u00a3291m of dividends paid, EPRA Net Tangible Assets, which re/flects the value of our Combined Portfolio less adjusted net debt, reduced to \u00a36,398m, or 859 pence per share. This represents an 8.2% reduction versus the prior year, half of which was made up for by dividends.\n\n| BALANCE SHEET 1                                                           | 31 March  2024 \u00a3m   | TABLE 9 31 March  2023 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Combined Portfolio                                                        | 9,963               | 10,239                      |\n| Adjusted net debt                                                         | (3,517)             | (3,287)                     |\n| Other net assets                                                          | (48)                | 15                          |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets                                                  | 6,398               | 6,967                       |\n| Shortfall of fair value over net investment in /finance leases book value | 5                   | 6                           |\n| Other intangible asset                                                    | 2                   | 2                           |\n| Excess of fair value over trading properties book value                   | (25)                | (12)                        |\n| Fair value of interest-rate swaps                                         | 22                  | 42                          |\n| Net assets, excluding amounts due to non-controlling interests            | 6,402               | 7,005                       |\n| Net assets per share                                                      | 863p                | 945p                        |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share (diluted)                              | 859p                | 936p                        |\n\n- 1.

We spent \u00a3137m on acquisitions and invested \u00a3328m in capex, largely on London o/ffice developments, the preparation of future developments and the investment in our existing assets. This was partly o/ffset by the sale of investment properties generating receipts of \u00a3176m during the period.\n\nSince the year-end we have sold \u00a3400m of assets, which would reduce adjusted net debt to \u00a33,117m on a pro-forma basis. Following the completion of our recent London pipeline, we have \u00a3399m committed capex to spend over the next two years on our two new projects in Victoria and Southbank.\n\nThe other key elements behind the decrease in net debt are set out in our statement of cash /flows and note 13 to the /financial statements, with the main movements in adjusted net debt shown below. A reconciliation between net debt and adjusted net debt is shown in note 21 of the /financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\nfr\n\n- 1.  Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n\nDue to the modest increase in borrowings, net debt/EBITDA increased slightly to 7.4x based on our net debt at the end of March 2024, or 7.3x based on our weighted-average net debt for the period. We target net debt/ EBITDA to remain below 8x over time. Group LTV which includes our share of JVs, increased from 31.7% to 35.0%. This reduces to 32.3% pro-forma for the hotels disposal post the year-end, which is 2.1ppt lower than it was in March 2022, before the sharp rise in interest rates and resulting correction in property values. We expect our LTV to increase slightly from this level as we will look to invest at an attractive point in the cycle, but to remain within our target range of 25% to 40%.\n\n| NET DEBT AND LEVERAGE              | 31 March  2024   | TABLE 12 31 March  2023   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| Net debt                           | \u00a33,594m          | \u00a33,348m                   |\n| Adjusted net debt 1                | \u00a33,517m          | \u00a33,287m                   |\n| Interest cover ratio               | 3.9x             | 4.5x                      |\n| Net debt/EBITDA (period-end)       | 7.4x             | 7.0x                      |\n| Net debt/EBITDA (weighted average) | 7.3x             | 8.0x                      |\n| Group LTV 1                        | 35.0%            | 31.7%                     |\n| Security Group LTV                 | 37.0%            | 33.0%                     |\n\n- 1.

Our MTNs and the majority of bank loans form part of our Security Group, which provides security on a /floating pool of assets valued at \u00a39.2bn. This structure provides /flexibility to include or exclude assets, and an attractive cost of funding, with our MTNs currently rated AA and AA- with a stable outlook respectively by S&P and Fitch.\n\nOur Security Group has a number of tiered covenants, yet below 65% LTV and above\n\n1.45x ICR, these involve very limited operational restrictions. A default only occurs when LTV is more than 100% or the ICR falls below 1.0x. Our portfolio could withstand a c. 43% fall in value before we reach the 65% LTV threshold and c. 63% before reaching 100% LTV, whilst our EBITDA could fall by c. 63% before we reach the 1.45x ICR threshold and c. 74% before reaching 1.0x ICR.\n\nWe had \u00a31.9bn of cash and undrawn facilities at the end of March 2024, providing substantial /flexibility. As expected, the percentage of borrowings which is /fixed or hedged reduced slightly to 94%, re/flecting our net investment in the year. Across the\n\nyear we redeemed \u00a3427m of MTNs on their expected maturity dates. In March, we issued a \u00a3300m bond with a maturity of 7.5 years at 4.75%, representing a spread of 103bps over the reference gilt rate. This spread shows the strength of our credit pro/file, and ensured our overall debt maturity remains long, at 9.5 years, providing clear visibility and underpinning the resilience of our attractive earnings pro/file. Our average cost of debt rose to 3.3% compared with 2.7% in the prior year. Re/flecting our strong /financial position, we expect this to increase only slightly during the year ahead. At the end of March 2024, we had a limited \u00a3306m of debt maturing in the next two years.\n\n| AVAILABLE FACILITIES 1                     | 31 March  2024 \u00a3m   | TABLE 13 31 March  2023 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Medium Term Notes                          | 2,607               | 2,736                        |\n| Drawn bank debt                            | 415                 | 383                          |\n| Outstanding commercial paper               | 681                 | 312                          |\n| Cash and available undrawn facilities      | 1,889               | 2,353                        |\n| Total committed credit facilities          | 2,907               | 3,007                        |\n| Weighted average maturity of debt          | 9.5 years           | 10.3 years                   |\n| Percentage of borrowings fixed or hedged 1 | 94%                 | 98%                          |\n| Weighted average cost of debt 2            | 3.3%                | 2.7%                         |\n\n- 1. Calculated as /fixed rate debt and hedges over gross debt based on the nominal values of debt and hedges.\n- 2. Including amortisation and commitment fees; excluding this the weighted average cost of debt is 3.2% at 31 March 2024.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nLooking ahead, our high-quality portfolio, strong operational performance actions and strong capital base mean that, with an LTV and net debt position which is lower than it was two years ago, we are well placed to invest at an attractive point in the cycle.\n\nWe maintain our target to deliver an 8-10% annual return on equity over time, comprising a mix of income and capital returns, driven by rental growth and selective development upside. Short-term movements in valuation yields are outside of our control, and mean our return on equity will not be exactly in this range each individual year, as we have seen over the past twelve months. However, with an income return on NTA of c. 5.7%, an expectation of further low-to-mid single digit ERV growth in London and Major Retail this year and yields starting to stabilise, the outlook for this is encouraging.\n\nWe are now capturing positive leasing reversion, which supported 2.8% growth in like-for-like net rental income over the past\n\nyear and we expect growth for the current year to be similar. How this will translate into EPS growth depends on the quantum and timing of net investment from here. We have meaningful balance sheet capacity following our signi/ficant disposals yet our recent sales will reduce annualised earnings by c. 4%, all else equal. This means that, before re/flecting the impact of any reinvestment of these sales proceeds, EPS for the year to March 2025 would likely be slightly below the 50.1 pence for 2024. For March 2026, we currently expect EPS to be slightly above this level, re/flecting the combined e/ffect of continued like-for-like income growth and accretive capital recycling. As a result, we continue to expect our dividend to grow by a low single digit percentage this year, as our dividend cover remains towards the high end of our 1.2-1.3x target range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVANESSA SIMMS, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER",

In 2023, we created Shadow Boards to add more diverse perspectives to decision making in those areas (see page 57). Throughout this year we have operated under this new structure which has provided enhanced focus on our customers and associated strategies for those business areas.\n\n## OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nIn April 2023, we launched Landsec Futures, a fund designed to maximise the potential of people, places and communities by enhancing social mobility and creating pathways into our industry for people from under-represented backgrounds.\n\nWe've committed to investing \u00a320m into Landsec Futures over ten years, which will enable us to meet our corporate commitment to help 30,000 people facing barriers towards the world of work, creating \u00a3200m in social value for our communities.\n\nTo understand in more detail some of the communities our assets are located within, the Board has reviewed in detail the May/field, O2 Finchley Road, Lewisham, Buchanan Galleries, Glasgow, St David's Cardi/ff, Cambridge Leisure and Hartree projects.

There were a number of suggested improvements for the next cohort.\n\nDuring the year there were also three engagement events run with two Nonexecutive Directors and a cross section of up to 15 employees. During these sessions it was highlighted that there was a lot of enthusiasm for Landsec generally, and for engaging with the Board in an informal manner. Topics discussed included speci/fic business topics, delegation of authority, diversity and inclusion, the culture, hybrid working and the refresh of the headquarters o/ffice. There was a meet the Board event in July with a group of around 70 employees and the whole Board which was very well received.\n\nIn August 2023, we introduced Shadow Boards who shadow our Workplace and Lifestyle Boards (see page 57 for more details). The Shadow Board members met with James Bowling and Madeleine Cosgrave to discuss their experiences and feedback. Overall the feedback was very positive and it was clear that the shadow boards had a positive impact from a personal development perspective.\n\nOur Employee Forum represents our employee voice. They meet monthly, with four quarterly meetings with our CEO and Chief People O/fficer to answer any questions and get insights into issues of importance to employees. Manjiry also met the Employee Forum twice this year, where the discussion covered the performance and reward culture (including salary and bene/fits) at Landsec.\n\nThe Board received a full brie/fing on the employee engagement survey which was undertaken in summer 2023 and a summary of our Pulse survey in the autumn, which provided them with good insights into employee sentiment (see page 25 for more on our engagement survey).\n\nFinally, a number of our Non-executive Directors attended our annual spotlight awards event in March 2024, celebrating individual and team achievements that had taken place during the prior year.\n\n## OUR PARTNERS\n\nWe have strong relationships with our suppliers and are signatories of the Prompt Payment Code. In 2022 we launched our Supply Chain Commitment. More information on our relationships with our suppliers and associated processes is available on our website.\n\nIn 2023, we undertook a signi/ficant re-tender of our facilities management providers across our Workplace and Lifestyle businesses. Our Future of Facilities Programme explored the latest innovations in facilities management, helping us to identify the best service partners in the market, and enabling us to design the best operating model for us to achieve sustainable operational excellence, best-in-class customer experience, and a safe and secure environment in a post-Covid world. The programme was a signi/ficant e/ffort, with collaboration across the business, and has now completed with new service partners onboarded. The Board approved the Future of Facilities Programme in November 2023.\n\nThe Board was also updated regularly during the year by our Managing Director, Corporate A/ffairs & Sustainability, on changes in the political landscape in the UK.\n\n## OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nDuring the year, the Board appointed Manjiry Tamhane as the Non-executive Director responsible for Employee Engagement and Whistleblowing.

By actively seeking feedback, we gain valuable insights into our progress towards our objectives and areas for enhancement.\n\nOur People Survey serves as a cornerstone in measuring our advancement and pinpointing areas necessitating action. This year, we implemented a bi-annual approach, introducing a Pulse Survey in October 2023, complementing the comprehensive survey conducted in June 2023. We actively benchmark against industry peers, those in similar sized organisations and the highest performing companies, shedding light on engagement levels, company-wide initiatives, and inclusivity. Achieving an 89% response rate, our engagement rating increased from 84% in June 2023 to exceed the high-performance benchmark (87%) achieving 89% in October 2023.\n\nThis compares to an engagement score of 77% in 2022. Our comprehensive survey in June 2023 highlighted three main areas of opportunity: career development, internal communication and rewards and recognition. We have focused on these areas of employee engagement through both targeted actions and our ongoing plans. Actions included:\n\n- \u00b7 continuing the integration of our Annual Performance Planning (APP) and Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) approaches, which closely align and link individual contributions to company and business unit/enabling function performance\n- \u00b7 introducing our all employee Share Incentive Plan, MySIP, achieving a signi/ficant participation of just under 40% within three months, further aligning our employees' interests with the company's success\n- \u00b7 conducting a bene/fits review through engagement with employees, to re/fine our future bene/fits package ensuring we o/ffer the most value for our people and holding two Bene/fits Expos to increase awareness of our bene/fits o/fferings\n- \u00b7 enhanced internal communication channels, streamlining, and expanding digital platforms to foster dialogue throughout the organisation\n- \u00b7 implementation of an o/ffice refresh to create a collaborative, productive and enjoyable workspace\n- \u00b7 a purpose-built Urban Inspiration Day to connect all employees with our purpose\n- \u00b7 a series of live events covering diverse topics led by internal and external experts to broaden knowledge across various disciplines and business areas\n- \u00b7 launching Spotlight Rewards, our 'always on' recognition platform, empowering all employees to recognise, appreciate, and celebrate each other's achievements.\n\n## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION\n\nThis year we refreshed our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) strategy 'Diverse Talent, Inclusive Culture, Inclusive Places'.",

This is due to an increase in female representation at executive level with two new female executives, and small increases in female representation within our Senior Leader and Leader populations.\n\n- \u00b7 our mean ethnicity pay gap increased from 36.5% in 2022 to 43.0% in 2023\n- \u00b7 our median ethnicity pay gap increased from 37.6% to 39.4% in the same period\n\nDisappointingly, we saw an increase in our ethnicity pay gaps. This was driven by a high number of ethnic minority hires into our more junior professional and support roles over the preceding 12 months. Over the same time period, we also had a few of our most senior ethnic minority employees leave us. As a business that is relatively small by headcount, even a small number of changes in representation at our most senior levels can have a signi/ficant impact on our pay gap data.\n\n* After welcoming mixed-use regeneration business U+I into the Landsec Group, we have chosen to voluntarily publish pay gap data for all of our employees who are on one PAYE reference. This includes both Landsec Securities Properties Ltd, and U and I Group Ltd and we refer to it as 'Landsec Group' in our pay gap reporting.",

Over the past 12 months, progress has been made towards achieving our 2030 gender diversity targets, with good levels of growth in female representation at Senior Leader level from 31% to 38% and Executive level from 33% to 40%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n20% of our sta/ff are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year. We have continued to grow ethnic diversity in our junior populations and at Board and Executive level but have unfortunately not seen growth in ethnic minority representation in our leadership populations - a key focus of our D&I plans for the upcoming year.\n\n## TALENT MANAGEMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING\n\nWith our focus on high performance, our approach to talent and development has evolved to re/flect this. As a result, we have been building on our previous general leadership development programme strategy, to introduce a more targeted talent development approach coupled with curated learning pathways for all.\n\nWe have introduced a bi-annual Group Talent Review cadence, to provide the data to inform the targeted development tools. The approach is aimed at enhancing our talent management strategy and driving organisational e/ffectiveness. Outputs of this approach are:\n\n- \u00b7 succession plans for all our Executive Leadership Team and Senior Leadership Team roles\n- \u00b7 development of a targeted talent development programme for our emergent leaders called Landsec Builds: next level leadership\n- \u00b7 a further targeted talent programme with a D&I lens, called Enrich\n\nTo equip our Senior Leadership population to shape and drive the high-performance methodology and ethos through the organisation we have launched a highperformance leadership masterclass for senior leaders.\n\nTo empower and develop our colleagues, we have introduced Shadow Boards, giving members the opportunity to join our Lifestyle and Workplace Boards. The objective is to drive diverse thinking across our business through encouraging a range of voices and backgrounds and experiences to be involved in our decision making.\n\nOur 'Next Level' learning platform has been introduced to enhance the skills, knowledge and behaviour of all of our people, and sets out the approach and the mindset that we need to achieve our high-performance culture ambition. Next Level provides the backdrop, alongside curated learning\n\npathways, against which all of our Talent & Development o/fferings are built and delivered, and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 knowledge: where we have come from, what we have learnt and where we are going\n- \u00b7 skills: increasing capability through skills acquisition and development, aligned to our /five di/fferentiators, to deliver competitive advantage\n- \u00b7 behaviour: developing our high-performance culture through the promotion and support of complementary behaviours\n\nWe are proud that our people are committed to their personal and professional development with each person completing an average of 7 hours and 35 minutes of learning this year. Next Level allows us to enhance the development experience with a re/fined training o/ffer, ensuring that the training content is most pertinent, irrespective of role or level. By investing in our employees' growth and skills development, we are not only boosting their individual capabilities but also strengthening Landsec overall.\n\n## RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION\n\nEmployee turnover has decreased compared with the last /financial year. For voluntary turnover, this correlates with the improvement in engagement scores and suggests potential improvements in employee satisfaction. Involuntary turnover rates have also shown a slight decrease this year.\n\nRegrettable turnover, which typically involves the loss of high-performing or critical employees, shows a variable pattern across quarters. Despite /fluctuations, there's a slight downward trend in regrettable turnover rates, indicating the actions detailed above are having an impact. Average headcount in the rolling 12-month period remains relatively stable.\n\nA key initiative to improve recruitment practices was the introduction of a new approach to leadership hiring - including removing bias from job descriptions, using employee interview panels and setting gender and ethnic diversity targets for recruiter shortlists.\n\nWe have also continued to focus on developing our own internal pipeline of talent with great skills, behaviours and capabilities. This has resulted in 43 internal promotions, 25 of whom were female appointments.",

RICS Sustainability Report 2023.\n- 2. Edelman's Trust Barometer 2023.\n\nThe connection between climate change and nature is becoming increasingly evident. During the year we have seen biodiversity growing in importance to corporate sustainability, and an alignment between companies' nature and climate strategies. The launch of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and nature being a key theme at COP28, further re/flects the interdependence between the two themes.\n\nDemand for climate-adapted real estate is growing1 as o/ffice occupiers and retailers continue to consider the role of physical space in their business model, and set increasingly ambitious sustainability targets. The belief that businesses should take the lead in tackling key societal and environmental issues is also mounting, with 82%2 of the public now expecting CEOs to take a public stand on climate change.\n\nAs such, we recognise that maintaining strong sustainability performance remains key to the value of our business. Our sustainability strategy - Build well, Live well, Act well - continues to focus our work on the ESG issues where we know we can have the biggest impact.\n\n24%\n\nREDUCTION IN ABSOLUTE CARBON EMISSIONS SINCE 2019/20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DECARBONISING OUR PORTFOLIO\n\n## ALIGNING OUR TARGETS TO CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nIn March 2023, we updated our science-based carbon reduction targets to align with the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) NetZero Standard, committing to reducing all our direct and indirect emissions by 47% by 2030, from a 2019/20 baseline. This target will build towards a long-term goal of reaching net zero by 2040, achieving a 90% reduction in absolute emissions from a 2019/20 baseline.\n\nWe have also updated our energy target, committing to reducing energy intensity by 52% by 2030, from a 2019/20 baseline. In 2023/24, we achieved an energy intensity reduction of 18%.\n\n## PROGRESSING OUR NET ZERO TRANSITION INVESTMENT PLAN\n\nSince launching our \u00a3135m Net Zero Transition Investment Plan (NZTIP) in 2021, we have invested \u00a38.2m to ensure we meet our near-term carbon reduction target. Since launch we have progressed the following activities:\n\n## ' AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMP RETROFIT\n\nWe started replacement works at 16 Palace Street and Dashwood House, and plan to start installation at a further three buildings over the coming year.\n\n- ' BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BMS) OPTIMISATION\n\nWe completed BMS reviews and implemented recommended optimisations at 11 operational London assets, with expected energy savings of between 5% and 15% per building.\n\n## ' AI TRIAL\n\nWe ran a 12-month trial with Brainbox AI at 80-100 Victoria Street, where the technology controls heating and cooling. An additional 5% energy savings is expected.\n\n## ' SOLAR PV PANEL INSTALLATION\n\nWe began construction to install solar PV at Gunwharf Quays in March 2024 and completed feasibility studies for additional on-site renewable capacity at Braintree Village and Trinity Leeds.",

We identi/fied potential annual carbon and energy savings of 10-40% for the majority of customers. Of the /first 18 occupiers participating in the customer engagement programme, overall they have achieved a 20% electricity reduction compared to 2019/20. The impact of this programme was re/flected in our 2023 customersatisfaction survey, with 79% of o/ffice customers saying we are doing a good job of supporting them in achieving their sustainability goals.\n\nThis year, we have conducted net zero audits, heat pump feasibility studies and BMS optimisation reviews across our retail assets to understand what we need to do to decarbonise and improve the energy e/fficiency of landlord controlled areas. These initiatives will support our NZTIP to meet our near-term carbon reduction target, and accelerate progress towards our ambition to become net zero by 2040.\n\n## CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN AND OFFSETTING STRATEGY\n\nFollowing the publication of the Transition Plan Task Force (TPT) Disclosure Framework in October 2023, we have been developing a Climate Transition Plan. This plan will articulate our strategic ambition and targets, outlining key steps we are taking to decarbonise our business and reach net zero across our value chain by 2040.\n\nIn addition to reducing our emissions, we also aim to support 'beyond value chain mitigation' (BVCM). This includes activities that avoid, reduce, or remove and store carbon emissions, also known as carbon o/ffsets. This year, we have enhanced our o/ffsetting strategy, developing rigorous\n\ndue-diligence criteria and a process in line with UKGBC recommendations.\n\n## EPC RATINGS\n\nOur portfolio is 100% compliant with the 2023 MEES of EPC E or above. In addition, 49% of our portfolio - 44% of o/ffices and 55% of retail - already meets the proposed MEES of EPC B. As we progress our NZTIP, we expect that half our o/ffice portfolio will reach EPC B by 2025 and all of our portfolio will meet the proposed MEES by 2030.\n\n## REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES\n\nWe have made considerable progress in reducing upfront embodied carbon across our development pipeline, achieving a 40% reduction compared to a typical building.\n\nWe monitor embodied carbon from the outset of each scheme, and collaborate with our supply partners to reduce emissions through:\n\n- \u00b7 Structural retention and material reuse - at Hill House, we are retaining 58% of the existing structure, resulting in signi/ficant carbon savings.\n- \u00b7 Designing-out material - we have challenged our teams to use less material and remove redundant capacity from our structural solutions, such as designing-out raised-access /floor tiles and removing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems through natural ventilation. At the Republic in Manchester, we have reduced the size of our structural grid, leading to around a 10% reduction in concrete required.\n- \u00b7 Changing our speci/fications to low-carbon materials alternatives - at Timber Square, we have sourced 115 tonnes of reused steel.\n\nThis year we re/fined our Sustainable Development Toolkit to align with our refurbishment projects, re/flecting the fact that refurbishments need a case-by-case approach, with project-speci/fic targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo encourage innovation, in September 2023, our development team hosted a full-day event for almost 90 Landsec colleagues. They showcased each of our live projects, focusing on sustainability targets and performance, and received valuable knowledge and lessons in return. This included the costed pathway for achieving our carbon reduction targets across our developments, and presenting a business case for low-carbon innovations to support achieving our targets.\n\n## REDUCING CARBON AT TIMBER SQUARE\n\nAt Timber Square, SE1, we have retained 80% of the existing structure, while using a lightweight, hybrid steel and cross-laminated timber (CLT) structure. This has resulted in Timber Square being around 20% lower in weight than if built with traditional building materials. By sourcing 115 tonnes of reused steel, we have saved approximately 276 tonnes of carbon while helping the circular economy, which has dramatically reduced the project's upfront embodied carbon intensity. Timber Square remains on track to achieve an upfront embodied carbon intensity of around 50% less than a typical o/ffice building.\n\nOnce completed, the development will be the UK's /first Design for Performance project to complete its Independent Design Review with a targeted 5* NABERS UK energy rating. This means it will be net zero in accordance with UK Green Building Council guidelines and powered by renewable energy sources. The scheme has been recognised as a model case study by the World Green Building Council (WGBC) and New London Architecture (NLA).",

This will help us to further: reduce embodied and whole-life carbon; promote reuse and circular economy principles; align to green building certi/fication requirements and strengthen our approach to tackling modern slavery.\n\n## WASTE\n\nIn 2023/24 we continued to divert 100% of waste from land/fill, and recycled 66% of operational waste (2022/23: 68%). We are also embedding circular-economy principles across our developments, to minimise waste, and have achieved a 99.5% recycling rate for new developments.\n\n## WATER\n\nWe strive to use water e/fficiently. Across our developments, at design stage, we follow our Sustainable Development Toolkit to incorporate water e/fficiency, and explore the use of water-recycling strategies. For operational assets under our control, the water-management assessments undertaken last year continue to help shape our water strategy for both our o/ffice and retail portfolios. Initiatives include installing automatic meter reading across our portfolio, testing technology to obtain more detail of where water is consumed in our buildings and to identify potential leaks, and developing a water standard for the taps, toilets and showers in our facilities.\n\n## ENHANCING NATURE AND GREEN SPACES\n\nWe believe that more nature leads to better, more desirable places which, in turn, contributes to shaping sustainable cities. Therefore, we want to use our places as a catalyst to improve nature in the urban environment.\n\n## LAUNCHING 'LET NATURE IN'\n\nIn March 2024, we launched a new strategy for enhancing nature at our operational assets and developments. The strategy centres on three principles that will guide our approach to designing, developing and managing our places to bene/fit nature and the people that live, work and play in our spaces:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIMPROVE BIODIVERSITY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT\n\nPROMOTE HEALTH, WELLBEING AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\nCREATE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow we apply these principles, and what this means in practice for our developments and operational sites, is detailed in our new 'Let Nature In' strategy available at landsec.com.\n\nFollowing the publication of the TNFD recommendations in September 2023, we have signed up as an Adopter, committing to start disclosing nature-related information in line with the recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREAD OUR TNFD DISCLOSURE IN OUR 2024 SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE AND DATA REPORT\n\nENHANCING\n\nBIODIVERSITY\n\nIN MANCHESTER\n\nAt May/field, Manchester, we have\n\nredeveloped 6.5 acres of brown/field land to create an urban park - the /first in the centre of Manchester in 100 years.

We undertook a project during the year to identify whether reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) was present in our portfolio. It was found in two assets and action was taken to mitigate the risk. We continue to work with other companies in our sector to establish consistency in measuring and reporting health and safety data, to enable performance benchmarking with our peer group.\n\nFire safety remains one of our priority focus areas, and we have continued our work to ensure we meet new government initiatives and legislation. We have also maintained our /fire-safety management-system certi/fication to the BS 9997 standard. All high-rise residential buildings above 11 metres in our portfolio have been examined by independent /fire engineers to ensure they remain safe for occupation, and meet stringent new building regulations.\n\n## BUSINESS ETHICS\n\nThis year, we have refreshed our employee code of conduct, updating our policies and content on harassment and bullying, inside information, buying and selling Landsec shares, staying cyber-secure and speaking up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 300+\n\nSUPPLIERS SIGNED UP TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN COMMITMENT, WHICH INCLUDES ALMOST 80% OF OUR STRATEGIC SUPPLIERS",

We have considered these over the short (<1 year), medium (until 2030) and long term (beyond 2030) for two science-based scenarios - below 2 o C (aligned with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-2.6) and exceeding 4 o C (aligned with SSP5-8.5).\n\nWe continue using MSCI's Climate Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to assess our portfolio exposure to climate risks. We assess physical risks based on the location of assets and their exposure to individual hazards as a consequence of climate change. The VaR represents the combined discounted physical risks costs (extreme cold, extreme heat, /flooding, windstorms, tropical cyclones and wild/fire) based on probable change in physical climate risks to the year 2100 expressed as a percentage of the portfolio's value.\n\nWe assess transition risks based on alignment of assets to relevant regulations (e.g. Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standards (MEES)) and market demand.\n\nBased on the risks identi/fied in our scenario analysis, and following our Group risk management framework and methodology, we have assessed these for:\n\n## Likelihood\n\nLow: <10%\n\nHigh: >20%\n\n## Financial impact\n\nLow: <\u00a35m P&L / <\u00a3150m Capital High: >\u00a315m P&L / >\u00a3500m Capital\n\n## Reputational impact\n\nLow: minor reputational impact High: signi/ficant impact leading to loss of trust in the company\n\nWe have identi/fied and assessed risks across all areas of our business, including investments, divestments, development and operations. Mitigation of these risks is discussed in the section below.\n\nOur assessment concluded that our current portfolio is not highly exposed to physical risks given the location of our assets, and the impact of physical risks to our portfolio will only become more relevant in the long term, under a >4\u00baC scenario. Conversely, transition risks are material in the short and medium term as we expect increasing mitigation to reduce emissions, such as policy and regulation changes. Alongside this, there is an opportunity for us to bene/fit from increasing customer and investor demand for green, low-carbon buildings.\n\n## IMPACT OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES ON OUR STRATEGY\n\nWe are addressing these risks and opportunities through three priorities, all critical elements of our approach to sustainability - Build well, Live well, Act well:\n\n- ' Decarbonising our portfolio\n- ' Developing net zero carbon buildings\n- ' Building resilience to a changing climate\n\n## Decarbonising our portfolio\n\nWe will achieve net zero carbon across our value chain by 2040. This commitment has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and includes a near-term target to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline, and a long-term target to reduce our absolute emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019/20 baseline.\n\nThrough our \u00a3135m Net Zero Transition Investment Plan (NZTIP), launched in 2021, we are ensuring we meet our near-term science-based target and stay ahead of impending 2030 MEES requirements of minimum EPC B. To date we have committed \u00a38.2m of expenditure. We will recover a portion of this investment through the service charge as part of the normal process of life-cycle replacement. We also expect to derive energy e/fficiency bene/fits and related cost savings as a result. We provide further details on the progress of our NZTIP and science-based target on pages 28-29.\n\nWe continue to operate our buildings in accordance with our company-wide environmental and energy management system, which is certi/fied to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001, having energy reduction plans (ERPs) and action plans for all our assets, which outline how we will reduce the energy use and carbon emissions of each asset e/ffectively. The ERPs form part of the operational /financial planning for each asset.\n\nAs we continue to build relationships with our suppliers, the climate-related information they provide (such as carbon emissions, energy consumption and relevant climaterelated targets) allows us to better understand their operations and prioritise future engagement activity.\n\n## POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n## Income statement\n\nResearch shows buildings that have high sustainability credentials attract higher average rents, improving leasing and occupancy rates. Improved energy e/fficiency should also improve service charges payable by tenants.\n\nConversely, older, less sustainable assets will ultimately see longer voids for retro/fits and a loss of rental income where they do not meet the minimum EPC requirements.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nThrough our \u00a3135m NZTIP, we are electrifying heating and improving energy e/fficiency across the portfolio, improving the capital value of the a/ffected assets, which have shown more resilience to yield pressures than assets without a clear ESG strategy. This is demonstrated by the CBRE Sustainability Index, which shows a more resilient total property return for energy e/fficient assets, including a 90bps gap in ERV growth compared with ine/fficient ones.\n\nThe NZTIP is considered in our asset valuations, alongside expected uplift in ERVs. The cost of our NZTIP will /fluctuate over the next 6 years as we account for changes in in/flation and portfolio composition with the expenditure pro/file weighted to 2024/25 and 2025/26.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW WE ARE DECARBONISING OUR PORTFOLIO VISIT OUR WEBSITE",

This commitment forms a key part of our Sustainable Development Toolkit - a comprehensive guide for our development teams and external partners to ensure they consider sustainability throughout the life-cycle of our schemes, and that it is a key consideration in our gateway approval process.\n\nFor each development, we aim to reduce emissions associated with construction by exploring structural retention and material reuse, adopting e/fficient design and modern methods of construction, and specifying low-carbon materials, ensuring we balance upfront carbon with whole-life carbon, to ensure our design decisions do not negatively a/ffect the longer-term operational and maintenance carbon emissions of our assets.\n\nWe set energy-use intensity (EUI) targets for each development, modelling the design to optimise operational energy e/fficiency. Developments are also designed to be 100% electric and target maximum use of on-site renewables as possible.\n\n## POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n## Income statement\n\nStrong and increasing market demand for net zero properties, especially in the o/ffice market, is outstripping supply, which is likely to lead to rent and value premiums for these assets.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nIncreased demand for low-carbon materials, many of which are still nascent markets, could increase the construction costs of our development pipeline.\n\nThe cost of reducing upfront embodied carbon on developments is highly dependent on the strategy adopted. We are modelling this across our live developments and are /finding that retention on one project saves 2.8% on Total Development Cost (TDC) whereas relying on low-carbon materials increases TDC by 1.8% on a di/fferent project.\n\nWe issued a \u00a3400m Green Bond in March 2023 to fund the development of green buildings as detailed below.\n\n## Building resilience to a changing climate\n\nAlthough we assessed that our current portfolio is not highly exposed to physical risks given the location of our assets, we still act to mitigate these risks through physical measures, insurance and businesscontinuity planning.\n\nIn our development pipeline, we are designing and constructing high-quality buildings and spaces capable of achieving operational resilience over their lifetime, considering how the UK's climate will change in the coming decades. We manage the impact of physical risks, such as higher cooling costs and lower heating demand, by adapting building services design, reducing heating capacity and maintaining summer cooling capacity to cope with heatwaves. The performance of our fa\u00e7ade and fabric materials is designed to address the expected higher temperatures by minimising energy demand, as well as to withstand extreme temperatures and increased wind speeds, to avoid maintenance issues or damage to buildings in future. We target operational energy intensities in line with industry net zero carbon benchmarks, wherever available. Our drainage strategies are designed to mitigate foreseen rain levels and /flood risks using physical and nature-based solutions. As detailed in our nature strategy, Let Nature In, we consider nature-based solutions for reducing energy use and adapting to future climate scenarios such as fa\u00e7ade and rooftop greening, sustainable urban drainage and permeable surfaces.\n\nAcross our operational portfolio, assets in areas highly exposed to physical risks have developed plans to ensure they have adequate protection and mitigation, including business-continuity and emergencyresponse plans. These mitigation actions and our appropriate risk management practices also help us to reduce the risk of increase in insurance premiums related to climate risks.\n\nOur Responsible Property Investment Policy details how we assess climate risks during the sale and acquisition of assets. We conduct thorough due diligence, understanding the asset's performance metrics, including energy consumption, EPCs and other sustainability credentials, and assessing /flood risk and embodied carbon, and we work with MSCI to use their Climate Risk Due Diligence Analysis platform for acquisitions.\n\n## POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT\n\n## Income statement\n\nThe changing environment has direct cost implications, especially for assets located in highrisk /flood zones (4.5% VaR at >4 o C scenario) due to potential cost of repairs, cost of business interruption and increased insurance costs. Additionally, there may be cost implications for the built environment to be included in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme resulting in carbon taxes and increased energy costs to counteract more extreme seasonal trends.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nIncreased capital investment to maintain compliance with legal requirements, such as improving EPC ratings across the portfolio, and also to protect our assets at risk from physical climate change. Failure to do so would negatively a/ffect the long-term capital values of these assets.\n\nTo support our strategy, in March 2023 we published our updated Green Financing Framework and issued our inaugural \u00a3400m Green Bond, due 2034. All net proceeds from this bond have been fully allocated to four eligible green projects, within the category Green Buildings - Construction of new developments, including The Forge, n2, Lucent and Timber Square.

This is consistent with the Group's going concern and viability assessment.\n\nWe recognise our strategy and adaptation measures may need to evolve in the long term, particularly under a >4 o C scenario. In this scenario, changes to our strategy and /financial planning are likely to be required, including divestment of assets that are less resilient to extreme heat and rainfall, or investment in infrastructure to limit the impact of /flooding and coastal surge. This scenario could also result in changes to our customers' and supply chain partners' businesses, including business failures, or supply chain disruption. We would need increased due diligence in supply chain selection, particularly considering the sourcing",

We identify, assess and manage climate-related risks through the framework - with the risks clearly de/fined and owned. We score risks on a gross and net basis, following evaluation of the mitigating controls in place, as described in the Managing Risk section on pages 38-40. Furthermore, Landsec has de/fined its appetite for each risk, including climate-related risks, and this is overlaid when considering any residual risks.\n\nAs part of its overall responsibility for risk, the Board undertakes an annual assessment, taking account of risks that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, as well as the Group's strategic objectives. We use scenariomodelling, including the climate scenario analysis described above, to better understand the impact of these risks on our business model when placed under varying degrees of stress, enabling us to consider interdependencies and test plausible mitigation plans.\n\nThe primary responsibility for, and management of, each risk is assigned to a speci/fic member of the ELT, who is accountable for ensuring the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal control systems and for implementing key risk mitigation plans. Risks are also assigned a secondary owner - usually a Senior Leader - who is responsible for ensuring we mitigate the risk appropriately.\n\nThe primary responsibility for climate risk sits with our Managing Director, Corporate A/ffairs & Sustainability, with the Head of ESG and Sustainability having secondary responsibility. Our climate change principal risk includes both transition and physical climate risks as detailed above, and is monitored quarterly using a series of key risk indicators as detailed in the metrics and targets section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ADDRESS OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE, IS DETAILED FURTHER ON PAGES 38-45\n\n## METRICS AND TARGETS\n\n## TARGETS\n\nTo address climate change risks, we have set ambitious climate-related targets - the headlines of which are summarised below:\n\n## DECARBONISING OUR PORTFOLIO\n\nAchieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the value chain by 2040 from a 2019/20 baseline\n\nNear-term target: Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline\n\nLong-term target: Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019/20 baseline 1\n\nReduce energy intensity by 52% by 2030 from a 2019/20 baseline\n\nSource 85% of total energy (electricity, gas, heating and cooling) consumption from renewable sources by 2030\n\n## DEVELOPING NET ZERO CARBON BUILDINGS\n\nReduce upfront embodied carbon across our developments by 50% compared with a typical building 2 , by 2030\n\n## BUILDING RESILIENCE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nEnsure all assets in areas highly exposed to climate risks have adaption measures in place\n\n- 1.

Whilst our approach is well-established, we are continuously reviewing our risk management procedures to ensure that they are /fit for purpose, as our business, and the environment we operate in, evolve. Working to further embed our risk management practices has therefore been a key priority during 2023/24, and it will continue to be a priority as we move into 2024/25 and beyond.\n\nThe key components and stakeholders of our risk management framework are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board: accountable and have overall responsibility for overseeing risk and ensuring that a robust risk management and internal control system is in place and operating\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee: responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal control system during the year\n- \u00b7 The Executive Leadership Team: responsible for day-to-day monitoring and management of the Group-wide principal risks, ensuring that a consolidated view of the key risks is formed to inform their prioritisation\n- \u00b7 Workplace and Lifestyle Boards and Excos: monitoring and managing the speci/fic risks relevant to their business areas, as well as ensuring there is appropriate reporting upwards on the status and implications of key risks\n- \u00b7 Risk owners: accountable for the day-today management, tracking and reporting of the individual risks within their respective areas\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Champions: Individuals with responsibility to advocate e/ffective risk management practices within each of their respective business areas and to support risk owners\n- \u00b7 The Head of Risk and Controls: A central role to manage the framework itself, providing support to risk owners, Risk Champions and others throughout the business, and to act as coordinator and interface between the top-down and bottom-up approaches\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nTaking risk is an essential and inherent part of operating any business. As such, Landsec's risk management strategy is not to eliminate all risk but to ensure that appropriate strategies are in place to identify, evaluate and manage the key risks we face. It is therefore essential that our appetite for risk is appropriately considered across each of our risk categories, so that we understand the level or risk we are willing to take, in the drive to reap the associated rewards.\n\nThe Board is responsible for de/fining the risk appetite of the Group, and ensuring it remains in line with our strategy. Landsec's risk appetite di/ffers for each risk, however 'rule of thumb' principles apply, with a minimalist appetite for legal and compliance related risks, a cautious appetite for operational risks and a /flexible appetite for strategic risks. The risk appetite re/flects Landsec's risk management philosophy and determines the extent to which risk is managed or monitored for changes. To embed risk appetite e/ffectively in the business we have established key risk indicators associated with each risk and set limits that are aligned to our appetite. Scenario planning also assists in setting these thresholds.",

During these processes, the Board undertakes an assessment of risks that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, or the Group's strategic objectives. We use scenario-modelling to better understand the impact of these risks on our business model when it is placed under varying degrees of stress, enabling us to consider interdependencies and test plausible mitigation plans. Senior management, teams and stakeholders across the business input into these processes, supported by the Head of Risk and Controls, to identify the strategic, operational, and legal and compliance risks facing each area of our business, alongside the required mitigations.\n\nEach of the key risks are scored using a risk scoring matrix, which rates risk according to the likelihood of the risk materialising, as well as its potential impact. When we evaluate risk, we /first consider the inherent risk (before any mitigating action), followed by the residual risk (after mitigating actions and controls). The di/fference between the inherent risk and residual risk score gives us visibility as to the extent to which we are able to control the risk. From the ratings, we identify principal risks (current risks with relatively high impact and probability). We also track emerging risks (risks where the extent and implications are not yet fully understood or are increasing over time). We track these risks by monitoring the velocity of change in the risk score.\n\nThe risk waterfall on page 41 outlines the principal risks faced by Landsec, also showing the appetite for these risks, as well as the inherent and residual risk ratings. However, Landsec also maintains a number of risk registers, including the Group Risk Register, which includes Landsec's Principal Risks. The Audit Committee reviews our Principal Risks at least twice a year, before presenting them to the Board for review and inclusion within external reporting.\n\n## MANAGEMENT AND ASSURANCE OF RISKS\n\nLandsec operates a Three Lines of Defence ('3LoD') risk model in respect of structuring risk management and assurance activities. The First Line of Defence are the risk and control owners, who are responsible for the day-to-day ownership and management of their respective risks. These individuals are also responsible for ensuring any control mechanisms they have in place to manage risks are operating e/ffectively. For the Principal Risks, each of the risks are assigned to individual members of the Executive Leadership Team.\n\nThe Second Line of Defence includes the risk and compliance functions at Landsec, which set the policies and standards to be met by the business in relation to risk management, as well as the internal assurance systems designed to challenge the business to ensure that risks are e/ffectively being managed. This includes forums such as Executive Leadership Team meetings, Workplace and Lifestyle Boards and Excos and other management teams. The principal operational risks, including health and security, and information security and cyber threat are managed by dedicated second-line functions that de/fine and implement policy and mitigating controls, and undertake assurance activities.\n\nIn addition, the Head of Risk and Controls manages Landsec's Key Controls Toolkit. The Toolkit is a set of clearly de/fined controls that are self-certi/fied by control owners within the business, to provide ongoing assurance and coverage of key risk areas. The Audit Committee monitors the results of this process. This supports the Committee's evaluation of the control environment and the adequacy of assurance activity. The Committee also receives a summary report at each meeting, describing key second and third-line assurance activities, including internal audits, actions agreed and the status of open risk mitigation actions.\n\nLandsec's Third Line of Defence is predominantly delivered through the provision of Internal Audit, which provides independent assurance over key controls and processes to management and the Audit Committee. An annual planning exercise is carried out to identify the areas for inclusion on a risk basis, including the areas where the impact of controls is greatest i.e. where there is a relatively high inherent risk and relatively low residual risk. This helps to focus the work of Internal Audit and other assurance providers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT ON PAGES 62-69",

During the year, we have reviewed the ten principal risks and re-categorised them according to their current strategic and operational focus. As a result, we have /five strategic and /five operational risks. The strategic risks relate to the macro-economic environment; our key markets - o/ffice and retail; capital allocation; and development. The operational risks are cyber threat; change projects; health and safety; people and skills; and climate change.\n\nOur principal risks are re/flected in the risk waterfall below. The risk waterfall allows us to show the gross risk score (without mitigations applied) alongside the net risk scores (the rating following consideration of the mitigations in place). These scores for both gross and net risk score are calculated as a function of impact and likelihood.\n\nThe box on each risk re/flects the Group's risk appetite for these risks. The appetite range is a view which outlines the desired risk the Group wishes to take in respect of each risk. Appetite ranges are: 'Open' (where we are focused on maximising opportunities);\n\n'Flexible' (willing to consider all options); 'Cautious' (where we are willing to tolerate a degree of risk); 'Minimalist' (preferring options with low inherent risk); and 'Averse' (where we avoid risk and uncertainty).\n\nWhere the net risk sits within the appetite box, the risk is considered to be managed within appetite. At year end, there are no net risks currently above appetite, though some are below. The tables on the following pages describe each principal risk in detail, including mitigating controls, KRIs and changes in the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group's going concern assessment considers changes in the Group's principal risks (see pages 41-45) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our /financial performance and continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group's secured debt structure within its /financial covenants, which are described in note 22.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed base case, downside and reverse stress test models, as well as a cash /flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic assumptions on the Group's operating environment (the 'mitigated downside scenario'). This mitigated downside scenario re/flects unfavourable macroeconomic conditions, and a deterioration in our ability to collect rent and service charge from our customers and removes uncommitted capital expenditure, acquisitions, disposals and developments.\n\nThe Group's key metrics from the mitigated downside scenario as at the end of the going concern assessment period, which covers the 16 months to 30 September 2025, are shown below alongside the actual position at 31 March 2024.\n\n| KEY METRICS                    | 31 March 2024   | TABLE 17 Mitigated  downside  scenario 30 September  2025   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV             | 37.0%           | 42.8%                                                       |\n| Adjusted net debt              | \u00a33,517m         | \u00a33,885m                                                     |\n| EPRA net tangible  assets      | \u00a36,398m         | \u00a35,559m                                                     |\n| Available /financial  headroom | \u00a31.9bn          | \u00a30.9bn                                                      |\n\nIn our mitigated downside scenario, the Group has su/fficient cash reserves, with our Security Group LTV ratio remaining less than 65% and interest cover above 1.45x, for a period of 16 months from the date of authorisation of these /financial statements. Under this scenario, the Security Group's asset values would need to fall by a further 34% from the sensitised values forecasted at 30 September 2025 to be non-compliant with the LTV covenant. This equates to a 43% fall in the value of the Security Group's assets from the 31 March 2024 values for the LTV to reach 65%. The Directors consider the likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote.\n\nThe Security Group also requires earnings before interest of at least \u00a3198m in the full year ending 31 March 2025 and at least \u00a3232m in the full year ending 31 March 2026 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the mitigated downside scenario, which would ensure compliance with the Group's covenant through to the end of the going concern assessment period. Security Group earnings post year end 31 March 2024 are above the level required to meet the interest cover covenant for the year ended 31 March 2025. The Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security Group earnings over the period ending 30 September 2025 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant.\n\nThe Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received, to determine\n\nwhen our available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, although breaching the interest cover covenant, the Group continues to have su/fficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the /financial statements of the Group and parent for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\n## VIABILITY STATEMENT THE VIABILITY ASSESSMENT PERIOD\n\nThe Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a /five-year period to March 2029, taking account of the Group's current /financial position and the potential impact of our principal risks.\n\n## PROCESS\n\nOur /financial planning process comprises a budget for two /financial years and the strategic plan. Generally, the budget has a greater level of certainty and is used to set near-term targets across the Group. The strategic plan is less certain than the budget but provides a longer-term outlook against which strategic decisions can be made.\n\nThe /financial planning process considers the Group's pro/fitability, capital values, gearing, cash /flows and other key /financial metrics re/flecting conservative adjustments to the strategic plan over the plan period. These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, in which a number of the main underlying assumptions are /flexed and tested to consider alternative macro-economic environments. Additionally, the Group also considers the impact of potential structural changes to the business in light of varying economic conditions, such as signi/ficant additional sales and acquisitions or re/financing. These assumptions are then adapted further to",

While the assumptions we have applied in these scenarios are possible, they do not represent our view of the likely outturn. The Directors have also considered reverse stress-test\n\n## PRINCIPAL RISK\n\n## VIABILITY SCENARIO ASSUMPTION\n\n## Macroeconomic outlook\n\nChanges in the macroeconomic environment result in reduction in demand for space or deferral of decisions by retail and o/ffice occupiers.\n\nDue to the length of build projects, the prevailing economic climate at initiation may be vastly di/fferent from that at completion.\n\n## O/ffice occupier market\n\nStructural changes in customer expectations leading to changes in demand for o/ffice space and the consequent impact on income and asset values. Further, the risk encompasses the inability to identify or adapt to changing markets in a timely manner.\n\n## Retail and hospitality occupier market\n\nStructural changes in customer expectations leading to changes in demand for retail or hospitality space and the consequent impact on income and asset values.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nCapital allocated to speci/fic assets, sectors or locations does not yield the expected returns i.e. we are not e/ffective in placing capital or recycling.\n\n## Development strategy\n\nWe may be unable to generate expected returns as a result of changes in the occupier market for a given asset during the course of the development, or cost or time overruns on the scheme.\n\n- \u00b7 Declines in capital values and outward yield movements across all assets within the portfolio\n- \u00b7 Additional impact of a higher in/flationary market captured within costs\n- \u00b7 No issuance of additional /fixed term bonds through the assessment period\n- \u00b7 Additional impact of increased interest rates on servicing debt\n- \u00b7 Reduced demand leads to increased void periods, negative valuation movements and downward pressure on rental values over the whole assessment period\n- \u00b7 Increased customer failures lead to increased void periods, negative valuation movements and downward pressure on rental values over the period\n- \u00b7 Capital that is accretive to the portfolio but not essential has been removed\n- \u00b7  Any uncommitted budgeted acquisitions, disposals and developments do not take place due to reduced liquidity\n- \u00b7 A reduction in recognised development pro/fits for committed schemes that will continue to be advanced over the viability assessment period\n\nWe considered our other Principal Risks, including climate change transition, and their possible impact on our assessment of the Group's viability. We concurred that as we have fully costed and committed to invest \u00a3135m to achieve our science-based target by 2030, this mitigated the climate change transition risk su/fficiently.\n\n## IMPACT ON KEY METRICS\n\nWe have assessed the impact of these assumptions on the Group's key /financial metrics over the assessment period, including pro/fitability, net debt, loan-to-value ratios and available /financial headroom.\n\nThe viability scenario represents a contraction in the size of the business over the /five-year period considered, with the Security Group LTV at 49.5% in March 2029, its highest point in the assessment period. The Group maintains a positive /financial headroom from March 2024 through to September 2025 and the Group will only be required to secure new funding from March 2026. The Directors expect the Group to be able to secure new funding, given the strong relationships and engagement the Group has with its existing banking group and on the basis of the recent bond issuances in March 2023 and March 2024 that were well supported by investors.\n\n| KEY METRICS                         | Actuals 31 March 2024   | TABLE 18 Mitigated  downside  scenario 31 March 2029   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV                  | 37.0%                   | 49.5%                                                  |\n| Adjusted net debt                   | \u00a33,517m                 | \u00a34,016m                                                |\n| EPRA net tangible  assets per share | 859p                    | 655p                                                   |\n| Available /financial  headroom      | \u00a31.9bn                  | (\u00a32.3bn)                                               |\n\n## CONFIRMATION OF VIABILITY\n\nBased on this assessment the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2029.\n\nscenarios including one in which we are unable to collect any rent for an extended period of time.

As a result, we have welcomed James Bowling as our new Audit Committee Chair in September 2023 and Moni Mannings who joined the Board in December 2023 and became Senior Independent Director in April 2024. We continue to review and evolve our skills matrix to ensure we have the skills needed on our Board.\n\nWe remain committed to having a Board that is diverse in all respects. As at the date of this report we comply with the Listing Rules requirements relating to diversity: (i) 40% of our Board are women, (also meeting the FTSE Women Leaders target); (ii) two of our senior Board roles are held by women (CFO and SID); and (iii) we have two directors on the Board from minority ethnic backgrounds (also meeting Parker Review targets). During the year we approved a Board Diversity Policy. Importantly, across the wider business, we made progress against our diversity targets (see pages 26-27), but in order that diversity and inclusion remains a key priority we are going to include it in our executive incentive programmes from 2024/25 onwards (see page 71).\n\n## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nLandsec's success is dependent on the Board taking decisions for the bene/fit of our shareholders and in doing so having regard to all our stakeholders.\n\nEach year we write to our larger shareholders, o/ffering them the opportunity to meet privately and discuss their thoughts on the\n\nAs Chair of Landsec, I'm pleased to present our Corporate Governance Report. During the year our Board has continued to advance the long-term, sustainable success of the Company. Our e/ffective governance processes underpin Board activities and ensure we e/ffectively consider the risks, uncertainties and opportunities the business faces.\n\n## THE YEAR IN REVIEW\n\nIn 2023/24, the Board continued to address challenges arising from macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including the e/ffects of increased in/flation and interest rates on property values. The increased cost of capital and capital allocation more broadly was a signi/ficant consideration. These external factors continued to shape our discussions throughout the year, guiding decisions that sought to prioritise the Company's best interests in both the short and long term.\n\nDespite these challenges, we achieved another year of robust operational performance. This success is a result of the focus on our three key competitive advantages: our high quality portfolio; the strength of our customer relationships; and our ability to unlock complex opportunities.\n\n## BOARD SUCCESSION AND DIVERSITY\n\nThe Board and Nomination Committee have continued to focus on succession planning and Board composition.\n\nDuring the year, as well the retirement of Cressida Hogg, and my transition to Chair on 16 May 2023, we announced other changes to the Board. Nicholas Cadbury, our Audit Committee Chair, left the Board\n\nCompany and the wider market with the Chair or the Senior Independent Director. Since this was my /first year as Chair I had a number of these meetings and valuable feedback from those meetings was discussed by the Board. Our stakeholder engagement activity is described in more detail on pages 22-24.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThe Board understands the importance of culture and setting the tone of the organisation from the top and embedding it throughout Landsec. Our culture is a key component for continuing to make progress with our strategic plans. The aim of our people strategy is to create a high-performing and inclusive culture. During the year the Board has monitored our culture with regular updates from our Chief People O/fficer on our people, our culture, talent and succession planning, diversity and inclusion activities and engagement survey, and direct engagement activities with the workforce.\n\n## BOARD EVALUATION\n\nThis year our Board evaluation was carried out internally. The Board was satis/fied with its own performance, with all Board members rating performance as good or excellent. For more detail see page 61.\n\n## UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nIn respect of the year ended 31 March 2024 Landsec was subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the 'Code', available from frc.org.uk). The Board is pleased to con/firm that Landsec applied the principles and complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout the year. We are also preparing for the changes required under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2024.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to recognise the hard work and commitment of all our people during the year and to thank them for their continued e/fforts to ensure the future success of the business. I would also like to conclude by thanking members of the Board for their continued support and commitment over the past year.\n\nSIR IAN CHESHIRE, CHAIR\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are supported by our Executive Leadership Team, which is responsible for oversight of strategy, organisational health and the Group's people agenda. Our governance model is centred around our two di/fferent business areas: (i) our Workplace Board and Executive Committee cover our o/ffice activity; and (ii) our Lifestyle Board together with the Retail and Landsec U+I Executive Committees cover the retail and mixed-use business areas.\n\nDecisions that can only be made by the Board, together with the terms of reference for our Board Committees are on our website. Our Delegation of Authorities framework sets out levels of authority for decision making throughout the business. Decision-making on investments and commercial agreements, including the acquisition, disposal and development of assets, is delegated according to /financial values. Our investment appraisal guidelines include the principles in Section 172 of the Companies Act requiring consideration of all stakeholders.\n\n## OUR NEW SHADOW BOARDS\n\nIn 2023, we established two Shadow Boards, which shadow our Workplace and Lifestyle Boards. These Shadow Boards are made up of employees who participate in shadow board meetings and then formal Workplace and Lifestyle Board meetings to provide new perspectives and ideas and to gain experience in board procedures and board level decision-making. The Shadow Boards do not have formal authority inside the organisation.\n\nWe established our Shadow Boards to help us make better decisions by broadening our current community of decision-makers to ensure wider diversity of thought, and to create impactful career-development opportunities to help our future industry leaders realise their potential. This builds new skill-sets for the members, and provides a forum to challenge the status quo and consider diverse perspectives. This will help ensure the long-term quality and success of our business, so we can continue to lead the industry in making sure we best represent the customers and places we serve.\n\nApplications for the Shadow Board positions were open to all Landsec colleagues, from\n\n## STRATEGY DAY\n\nThe Board strategy day which took place in January 2024 was focused on mixed-use developments and included a tour of the successful Kings Cross mixed-use project, presentations on mixed-use market themes and dynamics and speci/fic discussions on Landsec's mixed-use portfolio.\n\n## TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nDirectors received regular market updates in their Board papers, facilitating greater awareness and understanding of the context of the Group's business and strategy. The Board also received a detailed brie/fing on the Group's new nature strategy which was launched during the year. Details of all of the activities undertaken by the Board are in the table on page 59.\n\n## INDUCTION\n\nOur induction plan is delivered on appointment and aims to enable a new Director to assume their responsibilities as quickly as possible and feel able to contribute to business and strategy discussions, with su/fficient knowledge to provide e/ffective challenge.\n\nThe process also revealed many candidates who demonstrated potential, allowing us to put some others forward for alternative opportunities, or help guide and mentor their career ambitions.\n\nThe Shadow Boards meet formally six times a year, in advance of the respective Lifestyle and Workplace Board meetings, to review, discuss and agree papers and recommendations. They receive the same board papers as the Boards they shadow, and are supported by the MDs of Landsec U+I, Retail and Workplace. They discuss matters amongst themselves before appointing two representatives to attend the Board meetings, in rotation, to represent each Shadow Board's collective perspectives.\n\nThe Shadow Boards have also met separately in early 2024 with two Nonexecutive Directors to provide their feedback on the Shadow Board experience and gain insights from our Non-executives on working at PLC Board level. At both sessions feedback provided was overwhelmingly positive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ATTENDANCE\n\nThere were seven scheduled meetings this year. All Board members attended those meetings. The Chair held meetings with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors present at the end of every scheduled Board meeting.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES\n\nOur Board is responsible for the overall leadership of the Group and throughout the year, Board activities and discussion have continued to focus on the Company's strategic priorities. The Board oversees the Company's strategic direction and supports the ELT with its delivery of the strategy within a transparent governance framework. Alongside the strategic priorities and business /financial and operational performance, the Board has considered topics including executive succession, diversity and inclusion, data and technology, compliance and governance. Further detail on these topics is set out on page 59.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKEY STAKEHOLDERS ARE CONSIDERED IN DECISION MAKING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 172 OF THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 (SEE PAGES 22-24 )\n\nany business area or enabling function, no matter what stage of their career.\n\nNearly 80 Landsec colleagues applied for these roles, using a written application form. An interview with a selection panel followed for those shortlisted. The panel was formed of ELT, People team and A/ffinity network members. The main considerations for the selection panel were to ensure candidates had a clear interest in matters of strategic signi/ficance to Landsec and the wider real estate industry, as well as the desire to contribute to decision-making at Board level and the capacity to take on the role.\n\nOf the applicants, we selected ten for their attitude, skill-set, experience and potential - /five for the Lifestyle Board and /five for the Workplace Board. As a result the Shadow Boards comprise colleagues from diverse areas including operations, communications, /finance, development, leasing, procurement and project management. The members underwent formal training involving mentoring, meeting management, personal impact and technical training on how to read and understand /financial information.",

James Bowling and Moni Mannings are currently going through their induction schedules.\n\nOur induction programmes for Ian, James and Moni were designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 support their understanding of Landsec's business and /financial position, strategy, culture, risks and opportunities\n- \u00b7 enable a good understanding of our Board processes and dynamics\n- \u00b7 help them form relationships with the Board, the ELT and other key individuals at Landsec and key external advisers\n- \u00b7 help the Directors learn about our business /first hand, by site visits across our retail, workplace and mixed-use portfolio. Ian, Moni and James have all visited or are due to visit our sites in Manchester, Bluewater, Gunwharf Quays, Victoria, Southwark, O2 and Lewisham.\n\nIn our 2023/24 Board evaluation, our Directors rated our in-depth induction programme highly.\n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe Board has a policy to identify and manage Directors' con/flicts or potential con/flicts of interest and will (i) approve any\n\nsuch disclosed con/flicts, and (ii) determine any mitigating actions deemed appropriate to ensure that all Board meetings and decisions are conducted solely with a view to promoting the success of Landsec.\n\nDirectors' con/flicts of interest are reviewed by the Board annually, with new con/flicts arising between meetings dealt with by the Chair and Company Secretary.\n\nDetails of Non-executive Directors' other appointments are included on pages 51-53. Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment set out the time commitments expected from them. Following consideration, the Nomination Committee has concluded that all the Non-executive Directors continue to devote su/fficient time to discharging their duties to the required high standard.\n\nWe generally adhere to the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) proxy voting guidelines on overboarding and accordingly deem all of our Non-executive Directors to be within these guidelines.\n\nOur policy is to allow Executive Directors to take one non-executive directorship at another FTSE company, subject to Board approval. During the year, Vanessa Simms disclosed that she had resigned from Drax Group plc and would take on a non-executive role at Rotork plc, with both changes being e/ffective from June 2024. The Board considered this change and was satis/fied\n\nthat Vanessa's time commitment to her role would not be impacted.\n\n## BOARD DIVERSITY\n\nDuring the year the Board formally adopted a Board Diversity Policy (available on our website). This Policy sets out the speci/fic responsibilities of the Board in relation to the diversity of its membership and its role in setting a culture of inclusive leadership from the top.\n\nOur latest gender and ethnic diversity data at Board level and below as required under the Listing Rules is detailed below. Further diversity data for the wider workforce is on pages 26-27 and in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\nLandsec was pleased to be ranked 16th in the FTSE Women Leaders Review published in 2024. The Board acknowledges the need to make more progress on ethnic diversity below Board level and has set a target of 9% ethnic diversity in our senior leadership population by 2027 as required under the Parker Review. We have 2030 targets for gender and ethnic diversity which are available on our website. To ensure the Group is working towards these targets, diversity and inclusion measures are being included in our executive bonus and longterm incentive plans for the /first time this year (see page 71).\n\n| BOARD AND EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP DIVERSITY 1                     | Number of  Board members   | Percentage of the Board   | Number of  senior  positions on  the Board  (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)   | Number in  Executive  Leadership  Team   | TABLE 21 Percentage  of Executive  Leadership  Team   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gender diversity                                               |                            |                           |                                                                         |                                          |                                                       |\n| Men                                                            | 6                          | 60%                       | 2                                                                       | 6                                        | 60%                                                   |\n| Women                                                          | 4                          | 40%                       | 2                                                                       | 4                                        | 40%                                                   |\n| Not speci/fied/prefer not to say                               | -                          | -                         | -                                                                       | -                                        | -                                                     |\n| Ethnic diversity                                               |                            |                           |                                                                         |                                          |                                                       |\n| White British or other White (including minority-white groups) | 8                          | 80%                       | 3                                                                       | 9                                        | 90%                                                   |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                   | -                          | -                         | -                                                                       | -                                        | -                                                     |\n| Asian/Asian British                                            | 2                          | 20%                       | 1                                                                       | 1                                        | 10%                                                   |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                          | -                          | -                         | -                                                                       | -                                        | -                                                     |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                             | -                          | -                         | -                                                                       | -                                        | -                                                     |\n| Not speci/fied/prefer not to say                               | -                          | -                         | -                                                                       | -                                        | -                                                     |\n\n- 1.

This year, we announced the retirement of our Audit Committee Chair and Senior Independent Director. As a result, the Committee has run two selection processes for new Non-executive Directors, which are described further below.\n\n## BOARD EVOLUTION AND DIVERSITY IN BOARD APPOINTMENTS\n\nA balanced and diverse Board with a mix of skills, expertise, background, and tenure is critical to the success of the Company. The composition of the Board underpins the quality of debate and challenge during discussions.\n\nThe process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for its approval. It is the Nomination Committee's responsibility to keep Board composition under review, including reviewing director independence and tenure. During the year the Committee continued to review the composition and skills of the Board and its plan for Board succession.\n\nThe Nomination Committee works with executive search consultants to ensure they support our approach to diversity in providing a diverse selection of candidates for Board appointments and the selection can then be based upon merit and objective criteria.\n\nThe Board believes that diversity at Board level sets the tone for diversity throughout the business. We promote diversity in the broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also experience, skills, professional background and tenure. During the year, a Board Diversity Policy was approved and this is available on our website.\n\nThe Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse pool of talent being developed at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess and promote this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION ON DIVERSITY AT LANDSEC CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 26-27\n\n## INTERNAL BOARD EVALUATION\n\nWe follow the standard three-yearly cycle for Board evaluations. Our last externally facilitated evaluation was in 2021/22 and the next one will be 2024/25. The evaluations for last year and the current year were therefore undertaken internally, overseen by myself and our Senior Independent Director, using questionnaires and follow up discussion. The process went well and the outcomes are described in more detail in this report.\n\nThis Committee's e/ffectiveness was also assessed as part of the internal review. The Committee was satis/fied with its own e/ffectiveness as a whole and was pleased with the outcome of the Non-executive succession processes.\n\nThe review identi/fied that the skills matrix should continue to be reviewed to ensure we have the right Board composition for the needs of the Company and recent changes to the Board.\n\nSIR IAN CHESHIRE, CHAIR\n\n<!-- image -->",

Nicholas Cadbury and Edward Bonham Carter announced their intention to retire on 31 December 2023 and at our AGM on 11 July 2024 respectively. The Committee appointed an independent search /firm, the Lygon Group ('Lygon'), to recruit additional non-executive directors with Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director experience. Both processes were run by Lygon, who have no other connection to Landsec.\n\nThe /first recruitment process involved a long list and then short list of diverse candidates being considered to replace our Audit Committee Chair. As a result of this robust selection process, James Bowling was appointed on 7 September 2023. James, a Chartered Accountant, was Chief Financial O/fficer of Severn Trent Plc from 2015 until recently retiring from this role. Prior to that, James held senior /financial roles at Shire plc. James is a highly experienced FTSE Chief Financial O/fficer who has successfully transferred his skills across sectors and has broad experience overseeing long-term capital investment models. James succeeded Nicholas as Audit Committee Chair on 18 September 2023 and joined the Nomination Committee on 11 December 2023.\n\nThe second recruitment process which also involved a long and short list of diverse candidates was for a non-executive director to replace our longstanding Senior Independent Director, Edward Bonham Carter. As a result of this selection process, Moni Mannings OBE was appointed to the Board on 11 December 2023, joining this Committee and the Remuneration Committee on the same day and becoming Senior Independent Director on 1 April 2024. Moni is currently an Independent Nonexecutive Director of Hargreaves Lansdown plc, Non-executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee of easyJet plc, Non-executive Director and Senior Independent Director of Co-operative Group and a Member of the Takeover Panel. Moni also founded EPOC, a not-for-pro/fit network that seeks to increase the number of people of colour on boards and is a member of the Parker Review Committee. From 2000 until\n\n2016, Moni was a Partner and Head of the International Banking and Finance Division of Olswang LLP, before which she held senior positions in other leading law /firms. Moni has previously held a number of other non-executive director roles and is a highly experienced and respected City lawyer with extensive property /financing experience. She also brings her experience of being a Senior Independent Director and committee chair from other non-executive roles.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE AND RE-ELECTION TO THE BOARD\n\nThe independence, e/ffectiveness, and commitment of each of the Non-executive Directors has been reviewed by the Committee. The Committee is satis/fied with the contributions and time commitment of all the Non-executive Directors during the year.\n\nThe Committee will always discuss the additional commitments of all directors (including the Chair) before recommending their approval to the Board. It also considers potential con/flict issues as part of that assessment.\n\nJames Bowling and Moni Mannings are standing for initial election by shareholders at the AGM in July 2024, with all other Directors standing for re-election with the support of the Board, with the exception of Edward Bonham Carter who is stepping down from the Board at that time.\n\n## BOARD EVALUATION BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS 2023/24\n\nOur Board evaluation provides the Board and its Committees with an opportunity to re/flect on e/ffectiveness and performance. We carried out the review of the Board's e/ffectiveness internally via questionnaire. The questions focused on key themes and topics which had arisen during the year and areas of focus identi/fied from the evaluation last year.\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\nOverall, the Board was satis/fied with its performance during the year. The following areas were highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7 The Chair had undertaken an extensive induction programme and had been well supported by the Board in getting to know the business during the year\n- \u00b7 There had been good non-executive hires during the year and the induction programmes for new non-executives were highly rated\n- \u00b7 Executive succession planning and talent management was considered to have advanced signi/ficantly under the leadership of the Chief People O/fficer\n- \u00b7 The employee engagement programme for non-executives was viewed positively\n- \u00b7 Board papers had improved\n- \u00b7 Support from the executive and Company Secretary was valued\n- \u00b7 The Board felt it had performed well in the areas of strategy and risk\n- \u00b7 Board culture and relationships between executives and non-executives were viewed positively\n\nKey areas of focus as a result of the evaluation were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board had an excellent employee engagement programme but would bene/fit from spending additional time with ELT and senior leaders\n- \u00b7 Themes identi/fied as a priority for the coming year were: capital allocation in a higher cost of capital environment, strategy execution, unlocking further growth opportunities and succession planning, talent and diversity\n\nThe Board Committees also reviewed and were satis/fied with their own e/ffectiveness. The Audit and Remuneration Committee Reports contain a summary of their own reviews.",

Whilst considering these improvements the Committee has maintained its monitoring of risks throughout the year.\n\nThe ten principal risks have been re-categorised during the year into strategic and operational risks and re/flected in a risk waterfall. Information security and cyber threat, change projects failing to deliver and health and safety are the most signi/ficant operational risks. The Committee has had regular oversight of the signi/ficant work undertaken to mitigate these risks and will continue to consider updates and monitor progress.\n\nAlthough its risk score has decreased during the year, the macroeconomic outlook remains the most signi/ficant strategic risk. The risk management strategy in place to mitigate against this risk includes the regular monitoring of key risk indicators, scenariobased modelling of plausible economic trajectories and extensive research and review of sector and market risks. No emerging risks have been identi/fied through the risk management process.\n\n## CLIMATE RELATED GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Committee has continued to receive updates from the sustainability team and advisers on the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) as well as the Task Force on Naturerelated Financial Disclosure (TNFD), the evolving reporting landscape for climate governance and our approach to climate risk identi/fication, assessment and strategy.\n\nOur disclosures remain consistent with the TCFD recommendations. We are also considering our readiness and response to TNFD recommendations and will continue to monitor these. Our TCFD disclosures can be found on pages 33-37.\n\n## HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nHealth and safety is a key priority of the Board and the Committee continues to support the Board by reviewing the impacts of health and safety measures including the Building Safety Act 2022 and the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC). The Committee is regularly updated on work to assess our liability for any remediation works required and the wider /financial impact arising from such issues and how this is disclosed.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Group's /financial statements are of critical importance to investors and wider stakeholders and the Committee monitors the integrity of the Group's reporting process and /financial management. It scrutinises the full and half-yearly /financial statements before proposing them to the Board for approval. The Committee reviews in detail the work of the external auditor and external valuers and any signi/ficant /financial judgements and estimates made by management to ensure that it is satis/fied with the outcome.",

This is the second year that we have used two valuers, CBRE and JLL, to value the o/ffice and retail portfolios respectively (with some small exceptions). Both CBRE and JLL are industryleading agencies with extensive expertise and appropriate knowledge who provide us with an external valuation of our portfolio twice a year, in accordance with the relevant industry standards. The Committee will be considering in the forthcoming year the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Red Book UK Supplement which includes a mandatory rotation policy for valuers.\n\nThe valuation process requires the valuers to evaluate the likely future /financial performance of each individual asset and apply recent and relevant transactional evidence to determine an appropriate value at the period end. The Committee analyses, challenges and debates the valuations prepared by the valuers who attend Committee meetings for this purpose at the half and full year-end. The external valuation process and the values ascribed to speci/fic assets are also reviewed independently by our auditor, EY, as part of its audit scope.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nLandsec remains on track with its strategy to accelerate growth through recycling capital into higher return opportunities, even though the investment market activity has remained subdued throughout the year. A number of non-core assets have been sold, and Regents Quarter at Kings Cross was acquired. The Committee considered the accounting treatment and disclosures of these transactions and concluded that they were appropriate.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE AND GUIDANCE\n\nThe Committee considered its compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and continues to believe that we have addressed both the spirit and the requirements of each. In addition, the Committee continues to regularly monitor the changes to the new corporate governance regime, and despite the delays to the introduction of the new regime, is well advanced in preparing for its implementation, including /financial and IT controls reviews and an assurance mapping exercise.\n\n## COMMITTEE CHANGES AND EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe internal Board evaluation undertaken during the year indicated that the Committee continues to operate e/ffectively. I would like to take the opportunity to continue to improve the high standards of the Committee set by Nicholas Cadbury during his time as Audit Chair. Myself and the Committee would like to thank Nicholas for his commitment, valued perspective and leadership of the Committee.\n\nI would also like to say thank you for the warm welcome and support from the other members of the Audit Committee, management and the key advisers EY, KPMG, CBRE and JLL during my /first six months as a member and Chair of the Committee.\n\nJAMES BOWLING, CHAIR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBT\n\nThe Committee has continued to closely monitor the cash collections of rents across the whole portfolio together with required provisions. The rent collection statistics are strong at pre-Covid levels. The bad debt provisions have decreased from last year.\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT\n\nKPMG have completed their /first full year as internal auditor and have successfully completed audits on IT Applications, Retail Centre Management, Workforce Planning, The Forge Handover, ESG, Treasury and Cash Management along with monitoring that teams have closed out audit actions from previous reports. This is in line with their Internal Audit Plan for 2022-2024. The Audit Committee has agreed KPMG's proposed Internal Audit Plan for the year ended 31 March 2025 which will include amongst others, internal audits for Data Privacy, Business Continuity Planning and May/field Development.\n\n## FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE\n\nThe Committee considered the Company's 2024 Annual Report in the round and concluded and recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the 2024 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT\n\nThe Committee considers the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements and the going concern statement is set out on pages 46 and 47, along with the viability statement and the rationale behind the chosen /five-year time horizon.",

Following each meeting, the Committee Chair reports on the main discussion points and /findings to the Board.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Board is accountable and has overall responsibility for overseeing risk and ensuring that a robust risk management and internal control system is in place and operating e/ffectively.\n\nAn overview of Landsec's risk management framework and governance, risk appetite, identi/fication of risks, management and assurance of risks, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties are included on pages 38-45. The risk management framework is operated on a Group-wide basis and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the Board's overall responsibility for a robust risk management and internal control system\n- \u00b7 the Committee's review of the e/ffectiveness of that system\n- \u00b7 the Executive Leadership Team's day-today monitoring and management of the Group-wide principal risks\n- \u00b7 embedding of the management of risks throughout the Group via the Workplace and Lifestyle Boards and Executive Committees, and risk owners and champions.\n\nA risk waterfall uses indicators to highlight whether each risk is within our appetite. This allows the Committee to consider whether principal risks are changing and whether the risk appetite remains appropriate.\n\nPrimary responsibility for the operation of the Company's internal control and risk management systems, which extend to include /financial, operational and compliance controls and accord with the FRC's 2014 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting', has been delegated to management and risk and control owners. They are responsible for the management of their respective risks and the associated control mechanisms.\n\nThese risk management and internal control systems have been designed to ensure that appropriate strategies are in place to identify, evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate risk.\n\n## RISK ASSURANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nAs part of the Three Lines of Defence Risk Model (as outlined on pages 39-40), the Committee monitors the results of the key controls process, evaluates the control environment and considers the adequacy of assurance activity. The risk model also includes independent assurance over key controls and processes to management and the Committee via internal audits.\n\nInternal audits are carried out by KPMG in accordance with an agreed annual assurance plan and reviewed by the Committee throughout the year.\n\nKPMG have provided assurance to the Committee on key controls and programme assurance and identi/fied improvements in key /financial processes.\n\nThe key elements of the Group's risk management and internal control systems are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 an embedded decentralised risk management framework supported by Risk Champions\n- \u00b7 a Head of Risk & Controls to manage the risk framework and to provide support on risk and controls matters throughout Landsec\n- \u00b7 an established organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility, approval levels and delegated authorities\n- \u00b7 a disciplined internal governance structure which facilitates regular performance review and decision making\n- \u00b7 a comprehensive strategic and business planning review\n- \u00b7 a robust budgeting, forecasting and /financial reporting process\n- \u00b7 various policies, procedures and guidelines underpinning the development, asset management and /financing operations of the business\n\n- \u00b7 a compliance certi/fication process conducted in relation to the half-yearly and full-year results, and business activities generally\n- \u00b7 a quarterly key controls self-certi/fication by management\n- \u00b7 a focused post-acquisition review and integration programme to ensure the Group's governance, procedures, standards and control environment are implemented e/ffectively and on time\n- \u00b7 a /financial and property information management system\n- \u00b7 a whistleblowing process that enables concerns to be reported con/fidentially and on an anonymous basis and for those concerns to be investigated.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee discusses on a regular basis:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's signi/ficant and emerging risks, and how exposures and appetite have changed during the period, and reviews the principal risks for external reporting purposes\n- \u00b7 the e/ffectiveness of internal processes at mitigating those risks\n- \u00b7 internal audit reports, summary reports of /findings and recommendations from completion of the internal audit plan\n- \u00b7 progress against completion of agreed actions from the internal audit reports.\n\nThe Committee was satis/fied that the system of risk management and internal controls has been e/ffective throughout the year.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR\n\nEY is Landsec's external auditor and is engaged to conduct a statutory audit and express an opinion on the Company's and the Group's /financial statements. A competitive tender was last carried out in 2022 (as EY were approaching being in o/ffice for ten years having performed their /first audit for Landsec for the year end 31 March 2014). Shareholders con/firmed the appointment of EY at our 2023 Annual General Meeting following this competitive tender process.",

If it picks up any information as part of this process, it would report to the Audit Committee anything that it believes the Committee should know in order to ful/fil its duties and responsibilities. As audit partner, Julie Carlyle is authorised to contact the Committee Chair directly at any time to raise any matter of concern.\n\nIn addition to considering the e/ffectiveness of the Committee, the internal Board evaluation also considered the e/ffectiveness of the external audit with the results and recommendations reported to the Committee. This is supported by regular meetings between EY and the CFO and senior /finance team members which have driven continuous improvements to the external audit process.\n\n## AUDIT PLAN\n\nEY presented its proposed audit plan as reviewed by senior management to the Committee for discussion. The audit scope and approach was appropriate with consideration as to the Group's structure and strategy.\n\nThe Committee is keen to ensure that its auditor feels able to challenge management, to provide observations or recommendations to management and the Audit Committee. These matters may be /financial or non/financial and may be based on fact or opinion (including any concern over culture or behaviour).\n\nEY attends each Committee meeting, supported by other meetings held during the year with the Committee or the Committee Chair without management being present. EY can raise any matter of concern to the Committee Chair at any time without going through management. These regular discussions were useful to the Committee but no matters of concern emerged.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. In undertaking its annual assessment, the Committee took into account the UK Ethical Independence Standards.\n\nThe Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 the con/firmation from EY that it maintains appropriate internal safeguards in line with applicable professional standards, together with an explanation of the due diligence process followed to provide such a con/firmation\n- \u00b7 the mitigation actions taken in seeking to safeguard EY's independent status, including the operation of policies designed to regulate the amount of non-audit services provided by EY and the employment of former EY employees\n- \u00b7 the tenure of the audit engagement partner (not being greater than /five years); Julie Carlyle was appointed as EY audit partner to the Group in July 2022\n\n- \u00b7 the internal performance and e/ffectiveness review of EY referred to above.\n\nNo Committee member has any connection with the current auditor.\n\nTaking the above review into account, the Committee concluded that EY remained objective and independent in its role as external auditor.\n\nEY will be appointed for the 31 March 2025 /financial year at this year's Annual General Meeting, subject to shareholder approval.\n\nThe Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the year under review.\n\n## AUDIT FEE\n\nThe audit fees payable to EY for 2023/24 (including the audit of the statutory accounts and the Group's joint ventures) are \u00a32.6m (2022/23: \u00a31.8m). This fee includes \u00a30.5m of fees paid which relate to the audit for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023.\n\n## NON-AUDIT SERVICES\n\nTo help safeguard EY's objectivity and independence, we operate a non-audit services policy that sets out the circumstances and /financial limits within which EY may be permitted to provide certain non-audit services.\n\n## AUDIT VS. NON-AUDIT FEES 2023/24\n\nCHART 22\n\n(INCLUDING THE AUDIT OF THE GROUP'S JOINT VENTURES\n\n13.8% non-audit fees as a ratio to Group audit fee (excluding the audit of the Group's joint ventures).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee monitors compliance with the policy, including the prior approvals required for non-audit services, and approval levels are as follows:\n\n| Per   assignment   (\u00a3)   | TABLE 23          | Aggregate   during the year   (\u00a3)   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 0-25,000                 | <100,000          | Chief  Financial  O/fficer          |\n| 25,000-  100,000         | 100,000- 900,000* | Audit  Committee  Chair             |\n| >100,000                 | >900,000*         | Committee                           |\n\n*50% of the prior year audit fee.\n\nAll approvals are noted at the Audit Committee meetings.\n\nEY was engaged during the year to provide non-audit services to the Group relating to the Company's half-yearly review, the assurance statement on sustainability reporting review, non-statutory audit of the Security Group, work in relation to the update of the bond programme documentation and reporting on the Green bond. The Committee decided that it would be in the interest of the Company to use EY for these services, recognising that the use of audit /firms for non-audit work should generally be kept to a minimum and the services were not considered to impact EY's independence and objectivity. Total fees for non-audit services amounted to \u00a3419,500. Details of the fees charged by EY during the year can be found in note 8 to the /financial statements.\n\nNo non-audit fees were approved or paid on a contingent basis.\n\n## EXTERNAL VALUATIONS AND VALUERS\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio, including properties held within the development programme and in joint arrangements, is undertaken by external valuers. The Group provides input, such as source data, and support to the valuation process. CBRE has been the Company's principal valuer since 2015 and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) was appointed in 2022 as joint valuer to undertake the valuation of a large part of the retail and mixed-use urban portfolio whilst CBRE value the o/ffice portfolio and some of the retail portfolio.\n\nThe Committee was updated on the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Red Book UK Supplement which implements a mandatory rotation policy for valuers and will consider a proposal to comply with this in the coming months.\n\nThe Committee has considered the independence of CBRE and JLL. Both valuers have appropriate systems in place to check for con/flicts of interest and must seek approval for non-valuation activities. Their valuation departments operate separately from other advisory activity, and their valuation remuneration is not linked to other non-valuation work that they undertake.\n\nA /fixed-fee arrangement (subject to adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) is in place with the valuers for the valuation of the Group's properties and, given the importance of their work, we have disclosed the fees paid to them in note 9 to the /financial statements. These fees re/flect the valuers' work on the year-end and half-yearly valuations as well as other work on agency services including investment activity. The total valuation fees paid by the Company to CBRE and JLL during the year represented less than 5% of their total fee income from all clients for the year.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL MATTERS\n\nThe Committee reviewed two signi/ficant /financial matters in connection with the /financial statements, namely the valuation of the Group's property portfolio and revenue recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FURTHER DETAILS ARE SET OUT IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 69\n\nThese items were considered to be signi/ficant, taking into account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management and, in respect of the valuation, the external valuers.\n\nThe valuation helps to determine a signi/ficant part of the Group's total property return and net asset value, which have consequential implications for the Group's reported performance and the level of variable remuneration received by senior management through bonus and long-term incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny of each valuation and the valuer's objectivity and e/ffectiveness represent an important part of the Committee's work.\n\nValuations for the half-year results and full-year results were presented to the Committee by CBRE and JLL. These were reviewed and challenged by the Committee, with reference to each valuer's approach, methodology, valuation basis and underlying property and market assumptions. Other Non-executive Directors attended the full and half-year presentations. The Committee Chair and other members of the Committee also had separate meetings with the valuers' as part of this process to provide an opportunity to test and challenge the valuation outcomes and the principles and evidence used in the determination.\n\nAdditionally, CBRE and JLL met with EY and exchanged information independently of management as part of EY's review of the valuations. EY has experienced chartered surveyors on its team who consider the valuer's quali/fications and assess and challenge the valuation approach, assumptions and judgements made by them. Their audit procedures are targeted at addressing the risks in respect of the valuations and the potential for any undue management in/fluence in arriving at them. This year 37 properties (77% of the portfolio) were identi/fied for substantive review by its valuation experts primarily on the basis of their value, type, risk pro/file, commitments to ESG and location. The Committee reviewed the auditor's /findings.\n\nAn internal evaluation of the valuers' performance and e/ffectiveness was conducted as part of the Committee's internal valuation with the results and recommendations reported to the Committee.",

The Committee debated and discussed these measures and agreed that they were appropriate for the business.\n\n## FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE\n\nThe Committee applied the same due diligence approach adopted in previous years in order to assess whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, one of the key Code requirements. The Committee received assurance from the veri/fication process carried out on the content of the Annual Report to ensure consistent reporting and the existence of appropriate links between key messages and relevant sections of the Annual Report.\n\nTaking the above into account, together with the views expressed by EY, the Committee recommended, and in turn the Board con/firmed, that the 2024 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY\n\nThe Audit Committee provides a regular whistleblowing update to the Board, which has overall responsibility for whistleblowing. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's Speak Up policy which allows employees and third parties to report concerns about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing (whether /financial or otherwise) on a con/fidential basis, and anonymously if preferred. This includes an independent third-party reporting facility comprising a telephone hotline and an alternative online process. Any matters reported are initially investigated by the Head of Governance and Company Secretary and reported to the Audit Committee Chair and Manjiry\n\nTamhane, the Non-executive Director who became responsible for whistleblowing during the year and escalated to the Committee and Board, as appropriate. During the year two whistleblowing incidents were reported. Both matters were investigated and no concerns or action were required following conclusion of the investigation. The matter which was reported close to the last year-end was fully investigated and resulted in some positive recommendations on cyber security and websites which have now been implemented.\n\nWe monitor whistleblowing awareness and remind employees that a dedicated hotline exists should they ever need to 'blow the whistle'. The arrangements also form part of the induction programme for new employees. Details of the whistleblowing hotline are included in our Supply Chain Commitment, Sustainable Development Toolkit, procurement tender documentation, on our website, and at our assets and development sites.",

Although the portfolio valuation is conducted by an external valuer, valuation estimates are inherently subjective and require signi/ficant judgements to be made by management and valuers.\n\nSigni/ficant assumptions and judgements made by the valuer in determining valuations may include the appropriate yield (based on recent market evidence), changes to market rents (ERVs), what will occur at the end of each lease, the level of non-recoverable costs and alternative uses. Development valuations also include assumptions around costs to complete the development, the level of letting at completion, incentives, lease terms and the length of time the space remains void.\n\n## Revenue recognition (including the timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of lease incentives)\n\nCertain transactions require management to make judgements as to whether and to what extent they should be recognised as revenue in the year. Market expectations and EPRA earnings targets may place pressure on management to distort revenue recognition. This may result in overstatement or deferral of revenues to assist in meeting current or future targets or expectations, including through incorrect treatment of lease incentives.\n\nThe Audit Committee adopts a formal approach by which the valuation process, methodology, assumptions and outcomes are reviewed and robustly challenged. This includes separate review and scrutiny by management, the Committee Chair and the Committee itself. The Group uses CBRE and JLL, both leading /firms in the UK property market, as its principal valuers. It also involves EY as the external auditor which is assisted by its own specialist team of chartered surveyors who are familiar with the valuation approach and the UK property market.\n\nEY met with the valuers separately from management and has noted, as part of their procedures, no undue in/fluence being exerted by management in relation to the valuers arriving at their valuations. CBRE and JLL submit their valuation reports to the Committee as part of the half-yearly and full-year results process. Both valuers were asked to attend and present their reports to the Board and to highlight any signi/ficant judgements made or disagreements which existed between them and management. There were no disagreements identi/fied and the valuations were accepted for reporting purposes.\n\nBased on the degree of oversight and challenge applied to the valuation process, the Committee concluded that the valuations had each been conducted appropriately, objectively and in accordance with the valuer's professional standards.\n\nThe Committee and EY considered the main areas of judgement exercised by management in accounting for matters related to revenue recognition, including timing and treatment of rents, incentives, surrender premiums and other property-related revenue.\n\nIn its assessment, the Committee considered all relevant facts, challenged the recoverability of occupier incentives, the options that management had in terms of accounting treatment and the appropriateness of the judgements made by management. These matters had themselves been the subject of prior discussion between EY and management.\n\nThe Committee, having considered the views of EY, concurred with the judgements made by management and was satis/fied that the revenue reported for the year had been appropriately recognised.\n\nThe above description of the signi/ficant /financial matters should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor's Report on pages 96-104 and the signi/ficant accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.",

As the Committee considers that the existing approach to Directors' remuneration remains appropriate for Landsec, only one minor change is proposed to the Policy in respect of Non-executive Directors at the 2024 AGM. However, a number of changes to the implementation of the Policy for the Executive Directors have been implemented, to ensure remuneration remains closely aligned to Landsec's strategy and re/flects shareholder feedback received since the current Policy was approved at the 2021 AGM and these are explained on pages 78-79. We consulted with our top 15 shareholders and leading proxy advisers between November 2023 and January 2024 and the conclusions of the Policy review are included in this report. Overall, shareholders were supportive of our proposals.\n\n## PERFORMANCE FOR THE 2023/24 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nOverall, our results which are reported in more detail in this Annual Report, demonstrate Landsec's continued operational strength as values for the best assets begin to stabilise. For the full year, EPRA earnings remained stable at \u00a3371m with like-for-like earnings growth o/ffsetting the impact of material disposals in the prior year, and TRE improved to (4.0%) (2022/23: (8.3%)) with the outlook for return on equity turning more positive. Balance sheet strength has been preserved at 7.4x net debt/EBITDA and, pro-forma for disposals post year-end, a 32.3% Group LTV.\n\nThese results are considered by the Committee to be re/flected in the variable pay awarded to the Executive Directors described below.\n\n## ANNUAL BONUS\n\nAnnual bonus for 2023/24 was awarded at 47% of the maximum for the Chief Executive (CEO) and 49% of the maximum for the Chief Financial O/fficer (CFO).\n\nThis equates to around 70% of salary for the CEO and around 73% of salary for the CFO. As set out in detail in the Annual Report on Remuneration, both of the EPRA earnings targets were between target and maximum, TRE was below threshold and good progress was made against the ESG and personal targets.",

BASE SALARY\n\nFrom 1 June 2024, Executive Director salaries will increase by 3%. Pay rises across the wider workforce will generally be in the range of 3.25% and 3.75%.\n\n## 2. PENSION AND BENEFITS\n\nExecutive Director pension contributions will continue to be aligned to the wider workforce at 10.5% of salary. No changes will be made to bene/fit provision.\n\n## 3. ANNUAL BONUS\n\nFor the year ending 31 March 2025, Executive Directors will continue to be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 150% of salary. Alongside our Policy consultation we discussed changes to the measures and weightings in our annual bonus with shareholders and the feedback was generally positive. On this basis our 2024/25 bonus scheme is amended as follows (a) the weighting on /financial performance (previously 60% of potential) has been increased to 70% of bonus potential; (b) the 70% has been split equally between EPRA earnings and like-for-like Net Rental Income Growth (which replaces TRE); (c) the remaining 30% has been based on strategic targets which will always include ESG targets.

This is an important activity and I was pleased to answer a number of questions posed by the forum on remuneration quantum and structure (including the new Directors' Remuneration Policy) for the Executive Directors, the scope of the Committee and the benchmarks it uses, ESG in bonus and LTIP plans, TRE and retention and succession.\n\n## COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS\n\nAt the end of the year as part of the Board evaluation process which was run internally using questionnaires, the Committee reviewed its e/ffectiveness. The outcomes were positive, and there was good feedback on the Policy review process. The Committee also reviewed its adviser, FIT, and con/firmed it continued to be satis/fied with its performance.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nI am grateful for the engagement and support provided by our shareholders and welcome your feedback.\n\nUnless otherwise stated in this report, narrative and tables are unaudited.\n\nCHRISTOPHE EVAIN, CHAIR, REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperate as follows: (a) relative TSR targets measured against our FTSE 350 sector peers (weighting unchanged at 40%); (b) TRE (percentage change in EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share plus dividends) (weighting decreased slightly from 40% to 35%); (c) ESG measures at 25% including carbon reduction targets (15%) and newly introduced diversity and inclusion targets (10%). The rationale for these changes is explained on page 79).\n\nAny awards which vest will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.\n\n## REMUNERATION ADVICE\n\nThe Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary share plan matters from FIT. FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The Committee is satis/fied that their advice is independent and objective. Aside from some support on senior leader remuneration matters, FIT has no other connection with the Group. For the /financial year under review, FIT received fees of \u00a3126,028 for advisory services to the Committee (2022/23: \u00a375,676).\n\n## LAND SECURITIES OMNIBUS SHARE PLAN\n\nThe Company's existing Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 is due to expire next year, when it comes to the end of its ten-year life. As a result shareholders will be asked to approve a replacement arrangement, the Land Securities Group Omnibus Share Plan 2024, at the 2024 AGM. A summary of the terms of the Omnibus Plan is set out in the Notice of the 2024 AGM, which can be found on our website: landsec.com/agm.\n\n## REMUNERATION ACROSS THE COMPANY\n\nThe Committee oversees all remuneration policies and practices across the organisation, and is regularly briefed by the Chief People O/fficer. The Committee takes account of the interests of all internal and external stakeholders when making any decisions on remuneration matters. During the year ended 31 March 2024, we continued to grant LTIP awards to our senior leaders below the Executive Leadership Team, more closely aligning those who execute our strategy on a daily basis with the interests of our shareholders.",

Based on the average three-month share price to 31 March 2024 (649.6 pence).\n- 3. Based on the prevailing share price at the relevant grant date (695 pence).\n- 4. The difference between the value of the shares under awards vesting and the value of the shares at grant.\n- 5. Dividend equivalents accrue on 2021 LTIP awards during the vesting and during the holding period (or to the date of exercise if sooner). These will be included in the actual value of the LTIPs at the vesting date which will be presented in next year's Annual Report on Remuneration.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the estimated LTIP vesting values set out above and concluded that the vesting values do not represent unjusti/fied windfall gains, noting Landsec's strong operational performance over the three years to 31 March 2024, proactive execution of the strategy (which includes a number of material asset disposals) notwithstanding challenging market conditions, balance sheet strength (one of the strongest in the sector) and strong relative share price performance over the three years to 31 March 2024. Therefore no discretion was applied to amend the formulaic outcome.",

DIRECTORS' INTERESTS\n\n## 2.1 TOTAL SHAREHOLDING (AUDITED)\n\nDetails of the Directors' interests, including those of their immediate families and connected persons, in the issued share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year, together with con/firmation of whether the required shareholding has been met or whether a director is still building their holding, are set out in the table below.\n\nExecutive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within /five years of appointment to the Board. Where the minimum level is not met, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company. The current Policy requires Non-executive Directors to meet minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. As detailed in the Remuneration Policy Section, an amendment to the Non-executive Directors shareholding requirement in our Policy is being proposed at the 2024 AGM.\n\n| DIRECTORS' SHARES Name   | Salary/  base fee at  31 March 2024 (\u00a3)   | Minimum  shareholding  requirements  (% of salary/ base fee)4   | Required holding  value (\u00a3)   | Holding (ordinary shares) 1 April 2023   | Holding (ordinary shares) 31 March 2024   | Deferred bonus shares under holding  period   | Value of   holding  (\u00a3) 1   | TABLE 33 Met requirement  or building 2   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Mark Allan               | 856,960                                   | 300%                                                            | 2,570,880                     | 229,203                                  | 348,528                                   | 100,826                                       | 2,605,919                   | Met                                       |\n| Vanessa Simms            | 524,888                                   | 200%                                                            | 1,049,776                     | 51,400                                   | 108,150 5                                 | 53,143                                        | 876,242                     | Building                                  |\n| Edward Bonham Carter     | 81,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 70,000                        | 9,375                                    | 9,375                                     | -                                             | 61,706                      | Met4                                      |\n| Sir Ian Cheshire3        | 375,000                                   | 100%                                                            | 375,000                       | -                                        | 14,840                                    | -                                             | 97,677                      | Building                                  |\n| Madeleine Cosgrave       | 72,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 70,000                        | 10,535                                   | 10,535                                    | -                                             | 69,341                      | Met4                                      |\n| Christophe Evain         | 92,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 70,000                        | 8,000                                    | 8,000                                     | -                                             | 52,656                      | Met4                                      |\n| James Bowling3           | 92,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 92,100                        | -                                        | 4,557                                     | -                                             | 29,994                      | Building                                  |\n| Moni Mannings3           | 72,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 72,100                        | -                                        | -                                         | -                                             | -                           | Building                                  |\n| Miles Roberts            | 72,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 70,000                        | -                                        | 3,645                                     |                                               | 23,991                      | Building                                  |\n| Manjiry Tamhane          | 72,100                                    | 100%                                                            | 70,000                        | 4,473                                    | 4,473                                     | - -                                           | 29,441                      | Building                                  |\n\n- 1.

In line with the Committee's Terms of Reference, no individual was involved in the decisions relating to their own remuneration.\n\n|                                    | Current  Base fee (\u00a3k)   | New  Base fee 1 (\u00a3k)   | Percentage  increase   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Chair                              | 375                      | 386                    | 3%                     |\n| Non-executive Director             | 72                       | 74                     | 3%                     |\n| Additional fees                    |                          |                        |                        |\n| Audit/Remuneration Committee Chair | 20                       | 20                     | 0%                     |\n| Senior Independent Director        | 15                       | 15                     | 0%                     |\n\n## 3.3 PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE COMING YEAR\n\nPerformance metrics and weightings in respect of the annual bonus are set out below.\n\nFollowing the Policy review, the weighting on /financial performance (currently 60% of potential) was increased to 70% of bonus potential to ensure a greater focus on our key /financial performance metrics.\n\nThe 70% was split equally between EPRA Earnings (as currently operated for 30% of bonus potential) which remains a key performance indicator for Landsec; and LFL Net Rental Income Growth, which replaces the Total Return on Equity (previously referred to as Total Accounting Return) metric used for 30% of last year's bonus potential. This change re/flects both the importance of delivering like-for-like operational performance in the context of a higher for longer interest rate environment and shareholder feedback around the risk of double counting given that Total Return on Equity was used for both the 2023/24 annual bonus (30%) and the 2021 to 2023 long-term incentive awards (40%).\n\nThe remaining 30% is based on strategic targets rather than last year's approach whereby non-/financial targets were split equally between ESG (20% of potential) and personal objectives (20% of potential). This change simpli/fies target setting, assessment and communication. The number of strategic objectives will normally be limited to no more than seven objectives (albeit six will operate for 2024/25), with at least three relating to Landsec's ESG agenda (delivering on our environmental and D&I strategies) with the remaining objectives relating to other aspects of Landsec's balanced scorecard.",

The pay rise across the wider workforce was 6.75% (5% of which was accelerated and paid on 1 January 2023 to assist employees with the cost of living crisis), the remainder of which was paid on 1 June 2023. Pay rises across the wider workforce will generally be in the range of 3.25% and 3.75%.\n\nAs at 31 March 2024, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive Directors) was 11:1 (\u00a3856,960:\u00a380,479).",

Cressida Hogg left the Board on 16 May 2023. Nicholas Cadbury left the Board on 31 December 2023.\n- 5.

Re/flects the increase to base fees for Non-executive Directors awarded in 2023 for those serving in the full year 2022/23 and 2023/24.\n\n## D. CEO PAY RATIO\n\nThe tables below show how pay for the CEO compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles (calculated on a full-time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, which uses the total pay and bene/fits for all employees, and is the same methodology that is used to calculate the CEO's single /figure of remuneration table on page 72. Figures are calculated by reference to 31 March 2024 using actual pay data from April 2023 to March 2024. Excluded from our analysis are joiners, leavers and long-term absentees from the Company during the year. As the CEO has a larger proportion of his total remuneration linked to business performance than other employees in the UK workforce, the ratio has increased versus last year primarily as a result of the 2021 LTIP vesting at 60% of the maximum compared to the 2020 LTIP which vested at 38% of the maximum. This more than o/ffset the reduction in the bonus award (47% of maximum compared to 50% of maximum for the prior year). Given the alignment of incentive arrangements which are cascaded below Board level, the Remuneration Committee believes the pay ratios are consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Group's UK employees taken as a whole.\n\n| Year        | Method     | 25th percentile pay ratio   | Median pay ratio   | TABLE 47 75th percentile pay ratio   |\n|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 2023/24     | Option A   | 51:1                        | 32:1               | 21:1                                 |\n| 2022/23 1   | Option A   | 47:1                        | 29:1               | 18:1                                 |\n| 2021/22     | Option A   | 40:1                        | 25:1               | 16:1                                 |\n| 2020/21     | Option A   | 22:1                        | 14:1               | 10:1                                 |\n| 2019/20     | Option A   | 36:1                        | 23:1               | 15:1                                 |\n|             | CEO pay    | P25 pay                     | P50 pay            | P75 pay                              |\n| Salary      | \u00a3851,467   | \u00a342,832                     | \u00a367,235            | \u00a399,259                              |\n| Total pay 2 | \u00a32,901,303 | \u00a357,313                     | \u00a390,810            | \u00a3135,816                             |\n\n- 1.

DILUTION\n\nAwards granted under the Company's long-term incentive arrangements (LTIP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan, Restricted Share Plan and the ESOP) are satis/fied through the funding of an Employee Bene/fit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Bene/fit Trust held 3,119,107 ordinary shares at 31 March 2024 (2022/23: 3,831,399). The exercise of share options under the Land Securities Group PLC Sharesave, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one month's service with the Group, can be satis/fied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2024, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 538,608 shares (2022/23: 565,439), which represents less than 0.07% (2022/23: 0.08%) of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 7.

When setting the pay policy for Executive Directors, the Committee also considered pay practices and policies of the wider workforce in order to ensure the revised policy is proportionate and aligned with Landsec's culture. The review was approached with the following main aims:\n\n- \u00b7 remuneration should be clearly linked to the Group's purpose of creating Sustainable places, Connecting communities, Realising potential\n- \u00b7 remuneration should reward and drive the right behaviours and outcomes and re/flect strategic, personal and /financial achievements\n- \u00b7 remuneration should be designed in a manner that is clear for all stakeholders and re/flects their expectations\n- \u00b7 remuneration should be easy to explain and be viewed as fair\n- \u00b7 remuneration should be based on a pay-for-performance model\n\n## REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES\n\nOur remuneration principles, which we also aim to cascade throughout the business, underpin our Policy. These principles are that our remuneration should:\n\n- \u00b7 support the long-term success of the business and sustainable long-term shareholder value\n- \u00b7 materially di/fferentiate reward according to performance\n- \u00b7 be relevant, stretching and aligned to the business strategy and achievement of planned business goals\n- \u00b7 be compatible with Landsec's risk policies and systems, with malus and clawback provisions in place for all forms of variable pay\n- \u00b7 provide a balance between attracting, retaining and motivating talented people as well as supporting equal opportunity and diversity of talent\n- \u00b7 ensure that performance-related pay constitutes a proportion of the overall package appropriate to each level of the organisation\n- \u00b7 be clear and explainable to appropriate stakeholders, avoiding paying more than the Committee considers necessary\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS\n\nThe Committee values the views of Landsec's shareholders and guidance from the main shareholder representative bodies. As such, the Committee proactively consults with our major shareholders to ensure that their views are represented in discussions on remuneration matters. As part of the process for renewing the Policy, the Committee consulted with Landsec's top 15 shareholders as well as the major shareholder representative bodies on a set of draft proposals. Re/flecting the feedback received from major investors and representative bodies during the course of the engagement process, which was generally very positive, no changes were made to the original proposals.\n\n## PROPOSED POLICY CHANGES\n\nOn the basis that our strategy remains unchanged, no changes are proposed in respect of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors. We are however proposing one minor change to the Policy for Non-executive Directors.\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy states that Non-executive Directors are expected to meet a minimum shareholding guideline of 100% of their relevant annual fee within three years of appointment. However, going forward, while the purchase and retention of Landsec's shares by Non-executive Directors will continue to be expected, we are proposing to remove the 100% of fee within three years expectation as this is currently considered to be overly restrictive in respect of appointing new Non-executive Directors from more diverse backgrounds. As such, in this proposed Policy, Non-executive Directors will not be subject to a minimum shareholding expectation but will be required to have made a purchase of a number of Landsec shares within one year of appointment.",

bene/fits and 10.5% of salary pension contribution (/fixed pay)\n- \u00b7 Target remuneration comprises /fixed pay, 50% of the 2024/25 annual bonus and 50% vesting of the 2024 LTIP awards\n- \u00b7 Maximum remuneration comprises /fixed pay, 100% of the 2024/25 annual bonus and 100% vesting of the 2024 LTIP award based on a face value of 300% of salary\n- \u00b7 Maximum+ comprises maximum pay plus 50% share price appreciation on LTIP awards\n\n## 2. STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY\n\nThe proposed 2024 Policy is designed in line with the remuneration principles outlined on page 83 above. In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees in the Group. Landsec operates in a number of di/fferent environments and has many employees who carry out diverse roles across a number of locations. All employees, including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate and base salary levels are reviewed regularly. When considering salary increases for Executive Directors, the Company pays close attention to pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce. The Chief People O/fficer regularly updates the Committee on pay and conditions applying to the wider workforce. During 2023/24, the Committee\n\nreceived speci/fic updates on Gender Pay Reporting and pay ratios. The Committee does not formally consult with employees on the executive remuneration policy, although the Committee Chair met with the Employee Forum to discuss the proposed Policy changes. The Company also holds regular forums with employee groups and conducts regular employee engagement surveys, the results of which are presented to the Board. Remuneration arrangements for employees below Board level re/flect the seniority of the role.\n\n## 3. MALUS AND CLAWBACK PROVISIONS\n\nAll incentive scheme rules contain malus and/or clawback provisions that allow the Committee to reduce or retrieve a payment or an award.",

The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil.\n\n## CLAWBACK\n\nClawback is the recovery of payments made under the annual bonus plan or vested share awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. Clawback may apply to all or part of an Executive Director's payment/award and may be e/ffected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may apply malus/clawback when there are exceptional circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances include (without limitation):\n\n- \u00b7 a material mis-statement in the published results of the Group or one of its members\n- \u00b7 an error in assessing any applicable performance condition or the number of shares subject to an award\n- \u00b7 misconduct on the part of the Executive Director concerned\n- \u00b7 where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a material loss for the Group as a result of (i) reckless, negligent or wilful actions or omissions; or (ii) inappropriate behaviour\n\n- \u00b7 where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a corporate failure of the Group or one of its members\n- \u00b7 a Group member being censured by a regulatory body\n- \u00b7 events or behaviour on the part of the Executive Director leading to signi/ficant reputational damage to the Group\n- \u00b7 any other events that the Remuneration Committee considers speci/fically relevant to Landsec, e.g. a serious health and safety event or an exceptional negative event\n\n## 4.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES SHARE OWNERSHIP DURING EMPLOYMENT\n\nThe Executive Directors are expected to accumulate and maintain a holding in ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to no less than 300% of base salary for the CEO and 200% for other Executive Directors.\n\nExecutive Directors are normally expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within /five years of appointment to the Board. Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.\n\nAn annual calculation as a percentage of salary is made against the guidelines for each Executive Director as at 31 March each year based on the closing middle market quotation of the share price on the last business day in March.\n\n## SHARE OWNERSHIP POST CESSATION\n\nOn leaving the Board, Executive Directors are expected to maintain a shareholding equivalent to their in-employment shareholding requirement for a period of two years from the date of cessation. Shares acquired by the Executive are excluded from this calculation.\n\n## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to acquire shares within one year of appointment to the Board.\n\n## 7. TERMINATION PROVISIONS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\nThe Company's policy is for Executive Directors' Service Agreements to be terminable on 12 months' notice by either party. Service Agreements contain noncompete and non-solicit clauses with key suppliers and employees. In the event of early termination, any payment in lieu of notice would be limited to 12 months' basic salary, normally payable on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.\n\nIn addition to the scenarios below, an Executive Director's Service Agreement may be terminated without notice and without further payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.\n\nThe Committee retains discretion to determine the exact termination arrangements of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.\n\nThe table on page 90 sets out the general position and range of approaches in respect of incentive arrangements. In accordance with the terms of the relevant incentive plan rules, based on the circumstances of any departure, the Committee has discretion to determine how an Executive Director should be categorised for each element and determine payout/vesting levels accordingly based on the range as shown.\n\n## 6. DIRECTORS' SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT\n\nThe Executive Directors have Service Agreements with the Company which normally continue until the Director's agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. In line with Group policy, the Executive Directors' employment can be terminated at any time by either party on giving 12 months' prior written notice.\n\nThe Company allows Executive Directors to hold external non-executive directorships, subject to the prior approval of the Board, and to retain fees from these roles.\n\n## CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT\n\nThe Chairman and the Non-executive Directors do not have Service Agreements with the Company. Instead, each of them has a Letter of Appointment which sets out the terms of their appointment, including the three months' prior written notice on which their appointment can be terminated by either party at any time. The dates of the current Letters of Appointment are shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration and these, together with the Executive Directors' Service Agreements, are available for inspection at the Company's registered o/ffice.\n\nOn appointment, the fee arrangements for a new Non-executive Director are set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.\n\nFull details of the terms of appointment of each Director can be found on page 77 of the Remuneration Report.",

Executive Director for entering into a statutory settlement agreement and, additionally, may make a reasonable contribution towards fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. In the case of a corporate transaction, the Company may agree to pay reasonable legal fees (and any associated tax costs) on behalf of the Executive Director for advice on the e/ffect of the corporate transaction on the Executive Director's personal position as a director (including, where appropriate, as to the terms of their employment). The Company may agree to pay reasonable legal fees (and any associated tax costs) on behalf of the Executive Director for advice related to any proposed changes to their terms and conditions of employment during their period of employment.\n\n## 8. CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS\n\nOn a change of control, unvested LTIP awards will normally vest subject to performance and time pro-rating (although the Committee may allow a greater number of shares to vest than if pro-rating is applied where appropriate) and unvested deferred bonus shares vest in full. The contracts of the Executive Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company or for liquidated damages.\n\n## 9. REMUNERATION OF NEWLY APPOINTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\nThe remuneration package for a new externally appointed Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Company's approved Policy in force at the time of appointment.\n\n## FIXED PAY\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has the /flexibility to set the base salary of a new hire at the market level or at a discount to the market level initially, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years (subject to performance in the role) to bring the salary to the desired positioning\n- \u00b7 In exceptional circumstances the salary of a newly appointed Executive Director may exceed the market median benchmark for the role\n\n## VARIABLE PAY\n\n- \u00b7 The annual bonus will operate in accordance with the terms of the approved Policy, with the opportunity pro-rated for the period of employment in the /first year\n- \u00b7 Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment, it may be necessary to set revised performance measures and targets initially\n- \u00b7 The LTIP will also operate in accordance with the approved Policy",

This limit does not include the value of any buy-out arrangements (as described below) deemed appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the elements of the remuneration package covered by the policy, the Committee may 'buy out' certain existing remuneration arrangements of an incoming Executive Director through the o/ffer of either additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company. Any such payments will be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and will take into account the existing delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares, options), time horizons and performance conditions.\n\nIn the case of an internally appointed Executive Director, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be paid out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment will continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.\n\n## RELOCATION ALLOWANCE\n\nFor external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses, for a limited period only, as appropriate. Where a Director is recruited from overseas, /flexibility is retained to provide bene/fits that take account of market practice in their country of residence. The Company may o/ffer a cash amount on recruitment, payment of which may be staggered over a period of up to two years, to re/flect the value of bene/fits a new recruit may have received from a former employer.\n\n## LEGAL FEES\n\nOn recruitment of an Executive Director, the Company may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms and drawing up a service contract.\n\nShareholders will normally be informed of the remuneration package and all additional payments to newly-appointed Executive Directors at the time of their appointment.\n\n## 10. DISCRETIONS RETAINED BY THE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Committee operates the Group's various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC regulations where relevant. To ensure the e/fficient administration and appropriate governance of all remuneration arrangements the Committee may apply certain operational discretions, within the limits of the Directors' Remuneration Policy and relevant plan rules. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting the participants in the plans\n- \u00b7 determining the timing of awards and/or payments\n- \u00b7 determining the quantum of awards and/ or payments\n- \u00b7 selecting appropriate performance criteria and determining weightings, and adjusting these if necessary\n- \u00b7 setting performance targets for the various criteria, and adjusting these if necessary\n- \u00b7 adjusting the constituents of the comparator groups in respect of relative performance measures, if necessary\n- \u00b7 determining the extent of payment/vesting based on the assessment of performance\n- \u00b7 determining 'good leaver' status and the extent of payment/vesting in the case of the bonus and share-based plans\n- \u00b7 determining the treatment of awards under share-based plans in the event of a change of control\n- \u00b7 making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital, special dividends etc.)\n\nIn all cases, the Committee retains its absolute discretion to override formulaic outcomes in the bonus, LTIP and any other remuneration arrangements should the payouts not re/flect underlying Company performance.",

There are no special control rights attached to them save that the control rights of ordinary shares held in the EBT can be directed by the Company to satisfy the vesting of outstanding awards under its various employee share plans.\n\nIn relation to the EBT, the Trustee has agreed not to vote any shares held in the EBT at any general meeting. If any o/ffer is made to all shareholders to acquire their shares in Landsec, the Trustee will not be obliged to accept or reject the o/ffer in respect of any shares which are at the time subject to subsisting awards, but will have regard to the interests of the award holders and will have power to consult them to obtain their views on the o/ffer. Subject to the above, the Trustee may take such action with respect to an o/ffer as it thinks /fit.\n\nLandsec is not aware of any agreements or control rights between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The rights, including full details relating to voting of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer relating to Landsec's ordinary shares, are set out in the Articles and in the explanatory notes that accompany the Notice of the 2024 AGM. These documents are available on Landsec's website at: landsec.com/agm .\n\n## CHANGE OF CONTROL\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take e/ffect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover. None of these are considered signi/ficant. The Company's share plans contain provisions that take e/ffect in such an event but do not entitle participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than created by the initial grant or award under the relevant plan. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of o/ffice or employment or otherwise that occurs speci/fically because of a takeover.\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\nLandsec operates a Human Rights Policy which aims to recognise and safeguard the\n\nhuman rights of all citizens in the business areas under our control. We support the principles set out within both the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Policy is built on these foundations including, without limitation, the principles of equal opportunities, collective bargaining, freedom of association and protection from forced or child labour.\n\nThe Policy takes account of the Modern Slavery Act that came into force in October 2015 and requires Landsec to report annually on its workforce and supply chain, speci/fically to con/firm that workers are not enslaved or tra/fficked. Landsec's Modern Slavery Statement was last approved by the Board in July 2023 and is available on our website.\n\nLandsec is an equal opportunities employer and our range of employment policies and guidelines re/flects legal and employment requirements in the UK and safeguards the interests of employees, potential employees and other workers. We do not condone unfair treatment of any kind and o/ffer equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and advancement regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, religious or political beliefs.\n\nLandsec recognises that it has clear obligations towards all its employees and the community at large to ensure that disabled people are a/fforded equal opportunities to enter employment and progress. Landsec has therefore established procedures designed to provide fair consideration and selection of disabled applicants and to satisfy their training and career development needs. If an employee becomes disabled, wherever possible Landsec takes steps to provide reasonable adjustments to their existing employment arrangements, or by redeployment and providing appropriate retraining to enable continued employment in the Group. Further information can be found on pages 25-27.\n\n## POLITICAL DONATIONS\n\nThe Company did not make any political donations or expenditure in the year that require disclosure (2023: nil).\n\n## AUDITOR AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR\n\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information that has not been brought to the attention of the Company's auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that such information was provided to the auditor.\n\nA resolution to con/firm the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as auditor of the Company will be proposed at the 2024 AGM. The reappointment has been recommended to the Board by the Audit Committee and EY has indicated its willingness to remain in o/ffice.\n\n## 2024 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThis year's AGM is scheduled to be held at 2.30 pm on Thursday, 11 July 2024 at 80 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL.\n\nA separate circular, comprising a letter from the Chair, Notice of Meeting and explanatory notes in respect of the resolutions proposed, can be found on our website: landsec.com/agm .\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nThe purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information to the members of the Company and it has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company as a body, and no other persons. The Company, its Directors and employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this document is shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed.\n\nA cautionary statement in respect of forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report appears on the inside back cover of this document.\n\nThe Directors' Report was approved by the Board on 16 May 2024.\n\nBy Order of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMARINA THOMAS, COMPANY SECRETARY\n\nLand Securities Group PLC Company number 4369054",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the /financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe Non-Audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN\n\nIn auditing the /financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the /financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the risk around going concern in planning our audit, at the interim and again at the year-end phase.\n- \u00b7 con/firming our understanding of the Group's going concern assessment process and reviewing management's related Board papers.\n- \u00b7 assessing and challenging the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern review period to the end of September 2025 and considering whether there are any known events or conditions that will occur in the short-term following the going concern period which would impact our considerations.\n- \u00b7 challenging the key assumptions and inputs used by management within the base case and downside scenarios modelled by management by comparing to corroborative evidence and searching out independent contradictory evidence.\n- \u00b7 challenging whether sustainability costs identi/fied by management associated with the Net Zero Transition Investment Plan have been appropriately considered within the base case and downside scenarios modelled by management.\n- \u00b7 assessing and challenging management's consideration of downside sensitivities taking into account current events and market conditions. We have applied further sensitivities on income, in/flation and interest assumptions where appropriate to stress test the impact on both liquidity and covenants. As part of our sensitivity testing, we considered the perspective of our chartered surveyors on forecast valuation movements.",

This has included re-performing calculations and testing the formulas being applied throughout.\n- \u00b7 checking that the terms and conditions of the debt agreements with lenders had been appropriately incorporated into the going concern scenarios and modelling, including the maturity pro/file of the Group's borrowings, the impact of the Security Group structure (as de/fined in the Glossary on page 188) and the tiered operating covenant regime.\n- \u00b7 performing testing to evaluate whether the covenant requirements of the debt facilities would be breached under either the base case or the downside scenarios through the going concern period.\n- \u00b7 challenging the conclusions that both the levels of decline required to breach the covenants and the reverse stress test prepared can be considered as remote by obtaining external market outlooks in relation to future valuations and reviewing previous declines observed in results.\n- \u00b7 testing on key assumptions and considered the likelihood of outcomes including controllable mitigating actions, which include uncommitted capital expenditure, acquisitions, disposals and developments, over and above the scenarios modelled.\n- \u00b7 further challenging the cash /flow forecasts with reference to historical trends and assessing the outcome of management's previous forecasts.\n- \u00b7 reviewing the disclosures in the /financial statements relating to going concern with a view to con/firming that they appropriately disclose the risk, the impact on the Group's operations and results and potential mitigating actions.\n\nThe results of the severe but plausible downside scenarios modelled by management indicate that the Group would maintain available facility and covenant headroom to be able to withstand the impact of plausible downside sensitivities throughout the period of the going concern assessment to 30 September 2025.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/fied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 30 September 2025.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nAudit scope\n\nKey audit matters\n\nMateriality\n\n- \u00b7 The Group operates in the United Kingdom through four segments: Central London, Major retail, Mixed-use urban and Subscale sectors. \u00b7 We have identi/fied the Group as one component and perform full scope procedures across the entire Group. The Group audit team also performed audit procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group /financial statements.\n- \u00b7 The valuation of property, including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures.\n- \u00b7 Revenue recognition, including service charge income and the treatment of lease incentives.\n- \u00b7 Overall Group materiality of \u00a396m which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2024. Overall materiality is applied to account balances related to investment properties and trading properties (either wholly owned or within the Joint Venture) and loans and borrowings (excluding the related /finance expense).\n- \u00b7 Speci/fic materiality of \u00a319m, which represents 5% of EPRA Earnings before tax. Speci/fic materiality is applied to account balances which are not account balances related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or within the Joint Venture) and loans and borrowings.\n- \u00b7 Parent Company materiality of \u00a351m, which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Parent Company balance sheet. Parent Company materiality is applied to all balances within the Parent Company.",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We take into account size, risk pro/file, the organisation of the Group and e/ffectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact of climate change and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Land Securities Group PLC. The Group has determined that the most signi/ficant future impacts from climate change on their operations will be from failure to meet their 2040 science-based net zero target leading to regulatory, reputational and commercial impact and failure to mitigate physical impact on the Group's assets. These are explained in the required Task Force On Climate Related Financial Disclosures and on pages 41 to 45 in the principal risks and uncertainties. They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 28-32. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited /financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its /financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in the basis of preparation note within the /financial statements how they have re/flected the impact of climate change in their /financial statements including how this aligns with their commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2040. The impact of climate change on signi/ficant judgements and estimates are included in note 2.\n\nOur audit e/ffort in considering the impact of climate change on the /financial statements was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the e/ffects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 41 to 45 and the signi/ficant judgements and estimates disclosed in note 2 and whether these have been appropriately re/flected in the valuation of the investment properties, investment properties held in joint ventures and trading properties or have any other material impact on the /financial statements. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the /financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work, whilst we have not identi/fied the impact of climate change on the /financial statements to be a standalone key audit matter, we have considered the impact on the valuation of property, including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures key audit matter. Details of the impact, our procedures and /findings are included in our explanation of key audit matter below.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period and include the most signi/ficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identi/fied. These matters included those which had the greatest e/ffect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the e/fforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

We determined that an asset-based measure would be the most appropriate basis for determining overall materiality given that key users of the Group's /financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the Group's assets. Based on this, we determined that it is appropriate to set the overall materiality at 0.9% of total assets (2023: 0.9% of total assets). We applied overall materiality to the investment properties and trading properties balances (either wholly owned or within the Joint Venture) and loans and borrowings (excluding the related /finance expense) as the value of loans and borrowings which are secured against the Group's investment properties.\n\nThis provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.\n\nWe determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) or loans and borrowings, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the /financial statements as a whole could in/fluence the economic decisions of users. We believe that it is most appropriate to use a pro/fit-based measure as pro/fit is also a focus of users of the /financial statements.\n\nWe determined that materiality for these areas should be based upon 5% of EPRA earnings before tax. EPRA earnings is considered an important performance metric and aligned with industry earnings measures.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality which resulted in a reduction to our overall materiality as a result of total assets having decreased from our initial materiality assessment.\n\n## PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2023: 75%) of our planning materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.\n\n## REPORTING THRESHOLD\n\nAn amount below which identi/fied misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit di/fferences in excess of \u00a35m (2023: \u00a35m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as di/fferences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, including the Strategic Report and Governance section set out on pages 1-94, other than the /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the /financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the /financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.",

or\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to /financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the FCA Rules\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us;

or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speci/fied for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' Statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identi/fied set out on pages 46-47 and 95;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 46-47;\n- \u00b7 Director's Statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 95;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 95;\n- \u00b7 Board's con/firmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on pages 41-45;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of e/ffectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 38-45; and;\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on pages 62-69.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS\n\nAs explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 95, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the /financial statements and for being satis/fied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\n## EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most signi/ficant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), Listing Rules, the relevant tax regulations in the United Kingdom, including the UK REIT regulations, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health & Safety Regulations, Building Safety Act and the Bribery Act. There are no signi/ficant industry speci/fic laws or regulations that we considered in determining our approach.\n- \u00b7 We understood how Land Securities Group PLC is complying with those frameworks through enquiry with management, and by identifying the Group's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We also identi/fied those members of management who have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for reporting any known instances of non-compliance to those charged with governance. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the board and the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up. Our assessment included the tone from the top and the emphasis on a culture of honest and ethical behaviour.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's /financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by reviewing the Company's risk register and enquiry with management and the Audit Committee during the planning and execution phases of our audit. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identi/fied, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how management monitors those programmes and controls.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved:\n- - Enquiry of management, and when appropriate, those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any non-compliance or potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that could a/ffect the /financial statements;\n- - Understanding of management's internal controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;\n- - Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing and extent of our testing;\n- - Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;\n- - Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, including those of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee;\n- - Reading of internal audit reports;\n- - Obtaining electronic con/firmations from the Group's banking providers to vouch the existence of cash balances and completeness of loans, borrowings and other treasury positions such as derivatives;\n- - Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies, including the FRC and HMRC;\n- - Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their signi/ficant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the valuation of investment property and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of Land Securities Group PLC (see key audit matters set out earlier in this report); and\n- - Journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding the business.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

A description of accounting policies speci/fic to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the /financial statements.\n\nThis section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have been applied in the year and those not yet adopted, and their actual or expected impact on the reported results of the Group.\n\n## 1 \u203a BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThese /financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs and IFRICs), and as regards the Parent Company /financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The /financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost convention as modi/fied by the revaluation of investment property, /financial assets at fair value through pro/fit or loss, derivative /financial instruments and pension assets. As applied by the Group and the Company, there are no material di/fferences between UK adopted international accounting standards and EU IFRS.\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the /financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may di/ffer from those estimates.\n\nLand Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income statement), as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The Merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable pro/fit. Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, the Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by the Group.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nThe impact of international and domestic political and economic events over the course of the year has resulted in the UK facing a prolonged period of high in/flation, rising interest rates and minimal GDP growth. Therefore, the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group's going concern assessment considers changes in the Group's principal risks (see pages 41-45) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our /financial performance and continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group's secured debt structure within its /financial covenants, which are described in note 22.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed base case, downside and reverse stress test models, as well as a cash /flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic assumptions on the Group's operating environment (the 'mitigated downside scenario'). This mitigated downside scenario re/flects unfavourable macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in our ability to collect rent and service charge from our customers and removes uncommitted capital expenditure, acquisitions, disposals and developments.\n\nThe Group's key metrics from the mitigated downside scenario as at the end of the going concern assessment period, which covers the 16 months to 30 September 2025, are shown below alongside the actual position at 31 March 2024.\n\n| Key metrics                   | 31 March 2024   | Mitigated downside  scenario 30 September 2025   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV            | 37.0%           | 42.8%                                            |\n| Adjusted net debt             | \u00a33,517m         | \u00a33,885m                                          |\n| EPRA net tangible assets      | \u00a36,398m         | \u00a35,559m                                          |\n| Available /financial headroom | \u00a31.9bn          | \u00a30.9bn                                           |",

Under this scenario, the Security Group's asset values would need to fall by a further 34% from the sensitised values forecasted at 30 September 2025 to be non-compliant with the LTV covenant. This equates to a 43% fall in the value of the Security Group's assets from the 31 March 2024 values for the LTV to reach 65%. The Directors consider the likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote.\n\nThe Security Group also requires earnings before interest of at least \u00a3198m in the full year ending 31 March 2025 and at least \u00a3232m in the full year ending 31 March 2026 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the mitigated downside scenario, which would ensure compliance with the Group's covenant through to the end of the going concern assessment period. Security Group earnings post year end 31 March 2024 are above the level required to meet the interest cover covenant for the year ended 31 March 2025. The Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security Group earnings over the period ending 30 September 2025 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant.\n\nThe Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received, to determine when our available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, although breaching the interest cover covenant, the Group continues to have su/fficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the /financial statements of the Group and parent for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the e/ffective date of acquisition or to the e/ffective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which di/ffer from Group accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation.\n\nWhere instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classi/fied as a /financial liability, called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and movements are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere equity in a subsidiary is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the shareholders of the parent, this is classi/fied as a non-controlling interest. Total comprehensive income or loss and the total equity of the Group are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests according to their respective ownership percentages.\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for by including the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.\n\nIntra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated /financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",

The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most signi/ficant involve assumptions or key estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may di/ffer from these estimates. These key estimates are deemed to have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year. Other sources of estimation uncertainties identi/fied below are estimates deemed to have a lower risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year.\n\n## JUDGEMENTS\n\n- \u00b7 Recognising revenue where property management activities are performed by a third party (note 6)\n- \u00b7 Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (note 12)\n- \u00b7 Accounting for certain property acquisitions and disposals (note 14)\n\n## KEY ESTIMATES\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation of investment properties (note 14)\n\n## OTHER SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation of trading properties (note 15)\n- \u00b7 Impairment of trade receivables (note 27)\n- \u00b7 Estimation of provisions (note 34)\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, taking into account the relevant disclosures in the Strategic Report, including those made in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. These considerations included the limited exposure in terms of our investment properties, as we fully costed and committed to invest \u00a3135m to achieve our science-based target by 2030 (note this cost will /fluctuate year on year as we account for changes in in/flation and portfolio composition). Related capital expenditure and the expected impact on ERVs associated with this commitment have been factored within property valuations. On this basis, the Group has concluded that climate change did not have a material impact on the /financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that this is not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's going concern or viability assessment.\n\n## 3 \u203a CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS\n\nThe accounting policies used in these /financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual /financial statements, as amended where relevant to re/flect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became e/ffective in the year as listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of accounting policies\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 - De/finition of Accounting Estimates\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 12 - International tax reform - Pillar Two model rules\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nThere has been no material impact on the /financial statements of adopting any new standards, amendments and interpretations.",

Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these di/fferent forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.0bn , is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. The Combined Portfolio comprises the investment properties of the Group's subsidiaries, on a proportionately consolidated basis when not wholly owned, together with our share of investment properties held in our joint ventures (see note 14). We consider this presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group's statutory /financial statements, where the Group's interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all /financial measures.\n\nEPRA earnings is an alternative performance measure and is the Group's alternative measure of the underlying pre-tax pro/fit of the property rental business. EPRA earnings excludes all items of a capital nature, such as valuation movements and pro/fits and losses on the disposal of investment properties, as well as exceptional items. The Group believes that EPRA earnings provides additional understanding of the Group's operational performance to shareholders and other stakeholder groups. A full de/finition of EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. The components of EPRA earnings are presented on a proportionate basis in note 4.\n\nOur income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including interest expense), which we refer to as EPRA earnings, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of properties, re/financing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital and other items. Our income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to EPRA earnings and Capital and other items. The total column represents the Group's results presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional information. We believe EPRA earnings provides further understanding of the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.",

Major retail destinations includes all regional shopping centres and shops outside London and our outlets. The Mixed-use urban segment includes those assets where we see the most potential for capital investment. Subscale sectors mainly includes assets that will not be a focus for capital investment and consists of leisure and hotel assets and retail parks.\n\nManagement has determined the Group's operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker is the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors and the Managing Directors. The information presented to ELT includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, /financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.\n\nThe Group's primary measure of underlying pro/fit before tax is EPRA earnings. However, Segment net rental income is the lowest level to which the pro/fit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the four segments. The administrative costs, which are predominantly sta/ff costs for centralised functions, are all treated as administrative expenses and are not allocated to individual segments.\n\nThe Group manages its /financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries, on a pooled basis. Individual joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries may have speci/fic /financing arrangements in place. Debt facilities and /finance expenses, including those of joint ventures, are managed centrally and are therefore not attributed to a particular segment. Unallocated income and expenses are items incurred centrally which are not directly attributable to one of the segments.\n\nAll items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis.\n\n## SEGMENTAL RESULTS\n\n| EPRA EARNINGS                                             | 2024 2023          | 2024 2023         | 2024 2023           | 2024 2023            | 2024 2023   | 2024 2023          | 2024 2023         | 2024 2023           | 2024 2023            | 2        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|\n|                                                           | Central  London \u00a3m | Major   retail \u00a3m | Mixed-use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m    | Central  London \u00a3m | Major   retail \u00a3m | Mixed-use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Rental income                                             | 294                | 188               | 58                  | 112                  | 652         | 313                | 179               | 58                  | 107                  | 657      |\n| Finance lease interest                                    | -

The non-wholly owned subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% in the Group's income statement, but only the Group's share is included in EPRA earnings reported in the segmental results table. The non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries are included in the 'Capital and other items' column presented in the Group's income statement, together with items not directly related to the underlying rental business such as investment properties valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of investment properties, the proceeds from, and costs of, the sale of trading properties, income from and costs associated with development contracts, amortisation and impairment of intangibles, and other attributable costs, arising on business combinations.\n- 3. Included in the loss on disposal of investment properties is a \u00a32m charge (2023: \u00a39m charge) related to the provision for /fire safety remediation works on properties no longer owned by the Group but for which the Group is responsible for remediating under the Building Safety Act 2022.",

Three of the Group's key /financial performance measures are EPRA earnings per share, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share and Total return on equity. Refer to table 57 in the Business Analysis section for further details on these alternative performance measures.\n\nEPRA earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of underlying earnings, is the basis for the calculation of EPRA earnings per share. We believe EPRA earnings and EPRA earnings per share provide further insight into the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as they focus on the rental income performance of the business and exclude Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.\n\n| EARNINGS PER SHARE                                          | Loss for  the year \u00a3m   | Year ended  31 March 2024 EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Loss for   the year \u00a3m   | Year ended  31 March 2023 EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Loss attributable to shareholders of the parent             | (319)                   | (319)                                         | (619)                    | (619)                                         |\n| Valuation and loss on disposals                             | -                       | 650                                           | -                        | 1,016                                         |\n| Net /finance expense/(income) (excluded from EPRA earnings) | -                       | 20                                            | -                        | (21)                                          |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                      | -                       | 1                                             | -                        | 5                                             |\n| Other                                                       | -                       | 19                                            | -                        | 12                                            |\n| (Loss)/pro/fit used in per share calculation                | (319)                   | 371                                           | (619)                    | 393                                           |\n|                                                             | IFRS                    | EPRA                                          | IFRS                     | EPRA 2                                        |\n| Basic (loss)/earnings per share                             | (43.0)p                 | 50.1p                                         | (83.6)p                  | 53.1p                                         |\n| Diluted (loss)/earnings per share 1                         | (43.0)p                 | 50.1p                                         | (83.6)p                  | 53.1p                                         |\n\n- 1.

Lease incentives being o/ffered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to /fit out or similar costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis. Where the total consideration due under a lease is modi/fied, for example, where a concession is granted to a tenant prior to the date the conceded rent falls due, the revised total amount due under the lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\n\nContingent rents, being lease payments that are not /fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents as well as surrender premiums net of dilapidations, are considered as variable consideration and are recorded as income in the year in which they are earned. Where a single payment is received from a tenant to cover both rent and service charge, the service charge component is separated and reported as service charge income.\n\nThe Group's revenue from contracts with customers, as de/fined in IFRS 15, includes service charge income, other property related income, trading property sales proceeds and development contract income.\n\nService charge income and management fees are recorded as income over time in the year in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised over time because the tenants bene/fit from the services as soon as they are rendered by the Group. The actual service provided during each reporting period is determined using cost incurred as the input method.\n\nOther property related income includes development and asset management fees. These fees are recognised over time, using time elapsed as the input method which measures the bene/fit simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, over the period the development or asset management services are provided.\n\nProceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when control of the property transfers to the buyer, i.e. the buyer has the ability to direct the use of the property and the right to the cash in/flows and out/flows generated by it. This generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion. If completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange or if the Group has signi/ficant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion, the Group assesses whether there are multiple performance obligations in the contract and recognises revenue as each performance obligation is satis/fied.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWhen property is let under a /finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease. Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and /finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the /finance lease and is recognised within revenue.\n\nRevenue on development contracts is recognised over time over the period of the contract as the Group creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls. Progress towards completion of the development, by reference to the value of work completed using the costs incurred to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract is used as the input method.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor those properties where the property management activities are performed by a third party, the Group considers the third party to be the principal delivering the service. The key factors considered by the Group when making this judgement include the following responsibilities of the third party:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting suppliers and ensuring all services are delivered\n- \u00b7 establishing prices and seeking e/fficiencies\n- \u00b7 risk management and compliance\n\nIn addition, the residual rights residing with the Group are generally protective in nature.\n\nAll revenue is classi/fied within the 'EPRA earnings' column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds from the sale of trading properties, income from development contracts or transactions and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                           | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   |   2024 Total \u00a3m | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Rental income (excluding adjustment for lease incentives) | 598                 | 8                              |             606 | 606                 | 8                              | 614             |\n| Adjustment for lease incentives                           | 16                  | -

If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash /flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nRents payable re/flect amounts due under head leases. Where rents payable are variable, and do not depend on an index or rate, the payments are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Where these rents are /fixed, or in-substance /fixed, at the inception of the agreement, or become /fixed or in-substance /fixed at some point over the life of the agreement, an asset representing the right to use the underlying land and a corresponding liability for the present value of the minimum future lease payments are recognised on the Group's balance sheet within Investment properties and borrowings respectively.\n\nAll costs are classi/fied within the 'EPRA earnings' column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties, costs arising on development contracts or transactions, amortisation and impairments of intangible assets, and other attributable costs, arising on business combinations and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                  | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   | 2024 Total \u00a3m   | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Rents payable                                    | 11                  | -                              | 11              | 10                  | -                              | 10              |\n| Service charge expense                           | 130                 | 3                              | 133             | 98                  | 2                              | 100             |\n| Direct property expenditure                      | 113                 | 1                              | 114             | 98                  | 2                              | 100             |\n| Movement in bad and doubtful debts provision     | (6)                 | -                              | (6)             | (2)                 | -                              | (2)             |\n| Administrative expenses                          | 73                  | -                              | 73              | 80                  | -                              | 80              |\n| Impairment of trading properties                 | -                   | 11                             | 11              | -                   | 19                             | 19              |\n| Cost of trading property disposals               | -                   | 26                             | 26              | -                   | 21                             | 21              |\n| Development contract and transaction expenditure | -                   | 40                             | 40              | -                   | 41                             | 41              |\n| Depreciation, including amortisation of software | 4                   | 2                              | 6               | 5                   | 3                              | 8               |\n| Impairment of amounts due from joint ventures    | -                   | 2                              | 2               | -                   | -                              | -               |\n| Impairment of goodwill                           | -                   | 1                              | 1               | -                   | 5                              | 5               |\n| Fair value gain on remeasurement of investment   | -                   | (3)                            | (3)             | -                   | -                              | -               |\n| Other costs                                      | -                   | 1                              | 1               | -                   | -                              | -               |\n| Total costs per the income statement             | 325                 | 84                             | 409             | 289                 | 93                             | 382             |",

Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled.\n\nNo provision is made for temporary di/fferences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its pro/fits and gains from the qualifying rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying pro/fits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group's assets;\n- \u00b7 at least 75% of the Group's total pro/fits must arise from the tax exempt business; and\n- \u00b7 at least 90% of the notional taxable pro/fit of the property rental business must be distributed.\n\nThe Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary di/fferences relating to the property rental business.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believes it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the deductible temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nThere is no income tax charge in the income statement (2023: none). There is a deferred tax credit of \u00a34m (2023: \u00a33m credit) included within other comprehensive income.",

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group's IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest are presented as either 'Investment properties' or 'Trading properties'. The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Group's share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within 'Investments in joint ventures'.\n\nInternally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.0bn , is an example of this proportionate share, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further insight to stakeholders about the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Both of these values are determined by the Group's external valuers. The combined value of the Group's total investment property portfolio (including the Group's share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nInvestment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. The di/fference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or de/ficit. Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.\n\nSome of the Group's investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of the lease and accounted for as investment property. Initially, the cost of investment properties held under leases includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The investment properties held under leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. A corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the liability and a /finance charge to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding liability.\n\n## TRADING PROPERTIES\n\nTrading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are presented on the balance sheet within current assets.\n\n## ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes control of the property.\n\n## CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND CAPITALISATION OF BORROWING COSTS\n\nCapital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised. Where borrowings are speci/fically used to /finance any capital expenditure on the properties, the actual borrowing costs incurred are capitalised. However, where borrowings are used generally to /finance the operations of the Group, the interest capitalised is calculated using the Group's weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal sta/ff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised. The total sta/ff and associated costs are capitalised based on the proportion of time spent on the relevant scheme. Internal sta/ff costs are capitalised from the date the Group determines it is probable that the development will progress until the date of practical completion.",

When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is remeasured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement. The remeasured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.\n\n## DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperties are treated as disposed when control of the property is transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on unconditional exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have signi/ficant outstanding obligations after exchange, the control will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion.\n\nThe pro/fit on disposal is determined as the di/fference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The pro/fit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.\n\n## S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperty transactions can be complex in nature and material to the /financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be recognised, management consider whether the Group assumes or relinquishes control of the property, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished. Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must be satis/fied before the contract is ful/filled. In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND OTHER SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY VALUATION OF THE GROUP'S PROPERTIES\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio has been undertaken by independent valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation - Global Standards and UK Supplement (together the 'Red Book'). Real estate by its nature is a complex asset class with value determined by a range of factors overlaid by interpretation and judgemental assessment of market data; as such it is classi/fied as a 'Level 3 asset' within IFRS. Factors a/ffecting valuation are on an individual property level and include the property type, location, tenure and tenancy characteristics, quality of the asset and prospects for future rental revenue.\n\nThe Group's investment property valuation has been undertaken by valuers interpreting market evidence as available in reaching their conclusions on Fair Value, re/flecting asset speci/fic data provided by Management, making assumptions that tenure, tenancies, town planning and condition of buildings are as provided. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction volume in the property market.\n\nThe estimation of the net realisable value of the Group's trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to signi/ficant market variation over the course of development. As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group's trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIf the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of the Group's investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an e/ffect on the Group's /financial position and results.",

Refer to note 16 for a breakdown of this amount by entity.\n\nThe net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is \u00a31,604m (2023: \u00a31,723m).\n\nInvestment properties include capitalised interest of \u00a3290m (2023: \u00a3271m). The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 4.8% (2023: 3.0%). The gross historical cost of investment properties is \u00a38,502m (2023: \u00a38,280m).\n\n## VALUATION PROCESS\n\nThe fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2024 was determined by the Group's external valuers, CBRE and JLL. The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations performed by the valuers are reviewed internally by Senior Management and other relevant people within the business. This process includes discussions of the assumptions used by the valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuers on a half-yearly basis.\n\nThe valuers' opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm's length terms and using appropriate valuation techniques. The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. Under this approach, forecast net cash /flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers' opinion of fair value. The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash /flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.",

Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including /finance and developer's pro/fit, to arrive at the valuation. Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development (excluding /finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants. As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.\n\nThe Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within 'Level 3', as de/fined by IFRS 13 and as explained in Note 26(III). Accordingly, there have been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the /financial year.\n\nThe table below summarises the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the Group's wholly owned investment properties, and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest, at 31 March 2024:\n\n|                                              | Market  value   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Equivalent yield %   | Equivalent yield %   | Equivalent yield %   |     |           | Costs \u00a3 per sq ft   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|\n|                                              | \u00a3m              | Low                                  | Average                              | High                                 | Low                  | Average              | High                 | Low | Average 1 | High                |\n| Central London                               |                 |                                      |                                      |                                      |                      |                      |                      |     |           |                     |\n| West End o/ffices                            | 2,754           | 20                                   | 85                                   | 132                                  | 4.3%                 | 5.3%                 | 5.8%                 | -

Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group's share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the /financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nThe Group's principal joint arrangements are described below:\n\n| Joint ventures 1                             | Percentage owned  & voting rights 2   | Business segment                 | Year end date 3   | Joint venture partner                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Held at 31 March 2024                        |                                       |                                  |                   |                                                                                     |\n| Nova, Victoria 4                             | 50%                                   | Central London                   | 31 March          | Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust                                                 |\n| Southside Limited Partnership                | 50%                                   | Major retail                     | 31 March          | Invesco Real Estate European Fund                                                   |\n| Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership | 50%                                   | Major retail,   Subscale sectors | 31 March          | The Crown Estate Commissioners                                                      |\n| Harvest 5                                    | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                 | 31 March          | J Sainsbury plc                                                                     |\n| The Ebbs/fleet Limited Partnership 7         | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                 | 31 March          | Ebbs/fleet Property Limited                                                         |\n| West India Quay Unit Trust 7                 | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                 | 31 March          | Schroder UK Real Estate Fund                                                        |\n| May/field 6,7                                | 50%                                   | Mixed-use urban                  | 31 March          | LCR Limited, Manchester City Council,  Transport for Greater Manchester             |\n| Curzon Park Limited 7                        | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                 | 31 March          | Derwent Developments (Curzon)  Limited                                              |\n| Plus X Holdings Limited 7                    | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                 | 31 March          | Paul David Rostas, Matthew Edmund  Hunter                                           |\n| Landmark Court Partnership Limited 7         | 51%                                   | Central London                   | 31 March          | TTL Landmark Court Properties Limited                                               |\n| Opportunities for Sittingbourne Limited 7    | 50%                                   | Mixed-use urban                  | 31 March          | Swale Borough Council                                                               |\n| Cathedral (Movement, Greenwich) LLP 7        | 52%                                   | Mixed-use urban                  | 31 March          | Mr Richard Upton                                                                    |\n| Circus Street Developments Limited 7         | 50%                                   | Mixed-use urban                  | 31 March          | High Wire Brighton Limited                                                          |\n| Joint operation                              | Ownership interest                    | Business segment                 | Year end date 3   | Joint operation partners                                                            |\n| Held at 31 March 2024                        |                                       |                                  |                   |                                                                                     |\n| Bluewater, Kent                              | 48.75%                                | Major retail                     | 31 March          | M&G Real Estate and GIC Royal London Asset Management Aberdeen Standard Investments |\n\n- 1.

At the outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is de-recognised from investment property and recognised as a /finance lease receivable. The /finance lease receivable is derecognised in the event that the lease is terminated. Lease income is recognised over the period of the lease, re/flecting a constant rate of return.

The fair value at the date of acquisition was \u00a330m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years. On recognition of the other intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of \u00a36m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount. The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the other intangible asset is amortised or impaired, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is tested for impairment.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2024, the other intangible asset has been impaired by \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil). The recoverable amount of the other intangible asset has been based on its fair value less costs of disposal applying discounted cash /flow projections, using a discount rate of 8.0% with cash /flows projected over a period of 10 years and a growth rate applied of 3.1% .

The total capital of the Group consists of shareholders' equity and net debt. The Group's strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing /financial and operating market cycles. The table in note 21 details a number of the Group's key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.\n\nA key element of the Group's capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets (the Security Group). This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term /flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates. In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable /flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate /finance for each speci/fic asset or joint venture.\n\n## 21 \u203a CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n|                                                    | Group \u00a3m   | Joint  ventures \u00a3m   | Adjustment  for non-  wholly owned  subsidiaries \u00a3m   | 2024 Combined \u00a3m   | Group \u00a3m   | Joint  ventures \u00a3m   | Adjustment   for non-  wholly owned  subsidiaries \u00a3m   | 2023 Combined \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Property portfolio                                 |            |                      |                                                       |                    |            |                      |                                                        |                    |\n| Market value of investment properties              | 9,465      | 616                  | (118)                                                 | 9,963              | 9,743      | 635                  | (139)                                                  | 10,239             |\n| Trading properties and long-term contracts         | 100        | -

Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nWhen debt re/financing exercises are carried out, existing liabilities will be treated as being extinguished when the new liability is substantially di/fferent from the existing liability. In making this assessment, the Group will consider the transaction as a whole, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative characteristics.\n\n|                                                                                                               | Secured/  unsecured     | Fixed/  /floating      | E/ffective   interest rate %   | Nominal/  notional  value  \u00a3m   | Fair   value \u00a3m   | 2024 Book  value \u00a3m   | Nominal/  notional  value  \u00a3m   | Fair   value \u00a3m   | 2023 Book  value \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Current borrowings                                                                                            |                         |                        |                                |                                 |                   |                       |                                 |                   |                       |\n| Commercial paper                                                                                              |                         |                        |                                |                                 |                   |                       |                                 |                   |                       |\n| Sterling                                                                                                      | Unsecured Floating      |                        | Various 1                      | 15                              | 15                | 15                    | -

The Security Group includes wholly owned investment properties, development properties and a number of the Group's investments in other assets, in total valued at \u00a39.2bn at 31 March 2024 (31 March 2023: \u00a39.6bn). The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial /flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45x respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate of each MTN is /fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date of the MTN. The interest rate for the last two years may either become /floating on a SONIA basis plus an increased margin (relative to that at the time of issue), or subject to a /fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the speci/fic notes.\n\nThe e/ffective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs and discount to redemption value. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.\n\nDuring the year, the Group purchased \u00a3nil of MTNs (2023: \u00a3nil) for a total premium of \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil).\n\nAt 31 March 2024, the Group's committed facilities totalled \u00a32,907m (31 March 2023: \u00a33,007m).\n\n| SYNDICATED AND BILATERAL BANK DEBT   |                                 | Authorised   | Authorised   | Drawn   | Drawn   | Undrawn   | Undrawn   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                      | Maturity as  at 31 March   2024 | 2024 \u00a3m      | 2023 \u00a3m      | 2024 \u00a3m | 2023 \u00a3m | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n| Syndicated debt                      | 2024-27                         | 2,682        | 2,782        | 415     | 383     | 2,267     | 2,399     |\n| Bilateral debt                       | 2026                            | 225          | 225          | -       | -       | 225       | 225       |\n|                                      |                                 | 2,907        | 3,007        | 415     | 383     | 2,492     | 2,624     |",

Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash /flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date.

This note provides further detail on /financial risk management and includes quantitative information on speci/fic /financial risks.\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of /financial risks: market risks (principally interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse e/ffects of these on the Group's /financial performance and includes the use of derivative /financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors, except where the relevant arrangements have been put in place by an individual subsidiary or a joint venture level prior to acquisition.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it intends to hold its /financial assets to collect the contractual cash /flows, or whether it intends to sell them before maturity and classi/fies its /financial instruments into the appropriate categories. The following table summarises the Group's /financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:\n\n|                                                             | 2024 \u00a3m   | Group 2023 \u00a3m   | 2024 \u00a3m   | Company 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                          | 455       | 450             | -         | -                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                   | 78        | 41              | 2         | 2                 |\n| Financial liabilities at amortised cost                     | (4,003)   | (3,750)         | (2,820)   | (2,821)           |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss | 32        | 38              | -         | -                 |\n|                                                             | (3,438)   | (3,221)         | (2,818)   | (2,819)           |\n\n## FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\n\n## (I) CREDIT RISK\n\nThe Group's principal /financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, net investment in /finance leases and amounts due from joint ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that speci/fically relates to each type of asset.\n\n## BANK AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe principal credit risks of the Group arise from /financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and /financial institutions. In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and /financial institutions with a minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and /financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group's treasury function currently performs regular reviews of the credit ratings of all /financial institution counterparties. Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single /financial institution remain within the Group's policy limits.\n\n## TRADE RECEIVABLES\n\nTrade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements, likely deferrals of payments due, agreed rent concessions and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. These assessments are made on a customer by customer basis.\n\nTo limit the Group's exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, a credit report is usually obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty. This report, alongside the Group's internal assessment of credit risk, is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception. In general, these deposits represent between three and six months' rent.",

This is not considered a signi/ficant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good /financial standing.\n\n## (II) LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nThe Group has a well spread maturity pro/file with expected maturities on its MTNs between 2025 and 2057 and diversi/fied shorter-term maturities in commercial paper and committed bank facilities, that are designed to ensure that the Group has su/fficient available funds for its operations, committed capital expenditure programme and re/financing of upcoming MTNs.\n\nManagement monitors the Group's available funds as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | 78         | 41        |\n| Commercial paper                      | (681)      | (312)     |\n| Undrawn facilities                    | 2,492      | 2,624     |\n| Cash and available undrawn facilities | 1,889      | 2,353     |\n| As a proportion of drawn debt 1       | 50.7%      | 68.2%     |\n\n- 1. Based on nominal values, including MTNs and commercial paper.\n\nThe Group's core /financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.\n\n## SECURITY GROUP\n\nThe Group's principal /financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that comprises the majority of the Group's investment properties, development properties and a number of investments in other assets. These arrangements operate in 'tiers' determined by LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR). This structure is most /flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements become more restrictive. No /financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.\n\nAs at 31 March 2024, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 37.0% (2023: 33.0%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and bene/fited from maximum operational /flexibility.\n\nManagement monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis or semi-annual basis, depending on the covenant, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.\n\n## NON-RESTRICTED GROUP\n\nThe Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.",

Due to a combination of factors, including the degree of certainty required under IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the Group does not apply hedge accounting to hedging instruments used in this context. Speci/fic interest-rate hedges are also used from time to time to /fix the interest rate exposure on our debt. Where speci/fic hedges are used to /fix the interest exposure on /floating rate debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nAt 31 March 2024, the Group (including the Group's share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) had pay-/fixed and receive/floating interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of \u00a3864m (2023: \u00a3619m) and forward starting pay-/fixed and receive-/floating interestrate swaps with the accreting notional of up to \u00a31,170m (2023: starting notional of \u00a3940m, increasing to \u00a31,940m). The Group's gross debt (including the Group's share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) was 94.2% /fixed (2023: 98.3%) and based on the Group's debt balances at 31 March 2024, a 1% increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) the annual net /finance expense in the income statement and reduce/(increase) equity by \u00a32m (2023: \u00a31m). The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the /floating rate components of borrowings, interest rate swaps as well as cash and cash equivalents.",

The majority of the Group's foreign currency transactions relate to foreign currency borrowing under the Group's commercial paper programme. It is the Group's policy to hedge 100% of this exposure. At 31 March 2024, the Group had issued \u20ac607m (2023: \u20ac190m) and $185m (2023: $180m) of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil) impact in the income statement and equity arising from foreign currency borrowings.\n\nWhere additional foreign exchange risk is identi/fied (not linked to borrowings), it is the Group's policy to assess the likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk. At 31 March 2024, the Group had no foreign currency exposures (other than those linked to borrowings) being managed using foreign currency derivative contracts (2023: \u00a3nil exposure). A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have no impact on the loss before tax and/or total equity (2023: \u00a3nil impact).\n\n## FINANCIAL MATURITY ANALYSIS\n\nThe interest rate pro/file of the Group's borrowings is set out below (based on notional values):\n\n|           | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating  rate \u00a3m   | 2024 Total \u00a3m   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   |   Floating   rate \u00a3m | 2023 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Sterling  | 2,706             | 431                 | 3,137           | 2,863             |                  383 | 3,246           |\n| Euro      | -                 | 519                 | 519             | -                 |                  167 | 167             |\n| US Dollar | -                 | 147                 | 147             | -                 |                  145 | 145             |\n|           | 2,706             | 1,097               | 3,803           | 2,863             |                  695 | 3,558           |\n\nThe expected maturity pro/files of the Group's borrowings are as follows (based on notional values):\n\n|                                                   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating  rate \u00a3m   | 2024 Total \u00a3m   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating   rate \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| One year or less, or on demand                    | 86                | 973                 | 1,059           | 427               | 312                  | 739             |\n| More than one year but not more than two years    | -                 | 123                 | 123             | 87                | 292                  | 379             |\n| More than two years but not more than /five years | 715               | -                   | 715             | 415               | 91                   | 506             |\n| More than /five years                             | 1,904             | -                   | 1,904           | 1,934             | -                    | 1,934           |\n| Borrowings                                        | 2,705             | 1,096               | 3,801           | 2,863             | 695                  | 3,558           |\n| E/ffect of hedging                                | 864               | (864)               | -               | 619               | (619)                | -               |\n| Borrowings net of interest-rate swaps             | 3,569             | 232                 | 3,801           | 3,482             | 76                   | 3,558           |",

The fair value of the Group's net investment in tenant /finance leases, calculated by the Group's external valuer by applying a weighted average equivalent yield of 7.8% (2023: 7.9%), is \u00a317m (2023: \u00a316m).\n\nThe fair values of any /floating rate /financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value. The fair values of the MTNs fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, the syndicated and bilateral facilities, commercial paper, interest-rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable and receivable under leases fall within Level 3.\n\nThe fair values of the /financial instruments have been determined by reference to relevant market prices, where available. The fair values of the Group's outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash /flows, using appropriate market discount rates. These valuation techniques fall within Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of the other investments is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying entity. The valuation is not based on observable market data and therefore the other investments are considered to fall within Level 3.",

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.\n\nIn determining the expected credit losses, the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. Where a concession is agreed with a customer after the due date for the rent, this amount is recognised as an impairment of the related trade receivable.\n\nTrade and other receivables are written o/ff once all avenues to recover the balances are exhausted and the lease has ended.

As a result, the value of the provisions for impairment of the Group's trade receivables are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. See note 26 for further details of the Group's assessment of the credit risk associated with trade receivables.\n\n|                                                            |   2024 \u00a3m |   2023 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net trade receivables                                      |        46 |        47 |\n| Tenant lease incentives (note 14)                          |       195 |       175 |\n| Prepayments                                                |        58 |        46 |\n| Accrued income                                             |        22 |        11 |\n| Amounts due from joint ventures and associates             |        17 |        39 |\n| Deferred consideration                                     |        16 |        17 |\n| Other receivables                                          |        25 |        30 |\n| Total current trade and other receivables                  |       379 |       365 |\n| Non-current amounts due from joint ventures and associates |       129 |       142 |\n| Deferred consideration                                     |        30 |         4 |\n| Total trade and other receivables                          |       538 |       511 |\n\nThe accounting for lease incentives is set out in note 6.

Provisions are estimated considering various possible outcomes and determining the most likely outcome. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.\n\nIf the e/ffect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that re/flects, when appropriate, the risks speci/fic to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a /finance cost.\n\n|                                                   | Building and  /fire safety  remediation \u00a3m   | Transaction  and contract  related  \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2023                                   | -                                            | -                                        | -          |\n| Transfer from other current liabilities (note 32) | 14                                           | 4                                        | 18         |\n| Charge for the year                               | 12                                           | 45                                       | 57         |\n| Reversed during the year                          | (3)                                          | -                                        | (3)        |\n| At 31 March 2024                                  | 23                                           | 49                                       | 72         |\n| Current                                           | 23                                           | 7                                        | 30         |\n| Non-current                                       | -                                            | 42                                       | 42         |\n| At 31 March 2024                                  | 23                                           | 49                                       | 72         |\n\n## BUILDING AND FIRE SAFETY REMEDIATION PROVISIONS\n\nManagement have assessed their legal and constructive obligations arising from the Building Safety Act 2022 and other associated /fire regulations and remediation works for identi/fied reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.

These provisions are classed together as they pertain to past transactions or contracts executed to acquire or dispose of assets or queries arising therefrom. The provisions re/flect management's best estimate of the costs required to settle these obligations, however owing to the nature of these provisions there is uncertainty over both the amount and the timing of the potential cash out/flows.\n\n## 35 \u203a NET PENSION SURPLUS\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContributions to de/fined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nThe pension obligations arising under the Group's de/fined bene/fit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value. The scheme assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or bene/fit value. The operating and /financing costs of the scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they are identi/fied. Net /financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in /finance income or expense on a net basis. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from either experience di/ffering from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.\n\n## DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES\n\nThe charge to operating pro/fit for the year in respect of de/fined contribution schemes was \u00a34m (2023: \u00a33m).\n\n## DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME\n\nThe Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered de/fined bene/fit /final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Speci/fic Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Scheme's Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the bene/ficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation (including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.\n\nIn setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a quali/fied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The Scheme is closed to new members (and was closed to future accrual on 31 October 2019). A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2021 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP. This valuation was updated to 31 March 2024 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2024.\n\nThere have been no employer or employee contributions following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual on 31 October 2019. Prior to this, the employer contribution rate was 43.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing bene/fits and the employee contributions were at 8% of monthly pensionable salary. It was also agreed that no further de/ficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee contributions were paid by salary sacri/fice, and therefore appeared as Group contributions. The Group does not expect to make any employee or employer contributions to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2025 (2024: \u00a3nil).\n\nAll death-in-service and incapacity bene/fits arising during employment are wholly insured. No post-retirement bene/fits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.\n\n| ANALYSIS OF THE AMOUNTS CHARGED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT   | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Analysis of the amount charged to operating pro/fit       |           |           |\n| Current service costs                                     | -         | -         |\n| Past service costs                                        | -         | -         |\n| Charge to operating pro/fit                               | -         | -         |\n| Analysis of amount credited to net /finance expense       |           |           |\n| Interest income on plan assets                            | (8)       | (6)       |\n| Interest expense on de/fined bene/fit scheme liabilities  | 8         | 6         |\n| Impact on net /finance expense                            | -         | -         |",

This insurance contract is valued as an asset using the same IAS 19 assumptions. Insurance contracts are annuities which are unquoted assets. All other Scheme assets have quoted prices in active markets. The Scheme assets do not include any directly owned /financial instruments issued by the Group. Indirectly owned /financial instruments had a fair value of \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil).\n\nIn the most recent triennial valuation, the de/fined bene/fit scheme liabilities were split nil% (2023: nil%) in respect of active scheme participants, 31% (2023: 26%) in respect of deferred scheme participants, and 69% (2023: 74%) in respect of retirees. As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there are no longer any active scheme participants. The weighted average duration of the de/fined bene/fit scheme liabilities at 31 March 2024 is 11.5 years (2023: 12.0 years).\n\nThe assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation at 30 June 2021 have been restated to the assumptions described by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. The major assumptions used in the valuation were (in nominal terms):\n\n|                                          | 2024  %   | 2023 %   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | n/a       | n/a      |\n| Rate of increase in pensions with no cap | 3.45      | 3.50     |\n| Rate of increase in pensions with 5% cap | 3.30      | 3.35     |\n| Discount rate                            | 4.80      | 4.75     |\n| In/flation - Retail Price Index          | 3.45      | 3.50     |\n| - Consumer Price Index                   | 2.75      | 2.80     |\n\nThe mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:\n\n|                                                                        |   2024  Years |   2023 Years |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners - Men                 |          26.8 |         26.7 |\n| - Women                                                                |          29.1 |         29   |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners (current age 40) - Men |          29.8 |         29.7 |\n| - Women                                                                |          31.9 |         31.8 |",

These were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Scheme liabilities.\n\n| Assumption         | Change in assumption   | Impact on Scheme liabilities   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Discount rate      | Decrease by 0.5%       | Increase by \u00a39m                |\n| Life expectancy    | Increase by 1 year     | Increase by \u00a36m                |\n| Rate of in/flation | Increase by 0.5%       | Increase by \u00a37m                |\n\nThe above sensitivities show the impact on liabilities only and do not re/flect the hedging the Scheme has in place. In December 2022, the Scheme transacted a buy-in policy for \u00a379m covering all remaining uninsured members. As a result, the Group no longer bears any longevity, interest rate or in/flation risk in respect of the pension scheme. The buy-in policy is an investment asset of the Scheme.\n\nThe Company did not operate any de/fined contribution schemes or de/fined bene/fit schemes during the /financial years ended 31 March 2024 or 31 March 2023.\n\nIn June 2023, the UK High Court (Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited) ruled that certain historical amendments for contracted-out de/fined bene/fit schemes were invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial con/firmation. The judgement is subject to appeal. The Trustees and the Group are monitoring developments and will consider if there are any implications for the Scheme, if the ruling is upheld.\n\n## 36 \u203a SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cost of granting shares, options over shares and other share-based remuneration to employees and Executive Directors is recognised through the income statement. All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the awards have Total Shareholder Return (TSR) market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the awards. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.\n\nThe following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with the number of options outstanding.\n\n|                               | Charge  \u00a3m   | 2024 Number  (millions)   | Charge  \u00a3m   | 2023 Number  (millions)   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan      | 3            | 3                         | 3            | 3                         |\n| Deferred Share Bonus Plan     | 2            | -                         | 1            | -                         |\n| Executive Share Option Scheme | -            | 1                         | -            | 1                         |\n| Sharesave Plan                | -            | 1                         | -            | 1                         |\n| Restricted Share Plan         | 3            | 2                         | 2            | 2                         |\n|                               | 8            | 7                         | 6            | 7                         |\n\nA summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below.

In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of 'matching shares' could be made where the individual acquired shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledged to hold them for a period of three years. The awards are issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). The weighted average share price at the date of vesting was 635p (2023: no awards exercised during the year). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a38m (2023: \u00a37m).\n\n## DEFERRED SHARE BONUS PLAN (DSBP)\n\nThe Executive Directors' annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. The shares are usually deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the EBT at nil consideration. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 565p (2023: 615p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2023: \u00a32m).\n\n## OTHER PLANS:\n\n## EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME (ESOS)\n\nThe 2005 ESOS was previously open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP, but was largely replaced by the new Restricted Share Plan in the year ended 31 March 2020. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were no awards exercised during the year (2023: none). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil).\n\n## SHARESAVE PLAN\n\nUnder the Sharesave Plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three or /five year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation less 20% discount. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 641p (2023: 717p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2023: \u00a31m).\n\n## RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN (RSP)\n\nThe RSP started in the year ended 31 March 2020. It is open to qualifying management level employees with awards granted as nil cost options. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the day immediately preceding date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 648p (2023: 697p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a32m (2023: \u00a36m).\n\nThe aggregate number of awards outstanding, and the weighted average exercise price, are shown below:\n\n|                                             | Executive plans 1      | Executive plans 1       |                        |                         | Other plans Weighted average  exercise price   | Other plans Weighted average  exercise price   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | 2024 Number (millions) | 2023 Number  (millions) | 2024 Number (millions) | 2023 Number  (millions) | 2024 Pence                                     | 2023 Pence                                     |\n| At the beginning of the year                | 3                      | 2                       | 3                      | 2                       | 758                                            | 805                                            |\n| Granted                                     | 2                      | 2                       | 1                      | 1                       | 563                                            | 685                                            |\n| Exercised                                   | -                      | -                       | (1)                    | -                       | 540                                            | 736                                            |\n| Lapsed                                      | (1)                    | (1)                     | -                      | -                       | 755                                            | 699                                            |\n| At 31 March                                 | 4                      | 3                       | 3                      | 3                       | 755                                            | 768                                            |\n| Exercisable at the end of the year          | -                      | -                       | 1                      | 1                       | 978                                            | 2,072                                          |\n|                                             | Years                  | Years                   | Years                  | Years                   |                                                |                                                |\n| Weighted average remaining contractual life | 1                      | 1                       | 2                      | 2                       |                                                |                                                |\n\n- 1.

The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon management's best estimate for the e/ffects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.\n\n## FAIR VALUE INPUTS FOR AWARDS WITH MARKET PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nFair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.

In the year ended 31 March 2024, share options are excluded from the weighted average diluted number of shares when calculating EPRA diluted earnings per share because they are not dilutive, based on IFRS loss for the year.\n- 2. EPRA LTV di/ffers from the Group LTV presented in note 21 as it includes net payables and receivables and includes trading properties at fair value and debt instruments at nominal value rather than book value.\n- 3. This measure re/flects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only properties under development.\n- 4. This measure relates to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties currently under development, and is calculated by our external valuer. Topped-up NIY re/flects adjustments of \u00a382m for rent free periods and other incentives.\n- 5. This measure is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable and excluding costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced of \u00a39m. Further information on the Group's accounting policies pertaining to capitalised costs can be found in section 3 of the /financial statements.\n\n## EPRA VACANCY RATE\n\nThe EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for vacant properties versus total estimated market rent, for the Combined Portfolio excluding properties under development.

The forecast minimum PID for the year ended 31 March 2024 is \u00a3181m, which must be paid by 31 March 2025. The Group has already made PID dividends relating to 31 March 2024 of \u00a3181m.\n\nOur latest tax strategy can be found on our corporate website. In the year, the total taxes we incurred and collected were \u00a3136m (2023: \u00a3134m), of which \u00a337m (2023: \u00a338m) was directly borne by the Group including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp duty land tax.

Energy consumption is reported as kWh and no normalisation technique is applied. Carbon emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e). We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in accordance to the WRI GHG Protocol.\n\nGHG emissions are broken down into three scopes: Scope 1, 2 and 3.\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by us that release emissions into the atmosphere, while Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased energy.\n\nAt Landsec, Scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas purchased for common areas and shared services and refrigerant gas losses based on top-ups recorded on our compliance reporting system - Riskwise. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All material sources of Scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported. As the remaining sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions, we do not report them.\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported using both the 'location-based' and 'market-based' accounting methods. Location-based emissions are reported using the UK Government's 'Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2023'. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply, either obtained directly from the supplier or from their o/fficial company website.\n\nScope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our business activities, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classi/fied as Scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identi/fies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec. Our Scope 3 reporting methodology is detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report on landsec.com/sustainability/reports-benchmarking.\n\n| LANDSEC - SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS Emissions   | Unit         | 2021/22   | 2022/23 1   | TABLE 70 2023/24   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Scope 1                                       | tCO 2 e      | 7,151     | 6,950       | 5,809              |\n| Scope 2 (location-based method)               | tCO 2 e      | 18,338    | 16,798      | 17,667             |\n| Scope 2 (market-based method)                 | tCO 2 e      | 2,054     | 2,954       | 2,760              |\n| Scope 1 and 2 (location-based method)         | tCO 2 e      | 25,489    | 23,748      | 23,476             |\n| Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method)           | tCO 2 e      | 9,205     | 9,904       | 8,569              |\n| Intensity                                     | Unit         | 2021/22   | 2022/23     | 2023/24            |\n| Scope 1 and 2 (location-based method)         | kgCO 2 e/m 2 | 14.12     | 12.84       | 13.01              |\n| Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method)           | kgCO 2 e/m 2 | 5.10      | 5.36        | 4.75               |\n\n- 1.

Capital Goods emissions for 2021/22 and 2022/23 have been restated due to previously double-counting emissions for one development project. The following Scope 3 emissions are considered not applicable to us thus excluded from the above table: 8. Upstream leased assets; 9. Downstream transportation and distribution; 10. Processing of sold products; 11. Use of sold products; 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products; 14. Franchises and 15. Investments. Further information is detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report on landsec.com/sustainability/reports-benchmarking.\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have decreased by 1% compared with the previous reporting year. The key reduction driver comes from our energy e/fficiency initiatives across our assets however the impact has been o/ffset by the change of emissions factors, particularly electricity, with a 7% increase compared with last year.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 can be seen in the waterfall chart 71. In terms of market-based emissions, we have seen a reduction of 13% due to an increase of assets under our operational control supplied with REGO-backed renewable electricity.",

The two largest Scope 3 categories are Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, making up over 70% of our total emissions, as shown in chart 73.\n\nCapital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities and portfolio projects. Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.\n\nEmissions from Capital goods have increased by 38% compared with last year due to a combination of portfolio projects, refurbishment works across our sites and in/flation. Overall higher costs impact the proportion of our emissions that are estimated based on procurement spend. We continue making considerable progress in reducing upfront embodied carbon at our developments, as discussed on page 29. Our development pipeline performance which includes our target and performance of upfront embodied carbon is detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\nIn relation to Downstream leased assets, we continue engaging our tenants of our FRI assets and retail brand partners to increase the share of primary tenant energy usage data (69% of our total downstream leased assets data), thereby increasing actual performance data. The small 1% increase in carbon emissions compared with last year for this category is explained by a combination of increase of actual data included in the calculation and increase in electricity emissions factor compared with last year.\n\n| LANDSEC - ENERGY CONSUMPTION   | Unit    |                                       | 2021/22     | 2022/23     | TABLE 74 2023/24   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Natural Gas                    | kWh     | for landlord shared services          | 34,618,470  | 31,202,547  | 28,558,903         |\n|                                |         | (sub)metered to tenants               | 17,627,638  | 19,526,063  | 16,912,876         |\n|                                |         | Total Natural Gas consumption         | 52,246,108  | 50,728,610  | 45,471,779         |\n| Electricity                    | kWh     | for landlord shared services          | 81,414,523  | 82,227,618  | 81,052,747         |\n|                                |         | (sub)metered to tenants               | 48,120,743  | 51,168,404  | 50,356,156         |\n|                                |         | Total Electricity consumption         | 129,535,266 | 133,396,023 | 131,408,903        |\n| District Heating and Cooling   | kWh     | for landlord shared services          | 5,551,710   | 4,973,961   | 5,022,348          |\n|                                |         | (sub)metered to tenants               | 4,170,874   | 4,263,285   | 3,991,868          |\n|                                |         | Total Heating and Cooling consumption | 9,722,584   | 9,237,246   | 9,014,216          |\n| Total Energy Consumption       | kWh     | for landlord shared services          | 121,584,703 | 118,404,126 | 114,633,998        |\n| Total Energy Consumption       |         | (sub)metered to tenants               | 69,919,255  | 74,957,753  | 71,260,900         |\n|                                |         | Total Energy consumption              | 191,503,958 | 193,361,879 | 185,894,898        |\n| Energy intensity               | kWh/m 2 |                                       | 106         | 105         | 103                |\n\nThe table 74 shows the absolute energy consumption with a breakdown by landlord and tenant consumption.

Registration for electronic communications is available via our website on the investor page or on shareview.co.uk .\n\n## PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO UK RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS\n\nDividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account or alternatively sign up to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan (see below). Under this arrangement, dividend con/firmations are still sent to your registered address.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so should contact the Registrar (Equiniti) or complete a mandate instruction available on our website landsec.com/investorsshareholders-equity-investors/ dividend-information and return it to the Registrar. Alternatively, these details can be sent via their Equiniti Shareview online account, which is available on our website on the investors page under shareholders or directly at Equiniti: shareview.co.uk .\n\nFurther information on UK REITs and the forms required to be completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the Landsec website or from the Registrar: landsec.com/ investorsshareholders-equity-investors/uk-reit-regime-anddividends .\n\n## PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO NON-UK RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs applicable to UK resident shareholders, dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account.

Payments via the OPS are made a few days after the Company's dividend payment date - charges are applicable (please review the terms and conditions available online at shareview.co.uk for further information).\n\nShareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to contact the Registrar (Equiniti) on +44 (0)371 384 2030 for an Overseas Payment Service application form or to download the form for their given currency online at shareview.co.uk .\n\n## DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (DRIP)\n\nThe DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity to use cash dividends to increase their shareholding in Landsec. It is a convenient and cost-e/ffective facility provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. Under the DRIP, cash dividends are automatically used to purchase shares in the market as soon as possible after the dividend payment. Any residual cash will be carried forward to the next dividend payment.\n\nDetails of the DRIP, including terms and conditions and participation election forms, are available on our website: landsec.com/ investorsshareholders-equity-investors/dividend-reinvestmentplan-drip .",

It generally includes the net debt of subsidiaries and joint ventures on a proportionate basis.\n\n## Book value\n\nThe amount at which assets and liabilities are reported in the /financial statements.\n\n## Combined Portfolio\n\nThe Combined Portfolio comprises the investment properties of the Group's subsidiaries, on a proportionately consolidated basis when not wholly owned, together with our share of investment properties held in our joint ventures.\n\n## Developments/development pipeline\n\nDevelopment pipeline consists of future developments, committed developments, projects under construction and developments which have reached practical completion within the last two years but are not yet 95% let.\n\n## Development gross yield on total development cost\n\nGross ERV, before adjustment for lease incentives, divided by total development cost. Gross ERV re/flects Landsec's or the valuer's view of expected ERV at completion of the scheme.\n\n## EPRA earnings\n\nPro/fit before tax, excluding pro/fits on the sale of non-current assets and trading properties, pro/fits on development contracts, valuation movements, fair value movements on interest-rate swaps and similar instruments used for hedging purposes, debt restructuring charges, and any other items of an exceptional nature.\n\n## EPRA loan-to-value (LTV)\n\nRatio of adjusted net debt, including net payables, to the sum of the net assets, including net receivables, of the Group, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, all on a proportionate basis, expressed as a percentage. The calculation includes trading properties at fair value and debt at nominal value.\n\n## EPRA net disposal value (NDV) per share\n\nDiluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the impact of goodwill arising as a result of deferred tax, and to include the di/fference between the fair value and the book value of the net investment in tenant /finance leases and /fixed interest rate debt.\n\n## EPRA net initial yield\n\nEPRA net initial yield is de/fined within EPRA's Best Practice Recommendations as the annualised rental income based on the cash rents passing at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property operating expenses, divided by the gross market value of the property. It is consistent with the net initial yield calculated by the Group's external valuer.\n\n## EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (NRV) per share\n\nDiluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the cumulative fair value movements on interest-rate swaps and similar instruments, the carrying value of deferred tax on intangible assets and to include the di/fference between the fair value and the book value of the net investment in tenant /finance leases and add back purchasers' costs.\n\n## EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per share\n\nDiluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the cumulative fair value movements on interest-rate swaps and similar instruments, the carrying value of goodwill arising as a result of deferred tax and other intangible assets, deferred tax on intangible assets and to include the di/fference between the fair value and the book value of the net investment in tenant /finance leases.\n\n## Equivalent yield\n\nCalculated by the Group's external valuer, equivalent yield is the internal rate of return from an investment property, based on the gross outlays for the purchase of a property (including purchase costs), re/flecting reversions to current market rent and such items as voids and non-recoverable expenditure but ignoring future changes in capital value. The calculation assumes rent is received annually in arrears.\n\n## ERV - Gross estimated rental value\n\nThe estimated market rental value of lettable space as determined biannually by the Group's external valuer. For investment properties in the development programme, which have not yet reached practical completion, the ERV represents management's view of market rents.\n\n## Gearing\n\nTotal borrowings, including bank overdrafts, less short-term deposits, corporate bonds and cash, at book value, plus cumulative fair value movements on /financial derivatives as a percentage of total equity. For adjusted gearing, see note 21.\n\n## Gross market value\n\nMarket value plus assumed usual purchaser's costs at the reporting date.\n\n## Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)\n\nA calculation of a company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt. It is calculated using EPRA earnings before interest, divided by net interest (excluding the mark-to-market movement on interestrate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, capitalised interest and interest on the pension scheme assets and liabilities). The calculation excludes joint ventures.\n\n## Investment portfolio\n\nThe investment portfolio comprises the investment properties of the Group's subsidiaries on a proportionately consolidated basis where not wholly owned.\n\n## Lease incentives\n\nAny incentive o/ffered to occupiers to enter into a lease. Typically, the incentive will be an initial rent-free period, or a cash contribution to /fit-out or similar costs. For accounting purposes, the value of the incentive is spread over the non-cancellable life of the lease.\n\n## Like-for-like portfolio\n\nThe like-for-like portfolio includes all properties which have been in the portfolio since 1 April 2021 but excluding those which are acquired or sold since that date. Properties in the development pipeline and completed developments are also excluded.\n\n## Loan-to-value (LTV)\n\nGroup LTV is the ratio of adjusted net debt, including subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the sum of the market value of investment properties and the book value of trading properties of the Group, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, all on a proportionate basis, expressed as a percentage. For the Security Group, LTV is the ratio of net debt lent to the Security Group divided by the value of secured assets.\n\n## Market value\n\nMarket value is determined by the Group's external valuer, in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards, as an opinion of the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction after proper marketing.\n\n## Net initial yield\n\nNet initial yield is a calculation by the Group's external valuer of the yield that would be received by a purchaser, based on the Estimated Net Rental Income expressed as a percentage of the acquisition cost, being the market value plus assumed usual purchasers' costs at the reporting date. The calculation is in line with EPRA guidance. Estimated Net Rental Income is determined by the valuer and is based on the passing cash rent less rent payable at the balance sheet date, estimated non-recoverable outgoings and void costs including service charges, insurance costs and void rates.\n\n## Net rental income\n\nNet rental income is the net operational income arising from properties, on an accruals basis, including rental income, /finance lease interest, rents payable, service charge income and expense, other property related income, direct property expenditure and bad debts. Net rental income is presented on a proportionate basis.\n\n## Net zero carbon building\n\nA building for which an overall balance has been achieved between carbon emissions produced and those taken out of the atmosphere, including via o/ffset arrangements. This relates to operational emissions for all buildings while, for a new building, it also includes supply-chain emissions associated with its construction.\n\n## Passing rent\n\nThe estimated annual rent receivable as at the reporting date which includes estimates of turnover rent and estimates of rent to be agreed in respect of outstanding rent review or lease renewal negotiations. Passing rent may be more or less than the ERV (see over-rented, reversionary and ERV). Passing rent excludes annual rent receivable from units in administration save to the extent that rents are expected to be received. Void units at the reporting date are deemed to have no passing rent. Although temporary lets of less than 12 months are treated as void, income from temporary lets is included in passing rents.\n\n## Property Income Distribution (PID)\n\nA PID is a distribution by a REIT to its shareholders paid out of qualifying pro/fits. A REIT is required to distribute at least 90% of its qualifying pro/fits as a PID to its shareholders.",

It is stated gross, prior to the deduction of ground rents and without deduction for operational outgoings on car park and commercialisation activities.\n\n## Reversionary or under-rented\n\nSpace where the passing rent is below the ERV.\n\n## Reversionary yield\n\nThe anticipated yield to which the initial yield will rise (or fall) once the rent reaches the ERV.\n\n## Security Group\n\nSecurity Group is the principal funding vehicle for the Group and properties held in the Security Group are mortgaged for the bene/fit of lenders. It has the /flexibility to raise a variety of di/fferent forms of /finance.\n\n## Topped-up net initial yield\n\nTopped-up net initial yield is a calculation by the Group's external valuer. It is calculated by making an adjustment to net initial yield in respect of the annualised cash rent foregone through unexpired rent-free periods and other lease incentives. The calculation is consistent with EPRA guidance.\n\n## Total return on equity\n\nDividend paid per share in the year plus the change in EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share, divided by EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Total cost ratio\n\nTotal cost ratio represents all costs included within EPRA earnings, other than rents payable, /financing costs and provisions for bad and doubtful debts, expressed as a percentage of gross rental income before rents payable adjusted for costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced.\n\n## Total development cost (TDC)\n\nTotal development cost refers to the book value of the site at the commencement of the project, the estimated capital expenditure required to develop the scheme from the start of the /financial year in which the property is added to our development programme, together with capitalised interest, being the Group's borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on the property under development. Interest is also capitalised on the purchase cost of land or property where it is acquired speci/fically for redevelopment. The TDC for trading property development schemes excludes any estimated tax on disposal.\n\n## Trading properties\n\nProperties held for trading purposes and shown as current assets in the balance sheet.\n\n## Vacancy rates\n\nVacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of ERV and represent all unlet space, including vacant properties where refurbishment work is being carried out and vacancy in respect of pre-development properties, unless the scale of refurbishment is such that the property is not deemed lettable.

The market value of the Combined Portfolio is determined by the Group's external valuer.\n\n## Voids\n\nVoids are expressed as a percentage of ERV and represent all unlet space, including voids where refurbishment work is being carried out and voids in respect of pre-development properties. Temporary lettings for a period of one year or less are also treated as voids. The screen at Piccadilly Lights, W1 is excluded from the void calculation as it will always carry advertising although the number and duration of our agreements with advertisers will vary. Commercialisation lettings are also excluded from the void calculation.\n\n## Weighted average unexpired lease term\n\nThe weighted average of the unexpired term of all leases other than short-term lettings such as car parks and advertising hoardings, temporary lettings of less than one year, residential leases and long ground leases.",
