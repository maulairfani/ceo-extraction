For detail on any APMs used see the Finance review on page 50.\n\n## Navigating a challenging market environment\n\nFour years after the outbreak of Covid-19, our markets have continued to see the ripple effects of the pandemic. The chemical industry has experienced a prolonged period of destocking, following on immediately from a period where customers rapidly increased inventory levels to meet surging demand as lockdowns were lifted.\n\n## Delivering long-term performance\n\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates and customer destocking had a significant effect on Croda's financial performance in 2023 and the Board took the decision to issue two unscheduled trading updates through the year as the trading environment deteriorated. Overall pro forma sales were down 11%, adjusting for the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses on 30 June 2022, and operating profit was down 33%.\n\nDespite this disappointing financial performance, we have seen continued customer demand for Croda's innovation and ingredients that are differentiated by their sustainability credentials. Both Consumer Care and Life\n\nSciences have more than doubled their annual sales in the period since I became Chair in 2015 through a combination of organic growth and portfolio development, and our customer net promoter score has improved further from +23 in 2022 to +34 in 2023 according to the latest survey.\n\nMost importantly, we have delivered continued progress in a difficult market environment whilst caring for each other right across our company. Despite the challenges we faced in 2023, we maintained our overall employee engagement score at 68%, with 71% of our people saying that they would recommend Croda as a place to work. We are continuing to improve our safety record and made good progress towards achieving our goal of embedding safety as a value, spending over 4,500 hours coaching more than 500 senior leaders globally.\n\nOur commitment to providing regular returns to shareholders is demonstrated by the Board's decision to increase the 2023 full year dividend, despite lower adjusted earnings. During my tenure as Chair, we have increased the dividend from 69p for full year 2015 to 109p for 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 6% over that eight-year period.\n\n## Strong fundamentals\n\nCroda is built on exceptionally strong fundamentals. This includes our Purpose which guides the strategic choices we make, a culture where we put people first and an established business model which enables successful implementation of our strategy.\n\nOur Purpose, Smart science to improve lives TM , is the bedrock of our approach and is embedded across our company through our strategy and our approach to governance, risk and remuneration. By achieving our strategy we will deliver growth in our own business while creating positive impacts for the planet and society. Our governance framework covers both financial and non-financial performance, our appetite to risk is higher where that risk is integral to delivering on our Purpose and our Remuneration Policy incorporates sustainability-related targets.\n\nUnited by our strong sense of Purpose and our values, we work as one team. We also promote a 'One Croda' culture through our Remuneration Policy and high levels of employee share ownership.\n\nCroda has a well-established and powerful business model, founded on our own local, science-focused sales force. This direct selling model builds relationships with customers and provides us with insights about their challenges that are key to how we innovate.\n\n## Proven strategic direction\n\nFollowing Croda's significant strategic transition over recent years, we have a compelling focused portfolio operating in attractive market niches, with long-term technology trends creating valuable growth opportunities.\n\nIn the Consumer Care market, sustainability is the biggest single driver over the next decade, accelerating the demand for sustainable ingredients and driving legislation change.

These long-term growth drivers have remained intact in the challenging environment that we have seen in 2023 and our strategy is to leverage our leadership in innovation and sustainability to capture the opportunities for growth that they are creating.\n\nDespite a tough year, we have continued to invest in R&D and manufacturing capacity. We started construction of three new manufacturing sites in China, India and the USA. We continued to invest in R&D in our fast-growing markets including China, Singapore, and Brazil and we opened up a new technical centre for our Pharma business in Hyderabad, India. We also welcomed Solus Biotech to the Croda family with exciting new growth platforms in ceramides and phospholipids that will contribute to our future growth.\n\nExecution against our sustainability agenda, which is central to our strategy, has continued with the objective of delivering restorative impact throughout our value chain and in wider society. We remain on track to meet our 2030 Science Based Targets for greenhouse gas emissions and the Croda Foundation has sustainably improved the lives of more than 22 million people since the charity was founded in 2021. We also established a Board Sustainability Oversight Committee this year to guide and monitor progress.\n\n## Focused on operational improvements\n\nOur focus in 2023 has been on 'controlling what we can control' to protect profitability alongside longer-term improvement programmes to drive efficiency savings by simplifying business processes and ways of working. This focus will ensure Croda is positioned to recover when the macro-environment improves.\n\nA new organisational structure has been effective since the start of 2024 with all regional teams, including sales, R&D, marketing, customer service and manufacturing, reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This simplifies how we work and will ensure we deliver more quickly and more efficiently for our customers.\n\nProfit-protection measures and changes to our ways of working have created further change and challenges for our employees in addition to tough trading conditions. Throughout 2023, our people have demonstrated their resilience, adaptability and determination and I wanted to take a moment to share my thanks and appreciation with everyone at Croda.\n\nA number of the improvements to business processes have been led by Louisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who informed us in December that she has accepted a new role as CFO at Spirax-Sarco Plc and so will be leaving Croda in June 2024. We are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she will have our very best wishes when she departs this summer. In the meantime, she is continuing to make a valuable contribution to our future success by establishing a functionally-led finance organisation, leading the upgrade of our systems and driving other important improvements to the way we operate. The search for her successor is well underway and we will make a further announcement in due course.\n\n'Execution against our sustainability agenda, which is central to our strategy, has continued with the objective of delivering restorative impact throughout our value chain and in wider society.'\n\n## Looking back and looking forwards\n\nThis will be my last letter to shareholders as I am stepping down as Croda Chair at the conclusion of Croda's AGM on 24 April 2024. The Board has appointed Danuta Gray as my successor, who is currently Chair of Direct Line Insurance Group Plc and a Non-Executive Director at Burberry Group Plc. Danuta has held Board positions across a range of sectors for the past 19 years and has a deep understanding of growing consumer focused and technology-rich businesses in international markets. Danuta has already joined the Board so I have already had the opportunity to start handing over the reins to her.\n\n## Croda Foundation 'Neverthirst' project\n\nImproving access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation in rural Uganda\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we established the Croda Foundation, an independent charitable company funded solely by grants from Croda. The Foundation's priority impact areas include improving access to healthcare, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and reducing hunger and poverty while improving livelihoods. Since 2021, the Foundation has sustainably improved the lives of more than 22 million people, funding 34 projects across 21 countries. One of these projects is improving access to clean water, basic hygiene and sanitation in rural Uganda, upgrading infrastructure, and training 250 people on improving sanitation through building their own household latrine.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have never wavered from that commitment and I am pleased that the high standards of corporate governance at Croda were recognised in the recent independent Board review. Our achievements as a Board and as a company have benefitted from the contribution of all Board Directors past and present to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks.\n\nIn 2015, I was one of only two female Board members.

She has extensive Non-Executive listed company Board experience having previously been Chair of St Modwen Property Plc and also serving on the Boards of Aldermore Bank Plc, Old Mutual Plc, Page Group Plc, Paddy Power Plc and Aer Lingus Plc.\n\nThis transition has involved continued investment and multiple acquisitions during my tenure and has opened exciting new growth opportunities for the business.\n\nIt has been a great privilege to serve as your Chair and I am proud of the progress we have made.

These ingredients deliver vital functionality and downstream benefits at low inclusion levels, giving us a strong competitive advantage. We operate globally with a focus on high-value niches in consumer care and life science markets. We work closely with customers at every stage of the value chain and aim to enhance our reputation for innovation, sustainability and quality in everything that we do.\n\n- Read more about how we are driving positive impacts and operational excellence across the value chain on page 14\n\n## The solutions we provide\n\nDriven by our Commitment to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients\n\n## Consumer Care\n\n## Life Sciences\n\nWe develop innovative and sustainable ingredients that provide vital functionality to consumer care formulations, enabling customers to differentiate their products, build strong brands, meet their sustainability commitments and satisfy changing consumer requirements. For example, we extract wrinkle-reducing actives from plants that are critical ingredients in anti-ageing skin creams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 38\n\nSee page 42\n\nSee page 42\n\n## Climate Positive\n\nWe are successfully leading our sector in delivering absolute reductions in our GHG emissions, in line with our verified 1.5\u00baC Science Based Target. We are working to provide our customers with the verified product-level carbon footprint data that, together with the reduced and avoided emissions in use that our technologies can bring, will help them deliver on their climate targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 34\n\nSee page 34\n\nSee page 35\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pharma\n\nWe develop components and systems for the delivery of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), supporting customers across the whole lifecycle of a drug - from early-stage research to commercial manufacture. For example, our ingredients encapsulate the mRNA used in vaccines allowing it to be transported into human cells.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Land Positive\n\nUsing natural resources brings with it the responsibility to take a holistic approach to the role natural ecosystems play in achieving global climate goals while addressing social inequalities. We are already Land Positive - with our crop and seed technologies saving more land than is used to grow our bio-based raw materials, and are working to deliver on our aspiration to contribute to a Nature Positive world by 2030.\n\n## People Positive\n\nOur People Positive commitments impact both our employees and wider society. We deploy our smart science to improve the lives of people around the world, targeting vaccine solutions to the most challenging diseases and protecting millions of people from damage caused by the sun. Internally, we recognise the value diversity of thought brings to our organisation and our responsibility to reward fairly and look after the health, safety and wellbeing of every employee.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nWe are an innovation partner to major crop science companies and an increasing number of smaller customers, developing delivery systems to meet the sustainability challenges of current-generation products and to enable nextgeneration solutions.

We commercialise and develop their skills and knowledge to drive a high return on sales. The employee base is expanding globally, with notable growth in sciencebased roles and increasing workforce diversity.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nRaw material costs constitute approximately 35% of our sales. Our raw materials primarily comprise bio-based (rather than petrochemical-derived) resources, including grown commodities and natural oils. Overall, raw material costs fell in 2023, following a period of significant inflation in 2021-22.\n\n## Sites and infrastructure\n\nWe invest 6-8% of sales in capital expenditure annually to maintain, develop, and decarbonise our sites and infrastructure. Targeted organic investments are being made to scale up our pharmaceutical technology platforms.\n\n## Capital\n\nOur capital requirements are primarily met through loans and credit facilities, including a sustainable banking facility, with no significant debt maturing before 2026. Our leverage ratio of 1.3x net debt to EBITDA is at the lower end of our targeted range of 1-2x over the medium-term cycle, providing flexibility for future organic growth and potential acquisitions.\n\n## 1. 'One Croda' culture\n\nUnited by our strong sense of Purpose and our values, we work as one team. We promote a 'One Croda' culture through our Remuneration Policy and high levels of employee share ownership. We strive to be more agile and entrepreneurial than our competitors, with a decentralised operating model that ensures decisions are made 'close to customers'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See pages 16-17\n\n## 2. Customer intimacy\n\nWe employ our own local, science-focused sales force who understand our customers, rather than using distributors. This direct selling model builds relationships with customers and provides us with insights about their challenges that are key to how we innovate. We complement direct selling with local innovation centres where we co-formulate with customers to accelerate their time-to-market. This intimacy coupled with innovation enables us to anticipate future demands faster than our competition, particularly more disruptive market changes, such as the demand for sustainable ingredients and solutions from novel technologies.\n\n## 3. Innovation leadership\n\nWe are the leading innovator in our markets with a technology portfolio differentiated by protected intellectual property and know-how, including over 1,600 patents across more than 275 patent families. This means our ingredients have unique attributes and deliver higher value to our customers. We have a collaborative, open innovation model which combines internal R&D with partnering and technology acquisitions.\n\n## R&D\n\nIn 2023, we allocated \u00a362m to in-house innovation. This investment is supplemented by a robust pipeline of technology acquisitions and over 500 open innovation partnerships. These collaborations with universities, SMEs and leading scientists enhance our R&D capabilities and provide access to specialised expertise and facilities.\n\n## Supply chain and logistics\n\nA global network of local warehouses ensures efficient delivery of ingredients to customers worldwide, despite recent global supply chain challenges. We have actively managed down our finished goods inventory back to pre-Covid levels.\n\n## Energy\n\nEnergy costs represent approximately 3% of our sales. Our efficient use of energy, sourced from diverse internal and external sources, minimises its proportion in our cost structure. Renewable energy was 37% of total energy use in 2023.\n\n## Regulations\n\nOperating globally, we adhere to relevant regulations governing our product ingredients and applications, with regulatory change often driving requirements for our innovation. Active involvement in shaping regulations and standards, alongside collaborative efforts with industry partners, helps maintain product efficacy, increase competitive advantage and build stakeholder confidence.\n\n## 4. Sustainability leadership\n\nWith a heritage of using natural raw materials and providing sustainable solutions, we have embedded a long-term sustainability strategy in the way we work to ensure we deliver on our Commitment to be the world's most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients by 2030. With consumers and other end-customers keen to make a positive impact through their purchasing decisions, the creation of sustainable ingredients and offering sustainability claims through the use of our products are key drivers of our future commercial success.\n\n## 5. Our approach to growth\n\nOur growth strategy is focused on pioneering new market and technology niches where our leadership in innovation and sustainability allows us to compete on value rather than on price.\n\nWe operate flexible, capital-light manufacturing sites, rather than large continuous operation plans, producing ingredients in test tube quantities rather than tanker loads. Our principal focus is on driving the continued differentiation of our portfolio through innovation and sustainability. In parallel, we prioritise sales volumes in those parts of the portfolio where there is less differentiation to underpin consistent plant utilisation.\n\nThere is no one big competitor that spans all our markets; instead, there are different competitors in each of our niches. We have a broad base of customers, large and small, and a high number of customer/ product combinations which reduces our exposure to any specific customer, market or geography.",

Our people can have engaging and rewarding careers, undertaking meaningful purpose-driven work that has a positive impact on society and the environment. We regularly engage with employees through surveys, listening groups and other face-to-face engagement mechanisms, to understand their perspective, recognising that our people drive the future success of our business. Key topics of engagement in 2023 included safety, cost-of-living support, the challenging trading environment and need to control costs, and the impact of our new operating model. With the majority of employees actively participating in share schemes, we benefit from strong alignment of interests between stakeholders.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nWe are committed to fair payment practices but also partner with suppliers to help improve sustainability practices in supply chains. This includes helping them to understand our requirements on supply chain transparency, ethics, and human rights, with suppliers assessed through EcoVadis assessments. By 2023 83% of key suppliers by volume had been assessed by EcoVadis. With most of our carbon emissions embedded in our supply chain, engagement with suppliers to understand emissions data is critical in providing Product Carbon Footprint data to customers, but our focus goes beyond carbon, with a commitment to be Net Nature Positive and to reduce impacts on biodiversity.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nWe aim to deliver consistent top and bottom-line growth in a way that benefits the environment and society, which should deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the long term. We engage extensively with shareholders to help them understand our performance and strategy and to gain insight that can help guide our thinking. In 2023, engagement included discussions on the challenging trading conditions and the impact on financial performance. We also continued to engage on our non-financial performance and strategy, reflecting the importance of ESG practices to our investors.\n\n## NGOs\n\nActing responsibly ensures we satisfy regulatory requirements, protect our reputation and extend our positive impact through our influence within trade associations and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We engage with various NGOs on topics including upcoming regulations, supply chain sustainability and human rights both directly and through membership of industry working groups and task forces. This includes our work as part of Together for Sustainability, a consortia of chemical companies working to improve sustainability practices. In 2023, 88% of palm oil derivative volumes were RSPO certified.\n\n## Customers and consumers\n\nWith sales of more than 6,000 products to more than 15,000 customers, our solutions enable a broad range of customers to differentiate their products. Our customers value our product quality, responsive sales teams, technical support, and the impact that our innovative and sustainable ingredients can have. We engage regularly with customers through our direct selling model and through customer surveys with over 3,000 responses received in 2023. Our customer NPS increased by 11 points to +34 in 2023 and sits within the category of 'Great', reflecting our desire to be close to customers. Engagement in 2023 often covered stock management, online service and recent innovation.\n\n## Innovation partners\n\nOur innovation activities include collaboration with academia, SMEs and our customers to accelerate innovation. Our shared knowledge enables our innovation partners to secure funding, advance science and make breakthroughs, ultimately helping us to grow sales of New and Protected Products as we commercialise this innovation. To date nearly 600 innovation partners have collaborated on over 300 innovation projects. Engagement topics in 2023 included sustainable innovation, leveraging biotechnology and green chemistry.\n\n## Communities\n\nWe support local communities through educational outreach and provide access to our smart science through the Croda Foundation, working to ensure that the local communities where we operate benefit from our presence. In 2023 Croda employees donated 5,310 hours of their time volunteering in local communities through the 1% Club and by the end of the year the Croda Foundation had improved the lives of more than 22 million people. Our community liaison activities are localised, ensuring our communities can engage on the issues significant to them.\n\n## Section 172(1) statement\n\nThe Board of Directors confirms that during the year under review, it has acted to promote the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders, whilst having due regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006, being:\n\n- \u00b7  the likely consequences of any decision in the long term\n- \u00b7  the interests of the Company's employees\n- \u00b7  the need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others\n- \u00b7  the impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment\n- \u00b7  the desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct\n- \u00b7  the need to act fairly between members of the Company.\n\nThe information on pages 14 to 15 in the Strategic Report should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Directors' Report on pages 78 to 81.

Our values of Responsible, Innovative and Together and their associated competencies guide everything we do and are reinforced through our performance reviews, succession, and talent planning and through organisational change.\n\n## Behavioural competency model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023 we have continued to focus on accelerating growth, embedding the behaviours, skills and capabilities to help foster an organisation that acts responsibly, develops cutting-edge innovation, and works together as 'One Croda'. We also transitioned to a new simplified organisational structure from the start of 2024, with Consumer Care and Life Sciences now responsible for both longerterm strategic development and operational delivery. This will improve accountability and create a more agile and responsive business to support our future growth ambitions (see page 31).\n\n## Measuring culture\n\nOur Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey, introduced in 2022, helps us gain insight into how employees feel about aspects of Croda's culture. Alongside town hall meetings and listening groups, the insight we gain is invaluable and helps us identify focus areas to improve employee experience and engagement. Overall, our PSC score for 2023 was 68%, flat against 2022, despite the challenging trading environment leading to increased pressure on our people.\n\n## 71%\n\nof employees are highly likely to recommend Croda as a great place to work to family and friends\n\n## 75%\n\nof employees overall enjoy the work that they do\n\n## 76%\n\nof employees are highly likely to see leaders and managers guiding them to achieve their activities safely\n\n## 79%\n\nof employees overall work to deliver their best as efficiently as they can\n\nLooking below the headline score, we saw encouraging responses in areas for improvement that were identified in 2022 and became our focus for 2023. Reward and recognition saw improved responses, in part reflecting the cost-of-living pressures and our actions to support employees including one-off support payments, as well as the introduction of the Free Share Plan in 2021.\n\nEmployees' ability to get involved with activities outside of their role and to focus on self-led development were scored less positively in 2023 but remained 'good'. We view this as a symptom of the requirement to focus on delivering value in a challenging year. Although feedback suggests employees feel their workloads are more manageable, we believe we have more work to do in ensuring employees have time to be curious, develop and to get involved in employee-led activities that contribute to our culture.\n\nWe have already laid the foundations to improve with changes implemented to our hiring and talent planning activities in 2023. For instance, we implemented Competency Insights profiles for new hires to aid in the review of areas for initial development for new employees. In talent planning, departments worked with HR Business Partners to highlight potential career paths, aligned to the competences and skills needed in different roles and different areas of the business. This gives employees a clearer idea of where to focus their development activities and helps managers have more meaningful development conversations.\n\nReporting Data Pack 2023: All people-related data is included in our Reporting Data Pack which is available at www.croda.com.

Our EVP focuses on:\n\n## Developing our people\n\nThe development and retention of high-quality people with the curiosity and ability to challenge conventional thinking and to further innovation ultimately determines the success of our business. Central to our philosophy is self-led development with extensive learning resources made available to our people. Our target is for all employees to receive at least one week's training in 2024, with our people collectively undertaking over 197,000 hours of training in 2023, equivalent to 33.7 hours of training per employee (2022: 26.1 hours). Our leadership development programmes offer a more structured approach to development with around 170 high-potential individuals participating in development programmes in 2023, with all those selected exhibiting model behaviours aligned with our values.\n\n## Wellbeing and safety\n\nOur leaders worked on embedding safety as a value in 2023, recognising that while priorities change, our values endure and guide how we behave. Through a tailored programme, more than 500 leaders have collectively undertaken over 4,500 hours of safety training aimed at building confidence around safety leadership and driving debate on safety. Scores for safety-orientated questions in our PSC questionnaires have improved, indicating that this focus is impacting how employees are feeling and interacting on safety initiatives. Our Total Recordable Injury Rate improved in 2023 (see page 35) but remains too high and we hope improving sentiment and focus on safety by employees is a positive leading indicator.\n\n## Our development programmes:\n\nLeadership Development Group plus: For established senior colleagues in key roles, who may have completed other development programmes\n\nLeadership Development Group: High performing, high potential senior colleagues\n\nAccelerated Leadership Programme: High performing, mid-level colleagues showing leadership behaviours\n\nLeading with purpose: A values-aligned development programme available to all grades\n\nPhoenix Rising: For a cross section of colleagues looking to unlock potential and/or increase contribution - participants must display a strong commitment to inclusion and self development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reward and recognition\n\nWe are committed to paying all employees a Global Living Wage and work closely with the Fair Wage Network to ensure employees continue to be paid more than this. Our reward framework supports our 'One Croda' culture with performance metrics for bonus schemes aligned across the Group. In addition, our Free Share Plan awards shares to employees who do not participate in our senior annual Bonus Plan when an award under this Bonus Plan is made, ensuring everyone shares in our success. Recent surveys indicate access to generous employee share plans is valued, with 83% of UK employees and 71% of non-UK employees participating in these schemes. Employees can also enjoy non-financial benefits, such as free healthcare plans, flexible working and other wellbeing focused benefits.\n\n## A collaborative and supportive workplace\n\nWe embrace our differences, nurturing an inclusive and supportive culture where everyone feels valued, respected and empowered to contribute. Employee-led diversity and inclusion networks support us in raising awareness, creating connections and ensuring that all aspects of diversity are considered in decision-making. Our 1% club allows employees to spend working hours contributing to local communities, with 5,310 hours donated in 2023. Our voluntary employee turnover remains below industry averages and in 2023 was 9.1% (2022: 8.5%), a small increase against the prior year reflecting the difficult trading environment in 2023 and near-term uncertainty.\n\n## Positive impact through sustainable innovation\n\nA key aspect of Croda's success is a can-do entrepreneurial spirit that pervades through our business. Our people have the freedom to find solutions, explore new ideas and collaborate to drive positive change, something that is celebrated through our annual 'Purpose in Action' awards. As a celebration of those who embody our Purpose and have a positive impact, the awards, hosted by Group Chief Executive, Steve Foots, recognise individuals and teams. In 2023, there were 98 projects nominated - many of which were employee-led initiatives born out of a drive to solve problems. The opportunity to have a positive impact through sustainable innovation is often a key factor in employees joining and staying with Croda.",

It follows a record performance in 2021 and 2022 when the Group significantly benefitted from customers building up inventory levels in the face of strong consumer demand, escalating prices and supply chain disruption. As central banks raised interest rates to manage inflation and market conditions softened, customers subsequently reduced inventory levels, albeit at different times across the different market segments and geographies that we serve. For Croda and the wider chemical industry, this resulted in a prolonged period of destocking that was unprecedented in the breadth of its impact across most markets, compounded by a slower economic recovery in China than some of our customers had anticipated.\n\nAs a consequence, sales volumes were down across all sectors. Adjusting for the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business to Cargill on 30 June 2022, Group sales fell by 11% on a pro forma basis to \u00a31,694.5m (2022 pro forma (pf): \u00a31,898m), comprising positive price/mix, lower volumes, a contribution for the Solus Biotech acquisition completed in July and a small headwind from currency translation.\n\nIn 2023, average customer inventories were below 2022 levels but remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Consumer Care, indications are that destocking has largely worked its way through the supply chain with a slow improvement in sales volumes in the year. By contrast, weak industrial demand globally impacted Industrial Specialties where volumes remained weak. Similarly, customers in agriculture markets continued to reduce inventory levels throughout the second half year having started destocking in the second quarter, later than in other markets. In Pharma, our ability to react quickly with valuable lipid technology allowed us to support mRNA vaccine sales through the Covid-19 pandemic. Inevitably, as Covid demand fell, this resulted in lower shipments in 2023, contributing to just over half of the Life Sciences variance from prior year, but we still supplied c.$60m of Covid lipids in 2023 (2022: c.$120m). The Covid experience did allow us to establish our technology and provided us with valuable insights, facilitating resilient non-Covid sales as customer drug pipelines continue to develop.\n\nSignificant volume declines across most of our markets at a similar time led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our manufacturing sites, particularly those that produce ingredients for multiple business units, with negative operating leverage impacting profit margins. Whilst there are likely to be some bounce-back costs as trading normalises, there are also opportunities for margin expansion from higher sales volumes and improved mix particularly if the recovery is broad-based across our markets.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3247.5m (2022: \u00a3444.7m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a3320.0m (2022 pf: \u00a3476m), adjusting for the one-off exceptional items outlined in the Finance review. The adjusted operating margin of 18.9% (2022 pf: 25%) was negatively impacted by the operating leverage effect of the reduction in volumes and lower sales of high-margin lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. Profit before tax (on an IFRS basis) was \u00a3236.3m (2022: \u00a3780.0m), with the prior year including a gain on the PTIC business divestment of \u00a3356.0m, and adjusted profit before tax was \u00a3308.8m (2022 pf: \u00a3463m).\n\nDespite the impact of the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, the technology trends that will drive our future growth have not changed with a continued transition to sustainable ingredients and biologics. We have successfully realigned our portfolio with these megatrends and are making strategic progress with continued investment through the downturn in R&D and capacity. Demand for innovation has remained strong among our customers, which will be key to driving a recovery in Croda's performance as the macro-environment improves. Sales of New and Protected Products (NPP) held up well at 34% of total sales (2022: 35%), with an increase in the proportion of NPP sales in Consumer Care. Customer demand for our ingredients that are differentiated by their sustainability characteristics has also been resilient with sales of ECO surfactants, for example, up by more than 20% year-on-year.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by the progress we have continued to deliver in our non-financial performance. We remain on track to meet our 2030 Science Based Targets for emissions reduction, the Croda Foundation has already sustainably improved the lives of more than 22 million people and we delivered more than 4,500 hours of training to leaders as we embed safety as a value. Our sustainability leadership was recognised by CDP, which awarded us leadership status for the first time, complementing our long-standing triple A rating from MSCI.",

        "page_content": "## Managing challenging market conditions\n\nTo mitigate the impact of tough trading conditions, we took some immediate actions to actively manage cash flow and address costs to protect profitability, while increasing customer sales activity to drive incremental sales growth. Production schedules were optimised to meet lower demand, reducing energy and freight costs. Underlying employee costs were broadly flat as inflation-based salary increases were offset by a hiring freeze and natural attrition. In addition, Group margin benefitted by one and a half percentage points due to negligible charges for variable remuneration. Cash flow improved through proactive management of working capital and our balance sheet remains strong, enabling us to pay an increased full year dividend and to continue to invest the \u00a3665m proceeds from the divestment of PTIC, the business we sold in 2022.\n\nAlongside these temporary cost reduction measures, we have been driving improvements that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational effectiveness over the longer term. Priorities have included consolidating our site footprint and delivering our 'doing the basics brilliantly' programme to drive ongoing efficiencies. This programme will improve customer experience and employee productivity through a combination of customer insights, digital technology, and streamlined processes. Our customer net promoter score (NPS) has improved further from +23 in 2022 to +34 in 2023.\n\nFollowing rapid portfolio transition in recent years through the acquisitions and divestments we have made, a new organisational structure has been in place since the start of 2024 to further streamline our operating model. Previously, the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors were responsible for strategy whereas the regions were responsible for performance. Now, all regional teams, including sales, R&D, marketing, customer service and manufacturing, report directly into Consumer Care and Life Sciences. The Presidents of these sectors are now fully accountable for their performance and strategy including innovation, sustainability and the acquisition of technologies aligned with our strategic priorities. This clarifies accountability, simplifies the organisation for our employees, is more cost efficient and will ensure we deliver faster and more effectively for our customers, positioning us well to take advantage of the recovery.\n\n## Regional summary\n\nKey drivers of performance were similar globally in 2023, notably a slow but steady improvement in Consumer Care in the second half year as customers worked through heightened inventory levels but a weakening performance in Life Sciences mainly driven by rapid destocking by Crop Protection customers which began in the second quarter. Performance in Asia reflected these global drivers, with Consumer Care improving and Life Sciences weakening during the year. Despite demand in China not recovering as quickly as some of our customers had anticipated, our direct Consumer Care sales to China were robust, partly owing to strong relationships with regional customers who value our innovation expertise. Sales fell in North America although the declines were less significant in the second half year and we began to win back some sales in Consumer Care which were lost in 2022 through our inability to supply ingredients for certain periods. Consumer Care sales grew in Europe, particularly in Beauty Care and Home Care. Latin America was the strongest region but saw adverse impacts from destocking in Crop Protection as well as significant currency movements during the second half year.\n\n## Sector summary\n\n## Consumer Care - leadership in innovation and sustainability driving demand\n\nConsumer Care sales fell 1% to \u00a3886.1m (2022: \u00a3897.8m) with strong double-digit percentage sales growth in Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) but lower underlying sales in Beauty Actives, Beauty Care and Home Care. Price/mix was up 2%, mainly due to a positive mix impact from Beauty Actives, with pricing broadly flat. Sales volumes were down 4%\n\nyear-on-year but were up 9% in the second half year compared with the second half of 2022. Acquisitions added 1% due to sales of ceramides following the Solus Biotech acquisition, with foreign currency translation a small headwind for the full year.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3127.8m (2022: \u00a3144.5m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a3160.3m (2022: \u00a3204.7m), resulting in adjusted operating margin reducing to 18.1% (2022: 22.8%). Four and a half percentage points of the margin decline was due to the operating gearing effect of continued weak volumes in Consumer Care, compounded by lower volumes in Life Sciences and Industrial Specialties which share the same manufacturing assets, with overheads therefore allocated across all sectors. Two percentage points of the margin decline was due to weaker mix, primarily as a result of strong growth of lower margin F&F sales, with the lower variable remuneration charge and earn out accrual release providing a two percentage point offset.\n\nIn Consumer Care, our leadership in sustainability and innovation continues to drive customer demand for Croda's differentiated ingredient portfolio. NPP improved to 42% of total sales (2022: 41%) and sales of sustainable ingredients such as ECO surfactants and biotech-derived ingredients were stronger than other ingredients in our portfolio. To support demand for lower carbon ingredients, we can now provide carbon footprint data for three quarters of the Beauty Care portfolio so that customers can quantify the benefits associated with using our ingredients in their products. Sales to Asia exceeded sales to North America for the first time with significant potential for further growth. We are prioritising the region for investment in R&D and manufacturing, particularly in China and India where underlying sales grew 12%.\n\nThe stand-out performer in 2023 was F&F which delivered 18% underlying sales growth, benefitting from its distinctive positioning in fast-growing markets and agile, cost competitive model. F&F sales were up in all product categories and established regions, with the Middle East particularly strong. F&F's excellent sales growth principally reflects its high exposure to local and regional customers outside North America and Europe, as well as sales synergies that are being realised under Croda's ownership.\n\nIn Beauty Actives, reported sales were up 4% or down 1% on an underlying basis (i.e. excluding the Solus Biotech acquisition). Positive mix helped offset weaker volumes as sales of Sederma active ingredients grew, particularly in China, whereas sales of lower value botanical ingredients fell. Beauty Actives supported customer product launches including the new Boots No7 Future Renew range and a new Deciem product that repairs scars caused by acne. Having completed our acquisition of Solus Biotech in July, we are excited about the opportunities that the addition of further fermentation-derived active ingredients, notably ceramides, are starting to open up.\n\nPerformance remained weakest in Beauty Care with sales down 11% driven by lower volumes. Our approach here is to manage sales volumes in the less differentiated parts of the portfolio to help base-load our manufacturing assets and cover fixed costs, while accelerating differentiation by driving innovation, enhancing the sustainability profile of our ingredients, and transitioning our manufacturing processes to biotech and other low carbon technologies. The 20% plus growth in sales of ECO surfactants during a challenging year, and a continued increase in sales of sulphate-free 'clean' surfactants, illustrate continued customer demand for bio-based, lower carbon and biodegradable ingredients.\n\nThe recovery of sales volumes in Home Care accelerated as the year progressed, with underlying sales down 1% year-on-year but up 12% in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Once again it was sales of innovative ingredients differentiated by sustainability that led the way, including our range of biopolymers which extend the life of fabrics with future growth underpinned by a long-term contract with a key customer.",

        "page_content": "## Life Sciences - continued progress building industryleading positions in high-growth markets\n\nLife Sciences sales were down 12% to \u00a3602.3m (2022: \u00a3682.3m), with approximately seven percentage points of the reduction due to lower sales of lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. On a reported basis, positive price/mix of 3% partly offset a 15% decline in volume, the majority of which was due to destocking by Crop Protection customers with a small effect from similar trends in consumer health. There was also a contribution from six months of phospholipid sales following completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July and a small foreign currency headwind.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3131.7m (2022: \u00a3220.3m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a3150.3m (2022: \u00a3229.4m), resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 25.0% (2022: 33.6%). Six percentage points of the margin reduction was the result of adverse price/mix mainly due to lower Covid lipid sales, and four percentage points was the result of the negative operating leverage effect of lower volumes, mainly in Crop Protection, partly offset by the benefit from a negligible variable remuneration charge.\n\nCrop Protection is developing sustainable crop care solutions as well as delivery systems for biopesticides, launching two new delivery systems, one specially designed for biologicals and the second for drone delivery. Following an exceptional 2022, when Crop Protection delivered both strong double-digit percentage volume growth and price/mix, the business started the year with good momentum, but began to experience rapid customer destocking in the second quarter. Volume weakness continued throughout the second half year, to fall 21% year-on-year with a small offset from positive price/mix, resulting in sales falling 19% overall. In Seed Enhancement, most sales are derived from providing just-in-time enhancement services for vegetable seeds so the business only saw a limited impact from destocking, delivering 9% sales growth driven by strong structural growth trends. Seed Enhancement is winning market share through its leadership in microplastic-free seed coatings which are in high demand following the EU's decision to ban the use of microplastics in agriculture in the next five years.\n\nPharma continued to make good progress with its industry-leading position in biologics drug delivery as well as recent partnerships and new product launches further strengthening the pipeline of opportunities. Pharma sales fell 11% but grew 3% excluding lipid sales for Covid-19 vaccine applications. Whilst we were not immune from the challenges impacting the market, including customers reducing inventory levels, Covid normalisation and funding constraints for early-stage biotech companies, the breadth and diversification of our pharma portfolio enabled the business to deliver a resilient performance. Destocking primarily affected the heritage consumer health business where customer products are often sold over the counter, with lower Covid-19 demand adversely impacting Adjuvant Systems sales as well as lipids for Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. By contrast, drug delivery technologies for Small Molecule, Protein and Nucleic Acid applications continued to grow.\n\nTo drive the growth of Protein/Small Molecule Delivery we opened an applications centre in 'Genome Valley', Hyderabad, India, and launched our first processing aid for biopharma (technologies which are integral to the production of therapeutic proteins) which secured its first sales within three months of launch. The future growth of Adjuvant Systems will benefit from the launch of a new proprietary lipid-based adjuvant and two new adjuvant partnerships agreed with Amyris and BSI. One of these is for a sustainable squalene adjuvant that is produced by fermentation, which is already being qualified by three major vaccine companies. In Nucleic Acid Delivery, shipments of c.$60m of lipid systems to our principal Covid vaccine customers occurred as planned at the end of the fourth quarter, benefitting sector operating profit margin. Continued growth will be driven by the commercialisation of new nucleic acid drugs with the number in development continuing to expand, and Croda supporting most of those that specify a lipid delivery system. The strong medium-term growth trajectory for Nucleic Acid Delivery is likely to be realised in three phases: firstly, mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases,\n\nwhere we are working closely with the Big Pharma companies driving this development; secondly, oncology applications which require more targeted delivery systems; and thirdly, gene editing therapies such as a CRISPR treatment for sickle cell anaemia which we are supporting and was recently approved by the US FDA.\n\n## Industrial Specialties - contributing to the efficiency of our manufacturing assets\n\nFollowing the PTIC divestment, the retained business became Industrial Specialties (IS), operating a supply contract to the new owner of the divested business and contributing to the efficiency of our shared manufacturing site model by helping to optimise utilisation rates. On a pro forma basis, sales fell 35% to \u00a3206.1m principally due to lower volumes, reflecting destocking and weak industrial demand globally, and limiting the ability of IS to help optimise site utilisation. Pro forma adjusted operating profit fell 78% to \u00a39.4m as negative operating leverage compounded the impact of lower volumes. The impact of these adverse market conditions on the SIPO joint venture in China resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a320.8m taken at the 30 June 2023 balance sheet date. Including the impairment charge, the reported IFRS operating loss was \u00a312.0m (2022: \u00a379.9m profit), with the prior period including the full contribution from the divested business.\n\n## Continued balance sheet strength\n\nOur focus on active cash flow management in 2023 delivered excellent results with improved free cash flow reflecting a \u00a329.1m working capital inflow (2022: \u00a3133.8m outflow) more than offsetting lower profit and higher capex. In particular, we focused on managing down our own inventories, with stock days falling by approximately 20% during 2023. We expect our finished goods inventories to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the first quarter of 2024, mitigating the risk that selling from stock (manufactured from higher cost raw materials) has a detrimental impact on profit margins.\n\nWith improved free cash flow of \u00a3165.5m (2022 restated: \u00a3157.4m), our balance sheet remains strong and we closed the year with net debt of \u00a3537.6m (2022: \u00a3295.2m), including the \u00a3227.4m consideration paid on completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023. The resulting debt leverage ratio was 1.3x (2022: 0.5x), within our one to two times target range, despite the lower EBITDA.\n\nGiven the challenging market conditions, we reviewed the pace of in-flight capital expenditure projects, as well as all new proposals for non-safetycritical projects, whilst continuing to invest in our refocused portfolio to drive profitable growth. This resulted in some capital expenditure originally planned for 2024 being delayed until 2025. Organic capital expenditure in 2023 was broadly as expected at \u00a3170.1m (2022: \u00a3138.5m), focused on growing our R&D capability, in Asia especially, and expanding our manufacturing footprint to increase capacity.\n\nWith our strong balance sheet, we have been able to continue to invest despite the weaker macroeconomic environment. R&D investment included a new Consumer Care laboratory in Shanghai, China and a new applications centre in Hyderabad, India to support growing demand for protein and small molecule delivery from pharma customers. With our Pharma business a top priority for capital allocation, we also opened an adjuvant systems lab in Denmark and are due to expand our R&D capabilities for nucleic acid delivery at Alabaster in the USA and in Singapore in 2024.\n\nAlongside investments that help deliver the carbon reduction roadmaps that we have put in place for all Croda sites, we have also invested in capacity expansion focused on Asia, including starting construction of a new surfactants plant in Dahej, India, and the first stage of a \u00a330m investment in a combined Beauty Actives and F&F manufacturing facility in Guangzhou to grow domestic sales in China. In addition to our typical capital investment of around 6-8% of sales, we are investing an extra \u00a3175m over the period 2021 to 2024 to scale up Pharma production, particularly to meet forecast market demand for new nucleic acid drugs which are widely expected to come to the market from 2025, with the US and UK Governments co-investing up to an additional \u00a375m combined. We have invested over \u00a3110m in the programme to date. As a result of",

        "page_content": "'We complement organic investment with selective acquisitions of adjacent technologies, particularly those which can accelerate our transition to greater use of natural raw materials or build new technology platforms, enhancing future growth.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe review of phasing of current capital projects, total capital expenditure is expected to fall slightly in 2024, but with heightened levels of capex (compared to the pre-2021 period) continuing through 2025 as the Pharma facilities are built and capacity in Asia comes on-stream.\n\nWe complement organic investment with selective acquisitions of adjacent technologies, particularly those which can accelerate our transition to greater use of natural raw materials or build new technology platforms, enhancing future growth. The acquisition of Solus Biotech from Solus Advanced Materials has excellent alignment with our strategic priorities, expanding our Asian manufacturing capability, adding a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region, and providing our Beauty Actives and Pharma businesses with access to Solus' existing biotech-derived ceramide and phospholipid technologies, and its emerging capabilities in natural retinol. We will drive sales growth by leveraging Croda's global selling network and formulation science expertise.\n\nCapital deployment will be executed within our consistent capital allocation policy, set out in the Finance review. Alongside organic and inorganic investment, the policy provides for a regular and increasing ordinary dividend to shareholders, while operating an appropriate balance sheet. With 32 years of unbroken dividend progression, consistent distribution to shareholders is a critical consideration for the Board. Therefore, despite temporarily taking us outside our stated through-the-cycle payout ratio of distributing 40-50% of earnings, we have proposed a small increase in the full year dividend at 109p a share (2022: 108p). The Board is keeping the Company's future capital requirements under close review.\n\n## Strategy overview - megatrends intact; continued strategic investment through the downturn; well positioned for market recovery\n\n## Strategy overview\n\nDespite the challenging market conditions in 2023, the technology trends that will drive our future growth have not changed with continued demand for sustainable ingredients and a continued transition from small molecule active ingredients to large molecule biologics. Through the acquisitions and divestments we have made in recent years, we have successfully realigned our portfolio with these megatrends and our strategy of combining sustainability leadership with market-leading innovation is unchanged.\n\nIn line with our Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM , we enable customers to realise their sustainability ambitions through the application of our innovation and the creation of sustainable ingredients. We are reinforcing our sustainability leadership by reducing the adverse impact of our operations, by replacing fossil-based ingredients with bio-based materials, reducing emissions, promoting biodiversity and ensuring our sourcing activities make a positive contribution to communities in our supply chains. Our sustainability leadership delivers benefits that are increasingly valued by our customers; for example, we can now provide cradle-to-gate product-level carbon footprint data for approximately 1,300 of our ingredients so that customers can quantify the\n\nbenefits associated with using them in their products. We are continuing to expand this data set to cover more of our ingredient portfolio and a broader range of sustainability factors.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of what we do, creating new market and technology niches. We filed more than 100 new patents in 2023 and have stepped up our rate of innovation through more external partnerships, for example with Amyris and BSI for sustainable vaccine adjuvants. Even in the unprecedented market conditions that we have seen this year, customers are continuing to invest in new product development, drawing on Croda's deep scientific expertise and application-focused innovation. The foundation of our innovation model is internal R&D investment, applying the expertise of our scientists at our global innovation centres to meet customer needs. Our R&D teams now report directly into Consumer Care and Life Sciences, ensuring that our priorities are customer driven. This is complemented by 'big bet' projects often delivered with partners from our open innovation network which provides access to universities and SMEs, helping develop new intellectual property.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nWe are implementing specific strategic priorities to ensure our refocused portfolio delivers consistent top and bottom-line growth. Alongside our sector strategies we are (1) scaling biotech, (2) exploring acquisition opportunities to supplement organic capital deployment, (3) investing in fast growth in Asia, and (4) improving our customer and employee experience through our 'doing the basics brilliantly' programme.\n\n'Scaling biotech' will transform our approach to sustainability, particularly in reducing customers' scope 3 carbon emissions. Projects are underway to develop bio-based fragrance ingredients, prioritising aroma chemicals which are used in a high proportion of our fragrance references. Our Beauty Care business is adding biotech-derived surfactants to our existing ECO range, and Beauty Actives is launching novel anti-ageing actives developed through collaboration between our biotech and high throughput screening centres in the UK, France and Canada. This is one example of how Croda is reinforcing its leadership in biotechnology, established over more than a decade in plant cell cultures and fermentation, and now being enhanced by investment in processing for scale up, biocatalysis and synthetic biology.\n\nWe are supplementing our organic investment with 'acquisitions', where our global scouting network identifies potential adjacent technology opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences with the acquisition of Solus Biotech in South Korea completed in the year.\n\nThere are significant emerging opportunities for Croda across Asia particularly in consumer care and pharmaceutical markets. We are driving 'fast growth in Asia', by investing in innovation and sales resource plus selective expansion in manufacturing.\n\nOur 'doing the basics brilliantly' programme is simplifying our operating processes to improve employee productivity and driving efficiencies within our well-established customer-centric model including a new online ordering portal complemented by more self-serve data for customers. The programme is delivering good results including a 6% improvement for 'ease of doing business' alongside a further increase in overall net promoter score in our latest customer survey.\n\n## Sector strategies\n\nOur sector strategies are to 'strengthen to grow' Consumer Care and 'expand to grow' Life Sciences. We are 'strengthening to grow' Consumer Care to be the most innovative, sustainable and responsive solution provider globally. Even in the current trading environment, demand for innovation remains strong and we are continuing to enhance our portfolio by adding more fermentation-derived ingredients and high-performance replacements for fossil-based products. Similarly, we are broadening our unrivalled ability to substantiate ingredient claims to include product-level carbon footprint data, incorporating the impact of",

        "page_content": "decarbonisation to 2030. Finally, the continued fragmentation of consumer markets plays to our strengths as we partner with customers large and small globally, enabling smaller customers to partner with us to launch their products quickly.\n\nThe move to biologics is the key structural driver of growth in both pharmaceutical and agriculture markets over the next decade, and we are 'expanding to grow' Life Sciences to empower biologics delivery. In agriculture, this move will enable greater targeting of actives and reduced biodiversity impact. In this market we are positioned as an innovation partner for delivery systems, creating new systems specifically for the delivery of biopesticides and meeting the sustainability challenges of conventional pesticide delivery. In pharma markets, the move from chemical to biological active pharmaceutical ingredients is already underway and we have developed a portfolio focused on segments with the highest development and innovation needs. As a result, our pharma portfolio has a well-diversified risk profile and opportunity set, which we are expanding through new technologies from our own innovation pipeline and via partnerships. The competitive positioning of our Pharma business is extremely strong, providing delivery systems that are critical to next-generation drugs and with excellent customer relationships spanning drug discovery through to commercial supply.\n\n## Future performance drivers\n\nIn Consumer Care, average customer inventory levels have fallen and volume recovery should be an important driver of near-term performance, particularly in Beauty Care which has broad market exposure and is larger than the other business units. Our approach in Beauty Care is to manage sales volumes in those parts of the portfolio where there is less differentiation to underpin consistent plant utilisation while also accelerating portfolio differentiation through innovation, sustainability and biotech. More recent additions to Consumer Care, including ceramides in Beauty Actives - which have significant growth potential, and the F&F business - which is delivering impressive sales growth albeit at margins which are below the average for Consumer Care, can also influence our future performance. Geographically, Asian consumer care markets are likely to grow faster than the rest of the world, particularly in India and China. While our direct sales to China have remained robust, a broadbased recovery in Chinese consumer spending and travel would underpin improved global demand for consumer care products.\n\nIn Life Sciences, an end to destocking in Crop Protection markets would be an important driver of improved performance in the near term. However, the timing of this inflection point is uncertain as destocking started later, and customer concentration is higher, so demand can be determined by the buying decisions of four or five major customers. In addition, agriculture markets are seasonal, so a lack of demand can mean that a whole season is missed, but conversely when a recovery comes it is likely to have a more immediate effect. Historically, the market for field crop seeds experiences changes in demand later in the cycle, so the market environment could be tougher in 2024, but for Croda, this risk is mitigated by our focus on vegetable seeds as well as market leadership in microplastic-free seed coatings and the incremental opportunities that are being created by regulation change.\n\nThe challenges that faced pharmaceutical markets in 2023, including the reset of demand post Covid-19, destocking and contraction in the availability of early-stage funding, appear to be temporary rather than structural, but their effects could continue into 2024. Over the longer term, accelerating growth and margins will be driven by incremental revenue from our own innovation pipeline and the commercialisation of new biologic drugs. The drivers of future performance in Pharma are therefore the rate of growth of our new delivery systems and vaccine adjuvants that we are bringing to the market, many of which are already generating revenue and have meaningful peak sales projections, and the pace of approval of new mRNA drugs and vaccines, a high proportion of which we are supporting during clinical trials and have invested capital in to be able to produce at scale when launched.\n\n## Outlook\n\nConsumer Care has started the year well and we are cautiously optimistic about the improving demand trend we experienced in January. Within Life Sciences, we expect the non-Covid Pharma business to grow but that destocking will continue in Crop Protection. Demand in Industrial Specialties is expected to remain weak.\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty in our end markets, the recovery trajectory for each of our business units remains difficult to predict and the range of possible outcomes in 2024 is therefore wider than usual at this stage of the year. Overall, however, the Group expects to deliver mid to high single digit percentage sales growth in 2024, excluding the c.$60m of Covid-19 lipid sales in 2023, with higher sales volumes more than offsetting lower price/mix.\n\nWe expect 2024 Group adjusted operating margin to be two to three percentage points lower than 2023 due to the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Different business mix effects year-on-year, with no Covid-19 lipid contribution and continued strong growth in Fragrances and Flavours.\n- \u00b7  Low overhead recovery is expected to persist as sales volumes remain depressed in Crop Protection and Industrial Specialties, two of the three businesses with the highest production volumes, alongside Beauty Care.\n- \u00b7  To support the return to sales growth, the cost base will reset back to a more normalised level from its low point in 2023. This will include the likely unwind in 2024 of the c.\u00a325m benefit we saw in 2023 from a negligible variable remuneration charge.

With most suitable land already farmed, increased output will come from higher yields and growing more resilient crops on less suitable land, supported by restoring degraded ecosystems and nature.\n\nPopulation growth and increasing consumption, fuelled by the expansion of the middle class particularly in developing countries, are putting pressure on planetary systems such as water, climate and biodiversity, and scarce natural resources. Addressing this challenge requires transformational new approaches to consumption and circularity.\n\nThe pandemic has made consumers more conscious of their physical and mental wellbeing, and expanded demands on healthcare systems, already increasing due to a growing and ageing population. This has increased demand for effective ingredients that are underpinned by science and support physical and mental health.\n\n## Move to sustainable ingredients\n\nWith population growth and increasing consumption putting pressure on planetary systems, consumers are supporting companies they think are acting responsibly and providing solutions to the causes and impacts of climate change. This is influencing consumer decisions when it comes to the products that they buy.\n\nAs a result, consumer-facing companies are looking for ingredients that enable them to deliver products with substantiated claims and transparent information about their social and environmental impacts.\n\nThe move to sustainable ingredients is not confined to the consumer market, with crop science companies seeking biodegradable ingredients with a low carbon footprint, that can make a positive contribution to improving yields, soil health and biodiversity.\n\nGrowing demand for sustainable ingredients is also driving increased regulation by industry and national authorities.\n\n- 1.  Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Global agriculture towards 2050.\n\n## Move to biologics\n\nThe move to biologics - large molecules manufactured using microorganisms rather than small molecules made by chemical synthesis is transforming medicine and agriculture.\n\nBiologic drugs are much better at treating disease in a targeted way with fewer side effects, but they are hard to make, difficult to stabilise, and need sophisticated delivery systems. Nucleic acid drugs that teach the body to make its own medicine represent the next phase in the move to biologics, further enhancing patient outcomes and increasing drug complexity.\n\nBiologically active technologies, including naturally occurring microbes and RNA interference, are also being used as precisely targeted, environmentally friendly pesticides.\n\nThe ability for these biologics to target specific elements in the host offers significant opportunities to reduce negative impacts on the planet and society.\n\n## Global demand for health and wellbeing\n\n<!-- image -->",

As this monetary tightening took hold, customers began to reduce inventory levels, albeit at different times across the different market segments that we serve.\n\nOne impact of this change in the trading environment was that raw material costs fell during 2023 enabling us to reduce prices in market segments where price is important to competitiveness.\n\nHigher interest rates have also negatively impacted the availability of funding, particularly for early-stage companies which often drive the development of nascent technologies in sectors such as pharmaceuticals. To date, the impact of this funding squeeze on Croda's Pharma business has been limited, as the development of novel drugs that use our delivery systems, such as mRNA vaccines for respiratory diseases, are principally driven by 'Big Pharma'.\n\nWith inflation now falling and the US Federal Reserve indicating that the period of tightening monetary policy could be over, interest rates are likely to fall in 2024, supporting lower volatility in customer demand.\n\n## US, UK and EU central bank interest rates (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Interest rate forecasts are from Bloomberg as at 19 January 2024.\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n## Rapid and indiscriminate destocking\n\nThe chemical industry has experienced a prolonged period of destocking with an impact across all markets.\n\nIn 2021-22, customers carried higher levels of inventory to meet surging demand, avoid disruptions and as a hedge against inflation. With higher interest rates in 2023, customers have freed up capital held in excess stock.\n\nDestocking has been compounded by a weaker demand environment, particularly in China, where the economy has not recovered from Covid-19 as fast as some of our customers were anticipating.\n\nAs a result, order visibility has been shorter than normal, and sales volumes were down across most markets. This led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our 'shared' manufacturing assets (that produce ingredients for multiple business units) with negative operating leverage impacting profit margins.\n\nEncouragingly, customer demand for our ingredients that are differentiated by their sustainability characteristics has been resilient and demand for innovation has remained strong.\n\nIn 2023 customer inventories remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Consumer Care inventory levels reduced through the year as shown in the chart below, but in Crop Protection inventory levels remained significantly elevated. Looking into 2024, whilst geopolitical risks remain heightened, customer inventory levels should continue to fall.\n\n## Inventory days for large customers Colgate Henkel Unilever J&J Beiersdorf Est\u00d8e Lauder\n\nPre-Covid\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n## Consumer Care customers\n\nCrop Protection customers 2022 Pre-Covid\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 2023 Pre-CV19 Source: Inventory days are derived from public company disclosures for the relevant customer.\n\nL'Or\u00d8al",

        "page_content": "## Focused on operational delivery\n\n## Driving Group efficiency\n\n'There are further opportunities to drive efficiency savings by simplifying our business processes and driving improvements to the way we work that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational effectiveness over the longer term.'\n\n## Louisa Burdett\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nGiven the challenging trading conditions in 2023, we took some immediate actions to address costs, at the same time as driving incremental sales growth by increasing customer sales activity and using quieter time during 2023 to bring forward maintenance and focus on other capital projects. Prioritising customer-facing activities will help ensure we can take advantage of the demand recovery when it occurs.\n\nTight cost control measures were implemented from the second quarter of 2023 to maximise profitability. A refreshed operational dashboard was also introduced to provide up-to-date performance data to leaders. As we saw volumes reset downwards, we optimised production to match the lower demand through plant shutdowns, reduced shift patterns, and introducing more 'make to order' contracts with customers. This helped us avoid costs, with energy and freight costs falling through the year and second half costs 12% lower than the first half. Outside of production, our main focus was on budgeted cost avoidance such as restricting travel, curtailing headcount and other common-sense measures.\n\nAnnual salary increases were granted at the start of 2023 but a hiring freeze from Q2 onwards meant underlying employee headcount fell. In addition, a negligible charge for variable remuneration versus 2022 benefitted operating profit margin. A new organisational structure has been in place since the start of 2024, with all regional teams now reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This will ensure we deliver more effectively for our customers and should result in annual cost savings of \u00a39m from 2025. A \u00a35.4m exceptional restructuring\n\ncharge was recognised in the 2023 accounts associated with the introduction of this simpler operating model and we expect a charge of low single-digit millions in 2024 as further benefits are realised. In addition, we regularly review our site footprint and closed a site at Cikarang in Indonesia which principally served industrial customers.\n\nThere are further opportunities to drive efficiency savings by simplifying our business processes and driving improvements to the way we work that will deliver sustained benefits to our operational effectiveness over the longer term. A number of workstreams are already underway under our 'doing the basics brilliantly' programme, including through the use of artificial intelligence, data analytics, an online ordering tool that is saving hundreds of employee hours, and a multi-year SAP upgrade.\n\nWe have actively managed our cash flow encouraging all employees to focus on generating cash, managing down our own inventories and collecting payments promptly. This delivered excellent results with improved free cash flow due to a working capital inflow and a significant reduction in inventory days which fell by around 20%. We expect our finished goods inventories to be back to pre-pandemic levels from a high point at the end of 2022 by the end of the first quarter of 2024, mitigating the risk that selling from stock (manufactured from higher cost raw materials) has a detrimental impact on profit margins. Enhanced by this improved free cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong with our debt leverage ratio within our target range of one to two times.\n\nDuring the year we reviewed the pace of all in-flight capital expenditure projects, as well as every new proposal for non-safety-critical projects. This ensured that we maintained strong capital discipline whilst continuing to invest through the downturn in our refocused portfolio to drive profitable growth.\n\nIn addition to continued organic capital expenditure to support significant opportunities for growth across Consumer Care and Life Sciences, on 4 July 2023, we completed the acquisition of Solus Biotech from Solus Advanced Materials for a total consideration of \u00a3227.4m, funded from cash and debt facilities. This brings biotechnology-derived ingredients into our portfolio including ceramides and phospholipids.\n\nWith a track record of more than 30 years unbroken dividend progression, consistent distribution to shareholders is a key consideration for the Board. We have proposed a small increase in the full year dividend at 109p a share (2022: 108p).\n\n## A balanced approach to capital allocation\n\nOur continued capital deployment was executed within our consistent capital allocation policy which is to:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nReinvest for growth - invest in organic capital expenditure to drive shareholder value creation through new capacity, product innovation and expansion in attractive geographic markets to drive sales and profit growth;\n\nAcquire disruptive technologies - to supplement organic growth, we are targeting a number of exciting technology acquisitions in existing and adjacent markets, with a focus on strengthening Consumer Care and expanding in Life Sciences with a particular emphasis on Pharma technologies; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProvide regular returns to shareholders - pay a regular dividend to shareholders, representing 40 to 50% of adjusted earnings over the business cycle;\n\nMaintain an appropriate balance sheet - to meet future investment and trading requirements, targeting a leverage ratio of 1 to 2x over the medium-term cycle. We consider returning excess capital to shareholders when leverage falls below our target range and sufficient capital is available to meet our investment opportunities.

While our 2023 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are tracking well below our Science Based Target, the challenging business environment and associated reduction in sales volumes in 2023 contributed to the lower emissions output. Although volumes are expected to recover, we remain confident in achieving our Science Based Target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 9-13 of our Sustainability Impact Report\n\nSee pages 14-18 of our Sustainability Impact Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress on our Commitments in 2023\n\n## Climate Positive\n\nAs we continue to deliver on our Science Based Target (SBT) for GHG emissions reduction, we recognise the value to our customers of sharing product-level carbon footprint (PCF) data, to help their decision-making as they formulate. In 2023 we launched PCF data to our Consumer Care customers, covering scope 1, 2 and upstream scope 3 emissions with a methodology aligned to industry standards. The majority of our carbon footprint is emissions associated with the production of our raw materials. We are therefore fully engaged with suppliers, both directly and as members of the chemical industry consortium, Together for Sustainability (TfS), to gain greater clarity on emissions and started to receive primary scope 3 data from leading players in 2023. We also completed our first downstream scope 3 inventory analysis, which demonstrated the importance of understanding indirect consumer emissions throughout the full lifecycle of a product.\n\n## Land Positive\n\nIn addition to our land saved target we aim to bring an average of two crop technological breakthroughs to market each year until 2030. In 2023, we launched four products which protect biodiversity and mitigate the impact of changing climate and land degradation, bringing our total launched since 2020 to nine. Our use of raw materials derived from bio-based and other natural sources brings with it a responsibility to understand and address our dependencies on ecosystems and impacts on nature and biodiversity. In 2023 we were selected to join World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Science Based Target for Nature Preparer Group, in line with our ambition to contribute to a Nature Positive world by 2030. In response to the first release of SBTs for Nature, which aim to refine understanding of our impacts on freshwater, as well as protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, this small group of WBCSD members is working to help organisations develop their goals for nature.\n\n## Definition\n\nLand area saved through the application of our crop protection and seed enhancement technologies, using 2019 as our baseline year.\n\n## Target\n\nThroughout this decade, the land saved through the application of our technologies will exceed any increase in land used to grow our raw materials by at least a factor of two, and by 2030 we will save a minimum of 200,000 hectares per year more than in 2019.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2023, the use of our agricultural ingredients and new technologies saved 58,815 hectares of land versus our 2019 baseline of 92,223 hectares, translating to a total land saving of 151,038 hectares in 2023. We remain on track to hit our 2024 intermediate milestone of saving at least 80,000 hectares per year more than in 2019, and our 2030 target of saving 200,000 hectares per year more than in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023 we progressed towards our target of contributing to the successful development and commercialisation of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines and have already achieved our 2024 milestone of 10 clinical phase III trials, two years ahead of schedule. We are continuing to work towards gender balance in our management. In 2023, we increased the number of women in senior positions to 39% \u2206 (2022: 38%). The Croda Foundation was established in 2021 to help sustainably improve one million lives.

Measuring the proportion of NPP sales relative to total sales at constant currency is our established KPI for innovation. Over time we are transitioning to measuring absolute growth in NPP sales. This transition simplifies our NPP metric but more importantly recognises the importance of our non-NPP sales, particularly sales of those products that do not meet our rigid NPP criteria but have superior sustainability profiles and are delivering strong growth on that basis.\n\n## Delivering innovation in 2023\n\nOur innovation capability comprises not just our own self-funded R&D programmes but also a growing network of innovation partners, including SMEs and academia. These innovation partners often have expertise in specialist fields such as biotechnology or pharma, and expand our innovation capacity to help accelerate key projects. We continued to grow our open innovation network in 2023 and by the end of the year had collaborated with more than 580 innovation partners on around 300 innovation projects since adopting this open innovation model.\n\nInnovation efforts are focused on bringing differentiated solutions to customers and doing so in a way that has a positive downstream impact and can help customers achieve their sustainability ambitions, while ensuring we deliver progress against our own 2030 sustainability targets. We are focused on key platform technologies such as synthetic biology, biocatalysis and downstream processing and are also investing to scale biotechnology and expand sustainable chemistry.\n\nDeveloping sustainable alternatives to existing ingredients remains a key focus of our innovation efforts and in 2023 new projects included a partnership aimed at developing bio-based and biodegradable polymers for liquid polymer solutions, which are often used in personal care and crop care applications for rheology modification. Another project is focused on using biotechnology to generate sustainable terpenes, key ingredients in flavours and fragrances which are typically produced by chemical synthesis of petrochemical-derived raw materials.\n\n## Target\n\nWe seek to drive NPP sales growth at least as fast as total sales over the cycle, targeted at mid to high single-digit percentage growth.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe proportion of sales of NPP has grown over the long term from 20.5% in 2012 to reach 33.5% in 2023. The small reduction in NPP sales as a proportion of total sales in 2023 reflects a reduction in the sales of Covid-19 lipids. In the year, Group NPP sales fell by 4%, excluding the impact of Covid-19 lipid sales and the PTIC divestment, a less significant fall than for Group sales as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Open innovation partners and initiated projects\n\n<!-- image -->",

In an era defined by rapid global economic shifts and evolving consumer desires, our strategy positions us at the forefront of the market, ready to meet the demands of an increasingly discerning consumer base. Consumers will pay a premium for high-quality, innovative formulations and substantiated product claims. They also want to live their lives more sustainably and this is impacting their decisions when it comes to the products to buy.\n\nOur ambition is to be the world's most sustainable, innovative and responsive solution provider. Already recognised as a market-leading innovator, our strategy is to continue to strengthen Consumer Care in fast growth niches, by accelerating innovation, expanding our sustainable product portfolio and enhancing our customer intimacy. Leadership requires us to deliver sustainable ingredients with the best performance and data to support customer claims.

        "page_content": "## Consumer Care continued\n\n## Consumer Care\n\n## Performance summary - leadership in innovation and sustainability driving demand\n\nConsumer Care sales fell 1% to \u00a3886.1m (2022: \u00a3897.8m) with strong double-digit percentage sales growth in F&F but lower underlying sales in Beauty Actives, Beauty Care and Home Care. Price/mix was 2% mainly due to a positive mix impact from Beauty Actives, with pricing broadly flat. Sales volumes were down 4% year-on-year but were up 9% in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Acquisitions added 1% due to sales of ceramides following the Solus Biotech acquisition, with foreign currency translation a small headwind particularly in the second half year.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3127.8m (2022: \u00a3144.5m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a3160.3m (2022: \u00a3204.7m), resulting in adjusted operating margin reducing to 18.1% (2022: 22.8%). Four and a half percentage points of the margin decline was due to the operating gearing effect of continued weak volumes in Consumer Care, compounded by lower volumes in Life Sciences and Industrial Specialties which share the same manufacturing assets. Two percentage points of the margin decline was due to weaker mix as a result of strong growth of lower margin F&F sales, with the negligible variable remuneration charge and provision release associated with an earn-out on the Iberchem acquisition providing a partial offset.\n\nIn Consumer Care, our leadership in sustainability and innovation continues to drive demand for Croda's differentiated ingredient portfolio. Sales of New and Protected Products (NPP) improved to 42% of total sales (2022: 41%) and sales of sustainable ingredients such as ECO surfactants and biotech-derived ingredients were stronger than other ingredients in our portfolio. We can now provide product-level carbon footprint data to our customers so that they can quantify the benefits associated with using around 1,300 of our ingredients in their products, supporting a structural shift in behaviour by customers and consumers towards sustainable ingredients. The focus of our work has been on Beauty Care where Product Carbon Footprints are now available for three quarters of our portfolio.\n\nSales to Asia exceeded sales to North America for the first time with significant potential for further growth, particularly for premium products driven by the increasing number of middle-class consumers. To maximise fast growth in Asia, we have prioritised investment in R&D, sales and production in China and India in particular where underlying sales grew 12% in 2023. While our performance in China has remained robust, owing to strong relationships with regional brands built on our innovation expertise, a broad-based recovery in Chinese consumer spending and travel would underpin improved global demand for consumer care products.\n\nThe stand-out performer in 2023 was Fragrances and Flavours (F&F) which delivered 18% underlying sales growth, benefitting from its distinctive positioning in fast-growing markets and agile, cost competitive model. F&F sales were up in all product categories and established regions, with the Middle East particularly strong. This excellent sales growth principally reflects F&F's high exposure to local and regional customers outside North America and Europe as well as sales synergies that are being realised under Croda's ownership. These include a new multi-million pound a year sales opportunity to supply fragrances to a multinational company in regions where F&F has local production. Projects are also underway to further increase the proportion of bio-based fragrance ingredients, to continue the move towards lower carbon and a more natural footprint. Approved R&D and manufacturing investment programmes are underway in China, Indonesia, France and Spain to continue the growth momentum.\n\nIn Beauty Actives , reported sales were up 4% but down 1% on an underlying basis (i.e. excluding the Solus Biotech acquisition). Positive mix helped offset weaker volumes as Sederma active ingredients grew, particularly in China, whereas sales of lower-value botanicals fell. The business supported new customer products with peptides for the new Boots No7 Future Renew range and for a new Deciem product that repairs scars caused by acne. Our ingredients are increasingly derived from biotechnology, both plant stem cells and fermentation, and we recently launched LuceaneTM, an anti-ageing active with its origins in marine biotechnology, and an active ingredient that fades age spots caused by the sun. Having completed the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023, we are excited about the opportunities that the addition of further fermentation-derived active ingredients to our portfolio are starting to open up, with strong customer demand already evident for ceramides. We will drive rapid sales growth of Solus ingredients by leveraging Croda's global selling network and formulation science expertise.\n\nPerformance remained weakest in Beauty Care , which has broad market exposure and is larger than the other business units, with sales down 11% driven by lower volumes. Our approach in Beauty Care is to manage sales volumes in the less differentiated parts of the portfolio to underpin consistent plant utilisation and cover fixed costs. We are also working to win back business in North America which we lost in 2022 through our inability to supply. In parallel, we are accelerating the differentiation of the Beauty Care portfolio by driving innovation, enhancing the sustainability profile of our ingredients, and transitioning our manufacturing processes to biotech and other low carbon technologies. Already a sustainability leader, the business is adding further high-performance replacements for fossil-based products, such as biotech-derived surfactants to reinforce a number one position in sustainable surfactants. In hair care, our focus is on biodegradable hair care ingredients and non-animal alternatives for hair conditioning. In sun protection, we specialise in mineral sunscreens that deliver superior SPF protection, are 'reef safe' and appear clear on the skin. The continued fragmentation of beauty care markets plays to our strengths as we partner with customers large and small enabling them to launch their products quickly. We are leveraging this position as go-to-market partner at our innovation centres globally where we offer to co-create customer products.\n\nThe recovery of sales volumes in Home Care accelerated as the year progressed, with underlying sales down 1% year-on-year but up 12% in the second half compared with the second half of 2022. Once again it was sales of two technology platforms that are differentiated by sustainability that led the way - bio-based ECO surfactants for household care and biopolymers which extend the life of fabrics. We also agreed a long-term contract with a key customer that underpins future sales of our biopolymer range.\n\nAlongside investments that help deliver the carbon reduction roadmaps that we have put in place for all sites, Consumer Care investment is focused on Asia to support continued growth momentum. In China, we opened a new laboratory in Shanghai and started work on a \u00a330m combined Beauty Actives and F&F manufacturing facility in Guangzhou to grow domestic sales. In India, we commenced construction of a new surfactants plant at a greenfield site in Dahej. The acquisition of Solus Biotech in South Korea has also given us another state-of-the-art plant in the region and strengthened our presence across Asia.",

Ceramides help form a protective layer, reinforcing the skin's natural barrier and improving hydration while reducing free radicals and protecting against damage from pollution. Although ceramides are naturally found in the skin, their concentration depletes with age, and they are increasingly recognised as a 'miracle' ingredient with the number of new personal care products containing ceramides doubling over the last five years. The acquisition not only broadens our beauty actives offering to include ceramides, but also expands our biotechnology capabilities and brings a new site in South Korea which will act as a springboard into premium markets in Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enabling customers to make purchasing decisions aligned to their environmental goals\n\nIn October 2023, we launched product carbon footprint (PCF) statements for around 1,300 of our Beauty Care ingredients, representing about three quarters of the revenue for our Beauty Care portfolio. The statement is a cradle-togate life cycle assessment that provides our customers with the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the ingredient, from sourcing the raw materials through to when the final product leaves our factory gates.\n\nPCFs allow customers to make more informed purchasing decisions as they work towards their own decarbonisation plans. This means customers can assess the benefits of using Croda ingredients in terms of the GHG impact on their finished product.\n\nFor Croda, PCFs enable us to see our GHG emissions at a product level so we can understand where our product portfolio is successfully helping us meet our decarbonisation targets and opportunities to further reduce our impact. They will also help us prioritise the carbon claims of new ingredients as a source of competitive advantage.\n\nThe Croda proprietary tool automates the calculation of cradle-to-gate product carbon footprints and was created by a team comprising data scientists, mathematicians, and accountants as well as sustainability specialists.\n\n## Leveraging biotechnology to deliver advanced ingredients with improved sustainability profiles\n\nUtilising biotechnology, including plant cell cultures and the fermentation of microorganisms, to create innovative ingredients is not new to Croda and is something we have been doing in our Beauty Actives business for more than 30 years. By enabling us to exploit the cellular and biomolecular processes of living organisms outside of animals, biotechnology makes it possible to produce alternatives to ingredients which are currently manufactured with synthetic chemistry using solvents, catalysts and in some cases hazardous materials. The use of biotechnology therefore offers the potential to develop innovative active ingredients, using natural ingredients with sustainable supply chains, while improving certain processes to deliver time savings and higher yields.\n\nIn 2023, we launched Luceane TM , a patented active ingredient that counteracts hypoxia ageing by stimulating and protecting cell respiration and energy production, while also inducing micropollutant removal within cells. Studies have shown Luceane TM slows down the ageing process by five years after just one month of application, reducing signs of fatigue and improving skin radiance. Manufactured using the fermentation of marine microorganisms, Luceane TM is 100% natural, fully biodegradable, RSPO certified and uses sustainable manufacturing with complete waste recovery, demonstrating how our smart science can deliver advanced ingredients sustainably.",

Our innovation portfolio is designed to selectively support customers, large and small, who are driving emerging pharma technologies, and to unlock value from our technology strengths. Pharma comprises three technology platforms:\n\n## Protein/Small Molecule Delivery has an established\n\nrecord of providing delivery systems for complex protein drugs. These large, sensitive molecules are typically injected. Our differentiated range delivers the highest purity excipients to customers, including 'Big Pharma'. Our strategy is to support established small molecule drugs and develop excipients for complex protein and monoclonal antibody (mAb) applications, and expand our portfolio of high purity reagents for bioprocessing.\n\nAdjuvant Systems is the most advanced third-party supplier of adjuvants (immune response boosters) for vaccines. There is a large, recognised need for innovation in vaccine adjuvant systems as a result of the development of novel therapeutic vaccines that cure diseases previously only treatable with symptomatic treatments. Croda is well-positioned with the broadest range of vaccine adjuvant systems and is embedded within vaccine pipelines across many indications.\n\nOur strategy is to accelerate use of innovative adjuvant systems, comprising multiple building blocks, supporting WHO vaccine programmes and the development of future preventative and therapeutic vaccines.\n\nNucleic Acid Delivery was created after our 2020 acquisition of Avanti and enabled the world's first commercial lipid system for mRNA vaccines for Covid-19. Our innovation pipeline looks to improve lipid delivery systems and create new transfection agents for cell and gene therapy. We are included in a high proportion of the rich pipeline of nucleic acid drugs that are in development and due to commercialise from 2025.\n\nIn addition, our Avanti Research catalogue continues as a distinct strategic arm targeting early-stage R&D and academic relationships. This embeds our technologies in clinical development and, if successful, we position ourselves as the partner of choice for commercialisation.\n\n## (c.15% of sector sales)\n\nSeed Enhancement leverages our leadership in seed coating systems and enhancement technologies to improve germination, stimulate healthy development of seeds and increase crop yield.

        "page_content": "## Expanding Life Sciences\n\n## Market opportunities - Pharma\n\n## Pioneering the future of healthcare\n\nIn pharmaceutical markets, Croda focuses on providing systems that deliver Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) to the target site in the body, maintain stability and improve efficacy.\n\nWe are pioneering the future of healthcare by focusing on segments with a high development need. Our key differentiator is innovation, creating new ingredients from sustainable sources with a unique quality.\n\nFor protein delivery we provide a range of speciality excipients for challenging formulations including injectables. In adjuvant systems, we are the only independent supplier with a full component portfolio and the ability to put those vaccine adjuvants together to power the therapeutic vaccines of the future. We are the leading innovator of components for nucleic acid delivery, capable of both developing new systems and scaling them up to support commercial roll out.\n\nIn total we have over 5,000 customers across the whole pharmaceutical lifecycle. Our approach is to develop delivery systems for candidate drugs in early-stage research, generating revenue from providing materials during clinical development and then as the principal supplier of the delivery system if the drug is commercialised. Our broad base means we are exposed to a wide range of customers, drugs and applications.\n\n## Market opportunities - Agriculture\n\n## Innovating for global food security\n\nThe agriculture industry is at a pivotal moment, facing the dual imperatives of delivering higher yields to feed a growing population and reducing chemical use as required by tighter regulation. Through our deep understanding of plant science, we can contribute to increasing food production without the need to use more land, thereby helping to improve global food security.\n\nWe are helping address the challenges with conventional pesticides by developing low carbon, biodegradable delivery systems to enable sustainable formulations and promote soil health. Our drift reduction technologies target crop spraying and are a key enabler of new farming practices such as drone application. We are also first to market with microplastic-free seed coatings many years before regulatory change and are enhancing seeds so that they germinate in the more challenging conditions created by climate change.\n\nWhilst the market for biopesticides is much smaller than the market for conventional pesticides, it is growing much faster, presenting the opportunity for agriculture to have a much lower impact on biodiversity. We are creating solutions for a more sustainable future by developing delivery systems for biopesticides in which the active ingredients are microorganisms rather than chemicals and even nucleic acids that target a specific pest or inactivate a disease.\n\n## Life Sciences vision\n\n## To empower biologics delivery\n\n## Strategy to expand Life Sciences\n\n## Pharma\n\n- \u00b7  Focus on delivery systems with high development needs\n- \u00b7  Transition from ingredients supplier to systems provider\n\n## Agriculture\n\n- \u00b7  Reinforce leadership in sustainable delivery systems\n- \u00b7  Enable the transition to biopesticides\n\n## Invest in innovation pipeline, knowledge and capacity\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn Life Sciences, Croda focuses on providing delivery systems for active pharmaceutical and crop ingredients. Our technologies deliver the active, improve its efficacy and solve challenges of stability and sustainability in customer formulations.\n\nOur global footprint gives us presence in the major crop regions and access to leading pharma R&D. Our strength in North America and Western Europe is now leveraged through expansion in Asia and Latin America. Working as an innovation partner to the major crop science companies, we have also expanded with medium and smallersized customers, especially local customers in Latin America, India and China. Our acquisition of research-focused Avanti in 2020 expanded our pharma customer base to span drug discovery and clinical trial stages, alongside our established commercialisation business. These relationships extend beyond global brands to academia, start-ups and biotech, where significant breakthrough discovery happens.\n\nOur strategy is to expand Life Sciences to empower biologics delivery, enabling the move from small chemically synthesised molecules to large and complex biologics, a megatrend which is transforming the pharmaceutical market and which will transform agriculture. In Pharma, we focus on segments with the strongest growth and highest innovation needs, leveraging our delivery systems and technology platforms to create new solutions for customers. In our Agriculture business, we are reinforcing our leadership with sustainable solutions and leveraging our expertise to accelerate the transition to biopesticides, which will enable greater targeting of actives and reduced biodiversity impact.\n\nTo deliver this strategy, we are investing in innovation, knowledge and capacity. Our R&D investment is creating an extensive innovation pipeline. We are increasing our knowledge base in innovation, sales and manufacturing, co-investing with national governments who recognise the importance of biologics in the 21 st century. We are supplementing organic growth with acquisition of new technology platforms, building on the successful growth of our vaccine adjuvant platform, acquired in 2018 and already doubled in sales, and our lipid systems platform, acquired in 2020, the first to deliver a commercial Covid-19 mRNA delivery system and widely utilised within the fast-evolving gene editing market.",

        "page_content": "## Life Sciences continued\n\n## Life Sciences\n\n## Performance summary - continued progress building industry-leading positions in high-growth markets\n\nLife Sciences sales were down 12% to \u00a3602.3m (2022: \u00a3682.3m), with approximately seven percentage points of the reduction due to lower sales of lipid systems for Covid-19 vaccine applications. On a reported basis, positive price/mix of 3% partly offset a 15% decline in volume, the majority of which was due to destocking by Crop Protection customers with a small effect from similar trends in consumer health. There was also a contribution from phospholipid sales following completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023 and a small foreign currency headwind. Sales of New and Protected Products (NPP) as a percentage of total sector sales fell to 29% (2022: 42%) or by one percentage point to 31% (2022: 32%) excluding the impact from Covid-19 lipid sales.\n\nIFRS operating profit was \u00a3131.7m (2022: \u00a3220.3m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a3150.3m (2022: \u00a3229.4m), resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 25.0% (2022: 33.6%). Six percentage points of the margin reduction was the result of adverse price/mix mainly due to lower Covid lipid sales, and four percentage points was the result of the negative operating leverage effect of lower volumes mainly in Crop Protection, partly offset by the benefit from a negligible variable remuneration charge. Shipments of c.$60m of lipid systems to our principal Covid vaccine customers occurred as planned at the end of the year benefitting second half operating profit margin.\n\nCrop Protection is meeting the 'innovation gap' created by regulatory pressure to reduce pesticide use by developing sustainable crop care solutions as well as delivery systems for crop biologics that are enabling customers to transition to biopesticides. We recently launched our first delivery system specially designed for biopesticides, which has secured sales in all regions, and a new product that meets the growing demand for drone application particularly in Asia. Following an exceptional 2022, when Crop Protection delivered both strong double-digit percentage volume growth and price/mix, the business started the year with good momentum, but began to experience rapid customer destocking in the second quarter, with Q2 volumes down more than 30% compared with Q1. Volume weakness continued throughout the second half year, to fall 21% year-on-year with a small offset from positive price/mix, resulting in sales falling 19% overall. An end to destocking in Crop Protection markets would be an important driver of improved Life Sciences performance in the near term but the timing of this inflection point is uncertain as destocking started later than in other markets, and customer concentration is higher, so demand can be determined by the buying decisions of four or five major customers. In addition, agriculture markets are seasonal, so a lack of demand can mean that a whole season is missed, but conversely when a recovery comes it is likely to have a more immediate effect.\n\nIn Seed Enhancement , a significant proportion of sales are derived from providing just-in-time enhancement services for vegetable seeds. As such, the business only sees a limited impact from stocking cycles and delivered a 9% sales increase, driven by strong structural growth trends. Seed Enhancement is winning market share through its leadership in microplastic-free seed coatings which are in high demand globally following the European Union's recent adoption of measures that will ban the use of microplastics in agriculture in the next five years. Historically, the market for field crop seeds experiences changes in demand later in the cycle, so the market environment could be tougher in 2024, but for Croda, this risk is mitigated by our focus on vegetable seeds, our sustainability leadership and the incremental opportunities that are being created by regulation change.\n\nPharma continued to make good progress with its industry-leading position in biologics drug delivery as well as recent partnerships and new product launches further strengthening the pipeline of opportunities. Pharma sales fell 11% but grew 3% on an underlying basis excluding lipid sales for Covid-19 vaccine applications. The period also saw the first sales of phospholipids for drug delivery and intravenous nutrition following the completion of the Solus Biotech acquisition in July 2023. Whilst we were not immune from the challenges impacting the market, including customers reducing inventory levels, Covid normalisation and funding constraints for early-stage biotech companies, the breadth and diversification of our pharma portfolio enabled the business to deliver a resilient performance. Destocking primarily affected our heritage, consumer health ingredients for over-the-counter medicines, with lower Covid-19 demand adversely impacting Adjuvant Systems sales as well as lipids for Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. These challenges appear to be temporary rather than structural, but their effects could continue into 2024. By contrast, drug delivery technologies for Small Molecule, Protein and Nucleic Acid applications continued to grow.\n\nOver the longer term, accelerating growth and margins will be driven by the commercialisation of new biologic drugs, many of which we are supporting during clinical trials, augmented by incremental revenue from our own innovation pipeline.\n\nProtein/Small Molecule Delivery provides delivery systems for both the more mature small molecule drugs and the higher growth protein and monoclonal antibody (mAb) applications. Through the Solus Biotech acquisition, we have added naturally derived phospholipids to our portfolio which can be used as delivery systems for protein and small molecule actives, and for intravenous nutrition. In line with our strategy, we also expanded into bioprocessing aids, a target adjacency, launching Virodex as an aid for biopharma manufacturing and a superior alternative to a competitor product that is now banned in Europe. The first sales of Virodex were secured within three months of launch.\n\nAdjuvant Systems is the leading independent supplier of adjuvants which are used as immune response boosters in both commercialised vaccines and those in development. It will benefit from two new adjuvant partnerships agreed during the year with Amyris and BSI. One of these is a sustainable squalene adjuvant that is produced by fermentation and is free from shark-derived material that forms the basis of competing adjuvants, and is already being qualified by three major vaccine companies. We have also expanded our adjuvants portfolio through new launches from our own innovation pipeline including PHAD, a new proprietary lipid-based adjuvant already sampled into over 20 vaccine projects.\n\nThe growth of Nucleic Acid Delivery will be driven by the commercialisation of new nucleic acid drugs with the number in development continuing to grow, and Croda supporting the majority of those that specify a lipid delivery system. Clinical trials of nucleic acid-based drugs have increased rapidly over the last 12 months as pharma industry pipelines continue to grow. The strong medium-term growth trajectory for our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform is likely to be realised in three phases: firstly, mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases which are expected to come to the market from 2025, where we are working closely with the Big Pharma companies driving this development; secondly, oncology applications which require more targeted delivery systems; and thirdly, gene editing therapies such as a CRISPR treatment for sickle cell anaemia which we are supporting and was recently approved by the US FDA.",

With our Pharma business a top priority for capital allocation, we also opened an adjuvant systems lab in Denmark and are due to expand our R&D capabilities for nucleic acid delivery at Alabaster in the USA and in Singapore in 2024. We are investing an\n\nextra \u00a3175m over the period 2021 to 2024 to scale up Pharma production, particularly to meet forecast market demand for new nucleic acid drugs which are widely expected to come to the market from 2025, with the US and UK Governments co-investing up to an additional \u00a375m combined. We have invested over \u00a3110m in the programme to date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases with our drug delivery systems\n\nAdjuvants are used in vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens, inducing a stronger immune response and improving the efficacy of the vaccine. We are a leading supplier of aluminium and saponin-based adjuvants, used in traditional preventative vaccines, with a growing portfolio of advanced adjuvant systems for use in next generation vaccines. This means we can positively contribute to the growing demand for health and wellbeing. We are making progress towards our target of contributing to the development of at least 25% of vaccines identified as priorities by the World Health Organisation and are also providing adjuvant systems for new therapeutic vaccines such as a personalised vaccine for patients with melanoma.\n\nIn 2023 we signed two partnership agreements for the supply of biotechnology-derived Squalene and QS-21 adjuvants. With Squalene commonly sourced from shark liver and QS-21 produced by harvesting the bark of mature soap trees in Chile, these agreements ensure we will positively contribute to both patient health and biodiversity by establishing sustainable supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving agricultural output without negatively impacting nature\n\nThe application of coatings makes seeds easier to sow and the inclusion of micronutrients and plant protection products improves the overall performance of seeds while reducing the need for crops to be sprayed after planting. As such, seed treatment has a positive environmental impact, but many seed coatings contain polymer-based binding agents, leaving microplastics in the soil when the seed coatings break down.\n\nCroda has addressed this issue, becoming the first company to develop high-performing microplastic-free seed coatings for use on both vegetable and field crop seeds. The European Union has adopted legislation which bans the use of microplastics in agriculture within the next five years resulting in increasing demand for microplastic-free coatings which have already been applied to seeds covering several million acres. With soil health becoming ever more important, we expect to deliver incremental growth with microplastic-free seed coatings not just in Europe, but in other regions such as Latin America too.",

IS leverages investments in Consumer Care and Life Sciences, our core sectors, and plays a critical role in our manufacturing site model. This includes contributing sales volumes to our shared production assets and thereby enhancing overall asset utilisation, cost absorption, and ultimately profitability, as well as monetising co-streams so that we maximise the value of all our products. The business is regionally led, to enable flexible optimisation of manufacturing capacity matched against local demand, with global leadership from an Executive Committee member. It also operates a medium-term supply contract to Cargill, the new owner of the divested business.\n\nThe 2022 comparator year comprised the full PTIC business in the first half year and the retained business in the second half year. It is estimated that, had the divestment occurred at the start of 2022, sales in 2022 would have been \u00a3191m lower at \u00a3318m and 2022 adjusted operating profit would have been \u00a339m lower at \u00a342m. On this pro forma basis, sales fell 35% to \u00a3206.1m principally due to lower volumes, reflecting destocking and weak industrial demand globally. The effect of weak demand was similar on both sales direct from Croda and to Cargill as part of the supply agreement and limited the ability of IS to help optimise site utilisation. Pro forma adjusted operating profit fell 78% to \u00a39.4m as negative operating leverage compounded the impact of lower volumes. The impact of these adverse market conditions on the SIPO joint venture in China resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a320.8m taken at the 30 June 2023 balance sheet date. Including the impairment charge, the reported IFRS loss was \u00a312.0m (2022: \u00a379.9m profit), with the prior period including the full contribution from the divested business.",

Given the challenging trading conditions, we took some\n\nimmediate actions to address costs alongside driving improvements to the way that we work that will deliver sustained benefits over the long term. We actively managed our cash flow, resulting in a significant reduction in working capital and inventory days, and our balance sheet remains strong, enabling us to continue to invest through the downturn to drive future growth.\n\n## Currency translation\n\nThe US Dollar and the Euro together represent approximately 65% of the Group's currency translation exposure. Sterling was broadly flat against the US Dollar at an average for the year of US$1.243 (2022: US$1.237) and weakened slightly against the Euro to \u20ac1.149 (2022: \u20ac1.174) on a similar basis. The impact of changes in exchange rates for other smaller currencies, which represent 35% of the exposure, was more significant. Overall, the negative impact from currency translation was \u00a39.1m on sales and \u00a310.3m on adjusted operating profit. The disproportionate impact on adjusted operating profit reflected a \u00a36m adverse effect from the application of IAS 29 ('Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies') to reporting in Argentina and Turkey, and a \u00a32m foreign exchange loss from the devaluation of the Argentine peso, with the balance from the net effect of other currency movements. The transactional impact of foreign currency exchange was not material.\n\n## Impact of PTIC divestment\n\nThe Group successfully completed the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) business on 30 June 2022, with the retained industrials business, including the SIPO joint venture in China, becoming Industrial Specialties (IS). Given the divested business did not meet the requirements for classification as a discontinued operation, the first half of 2022 included the full PTIC business and the second half year only the retained business. It is estimated that, had the divestment occurred at the start of 2022, sales in 2022 would have been approximately \u00a3191m lower at \u00a3318m and 2022 adjusted operating profit would have been approximately \u00a339m lower at \u00a342m. Pro forma 2022 results have been adjusted for the divestment. On this basis, IS sales fell 35% to \u00a3206.1m and adjusted operating profit fell 78% to \u00a39.4m.\n\n## Sales\n\n| Sales                     | 2023  \u00a3m   | Price/mix   | Volume   | Acquisition   | Currency   | Change   | 2022   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|----------|-------------|\n| Consumer Care             | 886.1      | 1.9%        | (3.6)%   | 1.0%          | (0.6)%     | (1.3)%   | 897.8       |\n| Life Sciences             | 602.3      | 3.2%        | (15.4)%  | 0.7%          | (0.2)%     | (11.7)%  | 682.3       |\n| Industrial Specialties    | 206.1      | (3.9)%      | (55.1)%  | 0.0%          | (0.5)%     | (59.5)%  | 509.2       |\n| Group                     | 1,694.5    | 10.9%       | (30.0)%  | 0.6%          | (0.4)%     | (18.9)%  | 2,089.3     |\n| Estimated pro forma sales |            |             |          |               |            |          |             |\n| Group                     | 1,695      | 11%         | (30)%    | 1%            | (1)%       | (19)%    | 2,089       |\n| Pro forma adjustment      |            |             |          |               |            |          | (191)       |\n| Group (pro forma)         | 1,695      | 5%          | (16)%    | 1%            | (1)%       | (11)%    | 1,898       |\n\nReported sales were down 18.9% to \u00a31,694.5m (2022: \u00a32,089.3m).

In addition, underlying employee costs were broadly flat as a hiring freeze and natural attrition offset inflation-based salary increases.\n\nSignificant volume declines across most of our markets at a similar time led to low levels of capacity utilisation at our manufacturing sites, with negative operating leverage impacting profit margins. IFRS operating profit was \u00a3247.5m (2022: \u00a3444.7m) and profit before tax \u00a3236.3m (2022: \u00a3780.0m), the prior period having included the gain on the PTIC divestment of \u00a3356.0m. IFRS profit before tax included a charge for adjusting items of \u00a372.5m (2022: \u00a372.1m charge excluding the gain\n\non business disposal), comprising a goodwill impairment of \u00a320.8m to the carrying value of the Chinese SIPO joint venture in Industrial Specialties, a charge for amortisation of acquired intangible assets of \u00a336.7m (2022: \u00a334.3m), acquisition costs of \u00a39.6m (2022: \u00a3nil) and restructuring costs associated with changes to the Group's operating model of \u00a35.4m (2022: \u00a3nil). Prior year adjusting items included a gain on contingent consideration on a previous acquisition of \u00a36.1m and an impairment charge of \u00a342.2m, reflecting a \u00a334.6m write-down of goodwill in the Flavours cash generating unit and a \u00a37.6m write-off of unusable manufacturing equipment in Japan. The adjusting charge within net interest related to unwind of the discount on contingent consideration of \u00a31.7m.\n\n| Adjustments excluding gain on business disposal               |                             |                             |                             |                             | 2023  \u00a3m                    | 2022  \u00a3m                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Business acquisition costs                                    |                             |                             |                             |                             | (9.6)                       | -

        "page_content": "Group adjusted operating profit reduced by 33% on a pro forma basis to \u00a3320.0m (2022 pf: \u00a3476m), with an adjusted operating margin of 18.9% (2022 pf: 25%). With a large reduction in sales volumes, the biggest impact on margin was operating leverage, with reduced fixed overhead coverage accounting for a reduction in operating margin of around five percentage points. Adverse mix, principally lower Covid-19 lipid sales, also had an impact, reducing operating margin by around three percentage points.\n\nThere were a number of non-trading impacts that benefitted the adjusted operating margin by a total of approximately two percentage points. The most significant of these was a one and a half percentage point benefit from a negligible variable remuneration charge due to the impact of a lower share price on share scheme costs and because the annual bonus for 2023 was not triggered. Consumer Care also benefitted from the release of an accrual for an earn out associated with the Iberchem acquisition. Following the PTIC divestment, associated dis-synergy costs that were previously allocated to the divested business have been reallocated across the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors. This benefitted Industrial Specialties but reduced the operating margin in Consumer Care and Life Sciences by approximately half a percentage point each.\n\nWhilst there are likely to be some bounce-back costs in 2024 as trading normalises, including a higher charge for variable remuneration and higher employee costs, there are also opportunities for margin expansion from higher sales volumes and improved mix, particularly if volume recovery is broad-based across all markets. There will also be benefits from our simplified operating model.\n\nNet finance costs were \u00a311.2m (2022: \u00a319.0m), with receipt of \u00a3665.0m proceeds from the PTIC divestment on 30 June 2022 and\n\npayment of the \u00a3227.4m consideration for Solus Biotech on 4 July 2023 being the main drivers of changes over recent periods, as well as higher interest rates. Net finance costs are expected to be \u00a315-20m in 2024. Adjusted profit before tax was \u00a3308.8m (2022 pf: \u00a3463m). The effective tax rate on adjusted profit was 23.9% (2022: 22.8%) and the effective tax rate on IFRS profit was 27.2% (2022: 16.2%). The 2023 IFRS tax rate was higher than the effective tax rate on adjusted profit as the exceptional costs were mainly capital in nature and therefore not tax deductible. The prior year IFRS tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate on adjusted profit having benefitted from corporate tax exemptions available on the PTIC divestment. Releases of prior year tax provisions benefitted the Group's adjusted effective tax rate by approximately two percentage points, otherwise there were no significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported adjusted tax charge based on its accounting profit. IFRS basic earnings per share (EPS) were 122.5p (2022: 465.8p) and adjusted basic EPS were 167.6p (2022: 272.0p).\n\n## Improving free cash flow\n\nAs a result of active cash management during 2023, free cash flow improved to \u00a3165.5m (2022 restated: \u00a3157.4m), with a working capital inflow of \u00a329.1m (2022: \u00a3133.8m outflow). The working capital inflow was principally driven by lower inventory with stock days falling by approximately 20%. The improvement in working capital was despite the impact on receivables of approximately $60m of lipid sales shipped to our principal Covid-19 vaccine customers during the final quarter.\n\nNet capital expenditure was \u00a3170.1m (2022: \u00a3138.5m), driving future growth opportunities and supported by government funding grants in the Pharma business.\n\n|                                                    | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash flow                                          | 2023  \u00a3m                      | 2022 (restated)  \u00a3m           |\n| Adjusted operating profit                          | 320.0                         | 515.1                         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                      | 89.5                          | 86.4                          |\n| EBITDA                                             | 409.5                         | 601.5                         |\n| Working capital                                    | 29.1                          | (133.8)                       |\n| Interest & tax paid                                | (93.5)                        | (154.0)                       |\n| Non-cash pension expense                           | (4.4)                         | 4.5                           |\n| Share-based payments                               | (4.2)                         | (11.0)                        |\n| Other cash movements                               | 1.0                           | 1.0                           |\n| Net cash generated from operating activities       | 337.5                         | 308.2                         |\n| Net capital expenditure                            | (170.1)                       | (138.5)                       |\n| Interest received                                  | 8.3                           | 5.1                           |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                       | (17.0)                        | (17.4)                        |\n| Exceptional items cash outflow add back            | 6.8                           | -                             |\n| Free cash flow                                     | 165.5                         | 157.4                         |\n| Dividends                                          | (150.7)                       | (144.4)                       |\n| Acquisitions                                       | (241.8)                       | (21.2)                        |\n| Business disposal net of cash in disposed business | (4.6)                         | 579.0                         |\n| Exceptional items: cash outflow                    | (7.9)                         | (1.0)                         |\n| Other cash movements                               | (10.3)                        | (7.5)                         |\n| Net cash flow                                      | (249.8)                       | 562.3                         |\n| Net movement in borrowings                         | 125.1                         | (381.8)                       |\n| Net movement in cash and cash equivalents          | (124.7)                       | 180.5                         |\n\nClosing net debt was \u00a3537.6m (2022: \u00a3295.2m), including payment of the \u00a3227.4m consideration for the Solus Biotech acquisition that was funded from cash and debt facilities. The balance sheet remains strong with a leverage ratio of 1.3x EBITDA (2022: 0.5x), within our 1-2x target range. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had committed funding in place of \u00a31,050.0m, with undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3381.2m and \u00a3172.5m in cash. We received the most favourable rate of interest on our sustainable banking facility as our emissions reductions met the specified targets.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe post-tax asset on retirement benefit plans at 31 December 2023, measured on an accounting valuation basis under IAS 19, was \u00a364.9m (2022: \u00a375.2m). Cash funding of the various plans is driven by the schemes' ongoing actuarial valuations. The Trustee and Company are working on the 30 September 2023 triennial actuarial valuation for the largest pension plan, the UK Croda Pension Scheme. Initial results shared with the Company show that the funding position has improved and that the cost of providing benefits has fallen.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures (APMs):\n\nWe use a number of APMs to assist in presenting information in this report. We use such measures consistently at the half year and full year, and reconcile them as appropriate. Whilst the Board believes the APMs used provide a meaningful basis upon which to analyse the Group's financial performance and position, which is helpful to the reader, it notes that APMs have certain limitations, including the exclusion of significant recurring items, and may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe measures used in this statement include:\n\n- \u00b7  Constant currency results: these reflect current year performance for existing business translated at the prior year's average exchange rates. Constant currency results are the primary measure used by management to monitor the performance of overseas business units, since they remove the impact of currency translation into Sterling, the Group's reporting currency, over which those overseas units have no control. Constant currency results are similarly useful to shareholders in understanding the performance of the Group excluding the impact of movements in currency translation over which the Group has no control. The definition of constant currency profit has been revised in the year to reflect the impact on the Group of its operations in hyperinflationary countries. Constant currency results are reconciled to reported results in the review of financial performance below. The APMs are calculated as follows:\n- a. For constant currency profit, translation is performed using the entity reporting currency before the application of IAS 29 hyperinflation and any associated one-off foreign exchange gains or losses;\n- b. For constant currency sales, local currency sales are translated into the most relevant functional currency of the destination country of sale (for example, sales in Latin America are primarily made in US Dollars, which is therefore used as the functional currency). Sales in functional currency are then translated into Sterling using the prior year's average rates for the corresponding period;\n- \u00b7  Underlying results: these reflect constant currency values adjusted to exclude acquisitions in the first year of impact. They are used by management to measure the performance of each sector before the benefit of acquisitions are included, in order to assess the organic performance of the sector, thereby providing a consistent basis on which to make year-on-year comparison. They are seen as similarly useful to shareholders in assessing the performance of the business. Underlying results are reconciled to reported results in the Finance Review;\n- \u00b7  Pro forma results: these reflect the current year performance measured against 2022 adjusted for the estimated impact of the divestment of the majority of Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals on 30 June 2022. Given the divested business did not meet the requirements for classification as a discontinued operation, the first half of 2022 included the full PTIC business and the second half year only included the retained business. The Board believes that the pro forma information assists shareholders by providing a meaningful basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. Pro forma analysis is used by management for budgeting and reporting purposes including the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. In the first half of 2022, it is estimated that the divested operations contributed revenue of \u00a3191m, adjusted operating profit of \u00a339m and adjusted profit before tax of \u00a333m. Pro forma results are presented on a rounded basis due to the estimated nature of the measures. The level of estimation risk in arriving at the pro forma numbers is not considered material for the Group. Pro forma adjustments only impact Industrial Specialties and the Group, with no changes to Consumer Care or Life Sciences;\n\n- \u00b7  Adjusted results: these are stated before exceptional items (as disclosed in the review of financial performance below) and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the columnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a meaningful basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. The same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results;\n- \u00b7  Operating margin or return on sales: this is adjusted operating profit divided by sales, at reported currency. Management uses the measure to assess the profitability of each sector and the Group, as part of its drive to grow profit by more than sales value, in turn by more than sales volume, as set out in the Chief Executive's Review;\n- \u00b7  Return on invested capital (ROIC): this is adjusted operating profit after tax divided by the average adjusted invested capital. Adjusted invested capital represents net assets adjusted for net debt, net retirement benefit assets/(liabilities), earlier goodwill written off to reserves and accumulated amortisation of acquired intangible assets. The definition of ROIC has been revised in the year to exclude the Group's net retirement benefit balances from invested capital, given they are not operating in nature. Comparative information has been restated to reflect the new definition, resulting in restated ROIC of 14.4% for 2022 (previously 14.1%). Calculations and reconciliations are provided in the five year record of the Group's Annual Report. The Board believes that ROIC is a key measure of efficient capital allocation, in line with its policy set, with its aim being to maintain a ROIC of at least two times the cost of capital over the cycle, and that it is useful to shareholders in assessing the superior returns delivered by the Group and the impact of deploying more capital to grow future returns faster;\n- \u00b7  Net debt: comprises cash and cash equivalents (including bank overdrafts), current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities. Management uses this measure to monitor debt funding levels and compliance with the Group's funding covenants which also use this measure. It believes that net debt is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7  Leverage ratio: this is the ratio of net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted to include EBITDA from acquisitions or disposals in the last 12 month period. EBITDA is adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation. Calculations and reconciliations are provided in the five year record of the Group's Annual Report. The Board monitors the leverage ratio against the Group's debt funding covenants and overall appetite for funding risk, in approving capital expenditure and acquisitions. It believes that the APM is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7  Free cash flow: comprises net cash generated from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of exceptional items less net capital expenditure and payment of lease liabilities, plus interest received. The definition of free cash flow has been revised in the year to better align with the most directly reconcilable line in the Group's IFRS cash flow statement. Comparative information has been restated to reflect the new definition resulting in restated free cash flow of \u00a3157.4m for 2022 (previously \u00a3167.4m). The Board uses free cash flow to monitor the Group's overall cash generation capability, to assess the ability of the Company to pay dividends and to finance future expansion, and, as such, it believes this is useful to shareholders in their assessment of the Group's performance;\n- \u00b7  New and Protected Products (NPP): these are products which are protected by virtue of being either newly launched, protected by intellectual property or by unique quality characteristics. NPP is used by management to measure and assess the level of innovation across the Group.",

The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control policies, procedures and systems.\n\n## Risk monitoring\n\nGlobal visibility of risks identified by regions, sites and sectors is obtained through bottom-up risk registers that are continuously updated in our risk and control system. Using our global risk management framework (page 52), bottom-up risks are combined with top-down risks, the latter being identified and owned by a member of the Executive Committee, in our Executive Risk Register.\n\nMovements to the Executive Risk Register are reviewed by the Risk Committee during quarterly meetings, which also has standing agenda items to review and monitor internal and external emerging risks; IT and cyber risks; internal audit; and safety, health, environmental and quality (SHEQ) assurance. The Committee also provides the Board with visibility of the principal risks facing the organisation through quarterly reports.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWhile our Board owns and oversees our risk management programme, risk management accountability is embedded throughout our organisation:\n\n- \u00b7  Our first line of defence, our employees, have a responsibility to manage day-to-day risk in their own areas guided by Group policies, procedures, control frameworks and risk appetite. Local management, and ultimately the Executive, ensure that risks are managed and actioned according to these frameworks\n- \u00b7  The second line of defence is provided by management team review of each risk register, culminating in review by the Risk Committee\n- \u00b7  The third line of defence is through assurance over the effectiveness of mitigating controls, which is provided through internal audits, supplemented by reports from external assurance providers\n- \u00b7  Our Global Crisis Management Plan, which is in place to manage significant risk events, is owned by the Executive Committee\n- \u00b7  Croda's Group Fraud Policy, Group Code of Conduct, Group Code of Ethics and Group Whistleblowing Policy in addition to our controls framework are in place to prevent and detect fraud. Annually the Audit Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of Company's anti-fraud procedures. See case studies on page 53 for more details on what we have done in 2023 to enhance our fraud risk management\n- \u00b7  The process for managing climate related risks is fully embedded as part of our global risk management process (more details on climate related risks are provided on pages 59 to 69).\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite is the level of risk that Croda is willing to accept in the pursuit of a specific objective or strategy.\n\nWe define a risk appetite score for each risk subcategory, using a one ('risk averse') to six ('risk open') scale. For example, the risk subcategory for SHE sits at the lower end of the scale, meaning that we are not willing to accept risks of this nature and these must be reduced to a level as low as reasonably practical. At the other end of the scale sits the subcategory for innovation, an area where we are willing to accept risks to seize significant opportunities. Assessing risks against our risk appetite allows us to review and challenge the level of risk that we are taking for each of our key risks, to identify areas where additional controls may be needed, or where the level of control may be too onerous.\n\nOur risk appetite statements are compiled based on our Company values, strategy and capacity to absorb risk.\n\nWe use our risk appetite statements as an effective tool to communicate the Company's appetite towards each type of risk, providing a consistent guidance for decision-making throughout the organisation.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nWe consider emerging risks and opportunities as part of our risk landscape and define them as those whose effects have not yet been substantially realised and whose evolution is highly uncertain.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews emerging risks and opportunities from internal and external sources at its quarterly meetings and considers whether they should be included in our risk register.\n\nEmerging risks can be slow moving, when they have potential to materialise in more than a year, as well as rapid velocity, those that may materialise within the next year. The later are closely monitored and actively managed (see Artificial Intelligence case study on page 53).",

        "page_content": "## Principal risks\n\nWe consider principal risks to be those risks, or combination of risks, that, were they to arise and not be effectively mitigated, would cause serious disruption to our business model, threatening future performance, solvency, liquidity or our ability to deliver our strategy. Risks at this level are recorded in our Executive Risk Register with a high pre-control score.\n\nThe Group's principal risks, as reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, were revenue generation; product and technology innovation and protection; digital technology innovation; delivering sustainable solutions - Climate and Land Positive; management of business change; our people - culture, wellbeing, talent development and retention; product quality; loss of significant manufacturing site; ethics and compliance; and security of business information and networks. During our periodic risk reviews, we confirmed that all principal risks reported in 2022 remain relevant and no new principal risks were identified. The following principal risks were identified as heightened relative to 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  Revenue generation risk increased during 2023 as the risk of continuous escalation of geopolitical conflicts may exert further downward force on demand, consequently impacting revenue. Despite a difficult year with significant revenue and profit reductions, Croda's business model has remained resilient as evidenced by strong cash generation.\n- \u00b7  Security of business information and networks risk also heightened in likelihood during 2023 because of evolving technologies and increasingly sophisticated malicious activities worldwide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focus on fraud risk management\n\nCroda has a strong governance and reporting structure, set within a culture that reinforces 'doing the right thing' and embeds counter fraud behaviours throughout the organisation. It is Croda policy that we will not tolerate fraud. A culture of honesty, propriety and vigilance, which includes individuals at all levels, is fundamental to managing fraud prevention and detection. In 2023 the following changes were made to strengthen our risk management framework and enhance our ability to identify and mitigate fraud risks:\n\n- \u00b7  a new risk subcategory 'Fraud' was added to our framework under the risk category 'External Environment'\n- \u00b7  a risk appetite scored 'Risk Averse' was associated with this new subcategory (see details of our risk appetite scoring scale on page 51)\n- \u00b7  an associated risk appetite statement was crafted to reinforce stringent risk management practices throughout the organisation\n\nFollowing these changes to our risk management framework, comprehensive bottom-up risk reviews with focus on fraud were performed at regions, sites, and functions. This diligent and holistic approach allows us to proactively identify vulnerabilities and implement targeted measures against fraud from the ground up.\n\n## Emerging risk of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe mass use of Generative Artificial Intelligence, intertwined with AI's transformative potential, presents a significant emerging risk, demanding close monitoring and proactive management. At Croda, we acknowledge Artificial Intelligence as both an emerging risk and opportunity.\n\nUnderstanding the substantial impact of AI on business growth and operational efficiency, we are committed to deploying AI in a controlled, risk-conscious manner. This approach aims to uncover efficiency gains and unlock new business capabilities while mitigating associated risks.\n\nTo steer this journey responsibly and sustainably, Croda has instituted a multidisciplinary AI Steering Committee which is overseen by the Executive Committee. Its primary goal is to provide strategic guidance, ensuring the ethical, effective, and responsible implementation of AI technologies across the Company. By prioritising maximal value generation while minimising risks, the Committee aims to foster our values of 'Responsible', 'Innovative' and 'Together' (see details on our values on page 16).",

To grow, we need to innovate and also keep pace with our customers as they serve consumers globally in established markets and higher-risk developing markets. Failure to manage these challenges and the consequences of geopolitical tensions will adversely impact delivery of our growth objective. Acquisitions of adjacent technologies will dilute growth if they are not effectively integrated.\n\n## How we respond\n\nThrough our global sector sales, marketing and technology teams, we identify consumer trends and respond swiftly to satisfy customer needs through key technologies.\n\nOur direct selling model enhances customer intimacy (see our competitive advantages customer intimacy on page 13 for details).\n\nOur resilient business model and focus on controlling costs, managing cash flow and increasing sales activity helps to mitigate the impact of difficult trading conditions (see our competitive advantages - our approach to growth on page 13 for details).\n\n## What we have done in 2023\n\n- \u00b7  Focused on our 'doing the basics brilliantly' programme which aims to improve the customer experience and employee productivity\n- \u00b7  Reorganisation designed to simplify and enable faster decision-making and localised customer response\n- \u00b7  Progressed well with construction of new manufacturing site in Dahej, India, which will add capacity in fast-growth markets\n- \u00b7  Broke ground on new site in China for fragrances and botanicals that will bring production closer to customer\n- \u00b7  Expanded our R&D footprint in fast-growth countries such as new Pharma lab in Hyderabad, India\n\n## 2. Product and technology innovation and protection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk owner\n\nBusiness Presidents\n\nInnovation is the lifeblood of our business. It plays a critical role across our operations; it differentiates us from the competition, protects sales and improves our margins. Failure to leverage our global innovation teams could lead to a reduction in New and Protected Products (NPP) impacting growth and margin.\n\nFailure to protect our intellectual property (IP) in these products in existing and new markets could undermine our competitive advantage.\n\nOur technical research and development (R&D) teams, based in our customer innovation centres and application laboratories globally, focus innovation on customer and market needs and are embedded across our business (see value creation, from discovery to supply - problem discovery on page 14 for details).\n\nWe invest in: R&D, Open Innovation and Smart Partnership programmes, developing premium niches and disruptive technology acquisitions (see value creation, from discovery to supply solution development on page 14 for details).\n\nOur specialist IP team protects new products and technologies, defending our IP and challenging third-party IP where appropriate (see our competitive advantages - innovation leadership on page 13 for details).\n\n- \u00b7  Invested in our biotech capabilities enhancing the necessary skills and expertise to drive innovation in a strategic technology area\n- \u00b7  Obtained further external funding to support projects such as novel sustainable fragrance molecules, which can be considered transformational for Croda in our long-term innovation focus\n- \u00b7  Maintained strong NPP revenues demonstrating our commitment to the commercialisation of our investment in R&D\n- \u00b7  Enhanced the performance of our high throughput screening capabilities, which has supported the accelerated development of a number of candidate solutions focused on developing customer needs",

The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, as explained in the Group accounting policies (page 157).\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nWe assess viability through two lenses: a 'top-down' test which quantifies the magnitude of profit or loss required to endanger liquidity and our bank covenants and a 'bottom-up' assessment that makes use of downside scenario models, which reflect the key risks facing the Group, to test against the Group's financial headroom and leverage over the viability period.\n\nWe evaluate the Group's future outlook through five-year strategic and capital investment plans, with three-year detailed financial modelling being prepared. Most of the detailed sector delivery plans also look forward three years, including product innovation, manufacturing expansion timescale and market development. We chose to use a three-year period for the viability assessment because, given the inherent uncertainty of long-term planning, we believe this is the horizon that provides the most appropriate balance between accuracy and long-term visibility.\n\nOur strategic plan is built from a bottom-up sector view considering different macroeconomic scenarios and near-term risk factors, including weaker demand, inflation and raw material price changes. The base case model and downside scenarios are used to assess the impact for both the viability statement and the going concern assessments. For more on going concern see page 157.\n\n## Top-down liquidity headroom\n\nWe assess our overall capacity to withstand catastrophic events by stress testing the EBITDA reduction required to trigger a default under our funding covenants,\n\nand liquidity headroom available from committed debt facilities, including any which mature within the viability period:\n\n- \u00b7  Bank leverage covenant: the leverage ratio at the end of 2023 of 1.3x remains substantially below the maximum covenant level under the Group's debt facilities of 3.5x. Based on 2023 results, stress testing assesses that EBIT would need to fall by more than 70% to trigger an event of default. In the event that breaching the maximum covenant level was possible, we would also take additional unmodelled action to conserve cash and improve the covenant position (we also test the impact on our interest covenant; however, with a high level of fixed rate debt, it is difficult to construct a plausible scenario which endangers compliance with this covenant);\n- \u00b7  Unused committed liquidity headroom: at 31 December 2023, the Group had committed funding in place of \u00a31,050m, with undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3381.2m (see page 49 for more details). Current committed debt facilities largely mature in the third year of the viability period and, in normal lending market circumstances, we would expect to have adequate access to renew facilities as these mature. The Company therefore expects to have the necessary liquidity headroom available to cope with unexpected risk events during the viability period.\n\n## Bottom-up risk scenario headroom\n\nUsing the 'base case' model, individual downside scenario events were identified and modelled. In addition, five severe but plausible combinations of these individual scenario events were tested to assess the potential combined downside impact on the liquidity and covenant headroom of the Group over the three-year viability period. None of the individual scenarios or scenario combinations was found to endanger the liquidity or covenant requirements over the viability period.\n\nThe key scenarios tested were as follows:\n\n| Scenario                                                                                                                                                      | Key assumptions                                                                                                                                                                            | Principal  risks   | Scenario combination   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| New entrants or enhanced competition in our market  space make significant inroads into our business                                                          | Loss of business in Consumer Care, Life Sciences and Industrial  Specialties                                                                                                               | 1                  |                        |\n| Regulatory or reputational issues affecting individual  products or product groups                                                                            | Loss of contribution from significant products                                                                                                                                             | 1                  |                        |\n| Disruptive production or digital customer interaction  technologies are brought to the market by competitors  and we lose competitiveness                     | Loss of business in a major technology platform and competitive  attrition within Consumer Care and Life Sciences customers                                                                | 2  3               |                        |\n| Escalation of geopolitical upheaval results in sanctions  to relevant countries and the global economy moving  into recession, with significant business loss | No sales to sanctioned country and lower sales elsewhere, with  greater impact in Consumer Care than in Life Sciences reflecting  the different levels of exposure to discretionary income | 1                  |                        |\n| Failure to secure supply of key raw materials                                                                                                                 | Loss of contribution from products affected by lack of  constrained raw materials                                                                                                          | 1                  |                        |\n| Catastrophic incident leading to complete loss of a  manufacturing site                                                                                       | Uninsured loss of major manufacturing site resulting in lost  margin for an extended period Loss of business due to reputational damage, in addition to cost                               | 8 9                |                        |\n| Major ethics and compliance breach leading to  government investigation and fine Loss of main ERP system for prolonged time                                   | of fines and legal expenses Loss of contribution margin during the ERP outage, mitigated by                                                                                                | 10                 |                        |\n| Cyber attack                                                                                                                                                  | business continuity actions A significant cyber attack damages reputation and results in                                                                                                   | 10                 |                        |\n| Failure to demonstrate delivery against sustainability  commitments                                                                                           | Reputational damage, leading to loss of business in all sectors                                                                                                                            | 4                  |                        |\n| Product quality failure leading to a product recall                                                                                                           | Financial impact from damages and legal costs in addition to  loss of business due to reputational damage.

We develop innovative products which help our customers to reduce their own carbon footprint and we set stretching climate related targets as part of our Commitment to become Climate Positive 1 by 2030 (page 34 and Sustainability Impact Report (SIR) - page 13).\n\nOn pages 59 to 67 of this report we summarise material climate related disclosures consistent with the four pillars and 11 disclosures proposed by the TCFD, including the 'Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' released in October 2021. As part of these disclosures we have considered the guidance in Section C 'Guidance for all Sectors' and Section E 'Supplemental Guidance for Non-Financial Groups - Materials and Buildings' of the TCFD Annex. We also reference links to further information which can be found in our Annual Report, Sustainability Impact Report (SIR) and Reporting Data Pack (RDP) to supplement our compliance. We cross refer to our SIR throughout this TCFD section as that report offers us additional space to explain our strategic Climate Positive commitment, to illustrate this through case studies (SIR page 12) and enhance our explanation of our targets, metrics and progress (SIR pages 9 to 13). We continue to work to remain aligned with evolving climate and non-financial disclosure requirements as required by the Listing Rules.\n\n## Governance\n\n|                                                                                        | How we comply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | What we have   done in 2023                                                                                                                                                                            | Next steps and timeframes  supporting further  improvement                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| a) Describe the  Board's oversight  of climate related  risks and  opportunities       | As one of the three pillars of our Commitment (page 10),  climate risks and opportunities are core to our overall  strategy and as such the Board considers climate  related issues as part of its annual review of the strategy  described on page 77.

There is increased  international coordination and  commitment to achieving development  goals that reduce inequality across and  within countries. Consumption is  generally oriented toward low material  growth as well as lower resource and  energy intensity. | Assumes uneven commitment to  climate policies with some countries  making relatively good progress while  others fall short of expectations.  Disorderly scenarios exhibit higher  transition risks due to coordinated  policies being delayed to latter half   of the century and medium-term and  immediate progress being divergent  across countries and sectors. | Assumes the drive for economic and  social development is coupled with  increased emissions due to continued  consumption of fossil fuels and the  adoption of resource and energy  intensive lifestyles around the world.  Climate policies are implemented   in some jurisdictions, but global   efforts are insufficient to halt   significant warming. |\n| NGFS  scenarios    | Net Zero 2050                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Delayed Transition, Divergent Net Zero                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Current Policies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| SSP scenarios      | SSP 1-2.6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | SSP 2-4.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | SSP 5-8.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Orbitas  scenarios | Co-ordinated Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | BAU Projections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Three time horizons:\n\nShort-term: 0 - 3 years, this is aligned with our time horizon used in our viability assessment (page 58) and with our interim sustainability milestones focused on delivery by or ahead of this date. This time horizon encompasses the typical life time of our plant and equipment.\n\nMedium-term: 3 - 10 years, this is aligned to our strategic planning horizons. This time horizon encompasses targets supporting our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.\n\nLong-term: 10 - 30 years, this is aligned to our longer-term aspirations including our Commitment to be net zero by 2050.\n\n## Six time points:\n\nThe assessment considered six time points, each five years apart, from 2025 to 2050, with 2030 reflecting our medium-term timeframe.\n\n## Defining financial impact materiality:\n\nRisk impact is assessed using the same six point financial impact scale used in our group risk framework and is colour coded as follows:\n\n| Risk impact score   | Financial impact           |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| 1-2                 | Opportunity - Minor Impact |\n| 3-4                 | Low - Moderate Impact      |\n| 5-6                 | High - Critical Impact     |\n\n## Building the scenarios:\n\nIn line with good practice Croda commits to formally review the CSA at least every 3 years. The CSA was first performed in 2021, then refined and re-baselined in 2022 to remove the contribution of the majority Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business divested in June 2022 and include the climate footprint of businesses acquired in 2021. Multi-disciplinary workshop groups reviewed the assumptions for forecasting our growth (using financial assumptions used in our strategic forecasting process), and our demands for each of raw materials, energy and people. The baseline for our energy estimates and site water use are taken from our non-financial reporting system, Sphera, which is fed with quarterly actual data from all our sites globally. There have been no material changes to the organisation in 2023, and periodic risk reviews confirmed that our principal risks reported in 2022 remain relevant and no new principal risks were identified (see page 55). No factors were identified to impact on the validity of the 2022 CSA.\n\nModelled in conjunction with external scenario data from the NGFS, Orbitas Finance and SSP to forecast and quantify the potential levels of climate related financial risk in line with Croda's risk matrix, the results of our 2022 assessment are shared on pages 66 and 67.\n\nFor each transitional risk we also considered the impact under the assumption that Croda continues to operate as today (business as usual) and secondly that mitigating actions to meet our verified science based targets are successfully implemented. This clearly illustrates the significance of the mitigating steps Croda is taking.\n\nCroda climate scenario analysis has been conducted at an organisational level, however regions or sites that have material contributions to the overall risks have been identified, affording the opportunity to account for any dominant locations in the assumptions used.",

Within this, scope 1 emissions decreased by 17% and we have seen a greater than 69% reduction in scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our UK operations were 15,095 TCO2e in 2023 (2022: 17,271 TCO2e) representing approximately 15% of our global GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2023 upstream scope 3 emissions decreased by 27% and we are now able to report downstream scope 3 emissions for the first time (see page 11 of our Sustainability Impact Report for more detail).\n\n## Limited assurance of GHG emissions data \u2206\n\n\u2206 indicates where metrics have been assured (limited assurance) under ISAE (UK) 3000 and ISAE 3410 by KPMG, our independent assurance provider. See www.croda.com/sustainability for details.\n\n## Emissions intensity\n\nOur chosen measure of GHG emission intensity divides our GHG emissions (including market-based scope 2 emissions) by value added 2 , a measure of our business activity. The GHG emission intensity for 2023 has been calculated using assured scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data and estimated value added. The result for 2022 uses verified 4 scope 1 and 2 emissions and an estimated value added if the PTIC divestment have been completed at 01 January 2022. Results for 2018-2021 use actual value added and scope 1 and scope 2 emissions inclusive of the divested locations.\n\n## 2023 breakdown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurchased goods\n\nand services - 76.6%\n\nRaw materials - 66.5%\n\nPFR/tolling - 3.7%\n\nPackaging - 3.3%\n\nOther - 3.1%\n\nCapital goods - 12.3%\n\nFuel and energy-related - 3.4%\n\nOn this basis, our GHG emissions intensity has improved by 55% since 2018, indicating we are decoupling growth from climate impact.\n\n## Energy consumption and efficiency improvements\n\nIn 2023 we consumed 777,947,568 kWh (2022: 884,613,001kWh) of energy across our global operations. This included 101,237,029 kWh (2022: 112,990,828 kWh) consumed by UK operations.\n\nAs part of our strategy to improve the efficiency of energy consumption, 28 projects were implemented globally, realising 22,231,185 kWh of annualised efficiency improvements, equivalent to 3,798 TCO2e avoided emissions.\n\n- 1.  Our GHG inventory has been completed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) using the operational controls approach. Scope 1 emissions are calculated using UK Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting. Scope 2 emissions have been calculated in line with the market-based method set out in the GHG Protocol Scope 2 standard.\n- 2.  Value add: Croda Group adjusted operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Group employment costs including Directors, Share based payment costs and non-exceptional redundancies, at reported currency.\n- 3.  Our scope 3 emissions are calculated in accordance with The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Scope 3 standard and cover all relevant upstream categories. Scope 3 emissions are calculated using primarily LCA data, and where this is not available, an Extended Environmental Input-Output (EEIO) model method - using spend data, to quantify the emissions associated with a sector of the economy in a given geography.\n- 4.  Emissions data for 2018 - 2022 has been restated and verified by Accenture see www.croda.com/sustainability for their verification statement.

Detailed scenario analysis was originally conducted in 2021 to investigate the risks identified to have the highest financial impact from these bottom-up assessments. The updated modelling in 2022 reduced the impact of climate on labour productivity which, we removed from our disclosure, and increased our assessment of water usage which we then introduced. We have enhanced our reporting in 2023 to reflect our assessment of water impacts, disruption from both water stress and flooding, rather than simple water usage. We consider the geographical impact of these key risks below.\n\n## Transitional risks\n\n| Climate risk                                                                   | Description of risk/opportunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Geographical impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact of carbon  pricing on our  emissions                                    | Rising carbon emissions from our sites may impact  profits through increased direct costs if emissions are  taxed.

The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code for the period under review. The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.\n\n- For more information on the Board's activity see pages 74 to 77\n- For more details on the search for our new Chair see page 96\n\n## Dear fellow shareholder\n\nIt has been a challenging year for our business and whilst the trading environment is now beginning to improve, high inflation, rising interest rates and customer destocking had a significant effect on our financial performance. However, effective governance together with the strength of leadership of our Board continued to support the Executive on strategic investment through challenging conditions.\n\nHealth and safety continues to be a key focus and is at the top of the agenda at every Board meeting. It is also a key focus for site visits, with a briefing document prepared so that site specific key health and safety information is available in advance of the visit thereby allowing the visiting Director to effectively challenge any particular areas of concern or educate themselves on good practice for wider learnings. In June, the Board attended a safety training day at the Leek site where the Group's safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety of our employees and contractors.\n\nThe Board remained focused on sustainability and achieving our ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients, by becoming Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Reflecting the Board's commitment, it approved the creation of a Sustainability Oversight Committee to provide the Board with enhanced oversight of sustainability matters and strategy implementation as well as ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. In July, the sustainability team provided the Board with a training session which focused on the leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to social and environmental risks. See pages 98 to 99 for further information on the Sustainability Oversight Committee and the Board's focus on sustainability on page 77.\n\nThe Board oversaw the introduction of a new organisational model, moving to a more agile, simplified matrix structure with all regional teams reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences to provide a solid foundation for the next phase of Croda's development. This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to customers, empower decision-making through the organisation and facilitate the onboarding of new talent more effectively. See page 81 for more information.\n\nDuring 2023, the Board continued its oversight and challenge to the management team in delivering the Group's strategy. This included taking part in two dedicated strategy sessions with the Executive Committee team with discussions focused on the changing market environment in Consumer Care and the need for a flexible strategy to meet the expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, time was also spent understanding the evolution of the Pharma market towards emerging biopharma and genetic medicine modalities and the strategic focus on strengthening our current base, accelerating innovation and targeting complementary M&A. Further details on our Board strategy review can be found on page 77.\n\nThe acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium biotechnology-derived beauty actives, completed in July following the unconditional approval from the South Korean regulatory authorities. The acquisition provides access to biotech-derived ceramide and phospholipid technologies, and emerging capabilities in natural retinol and will significantly strengthen our Beauty Actives portfolio. Located in South Korea, Solus expands our Asian manufacturing capability and will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. See page 80 for more information on Solus Biotech.",

        "page_content": "The Board is always mindful of the impact of its decisions on our stakeholders and on the long-term sustainable success of the Company. On pages 78 to 83 we describe how the Board engaged with each of our key stakeholders and give some examples of how we have considered their interests in some of the Board decisions made during the year. The Board owns and oversees our risk management programme and has completed a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks. Further information is on page 51.\n\nOur success depends on our skilled and highly committed employees and throughout 2023 our people have demonstrated their resilience, adaptability and determination to persevere in a very tough trading environment. During the year the Board met regularly with employees, through listening groups, Board presentations and site visits. Further details on how we engaged with our employees can be found on pages 78 and 84.\n\n## Leadership and diversity\n\nBoard succession planning continued to be a key focus this year with my retirement as Chair of the Board at the conclusion of the 2024 AGM.\n\nDuring the year the Nomination Committee undertook a search for a new Chair to take over when I step down at the AGM at the end of my nine-year tenure. Following a comprehensive search process, in September we announced that Danuta Gray had been appointed as a Non-Executive Director and Chair designate. Danuta joined the Board on 1 February 2024, and will succeed me as Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in April. Further information about the rigorous selection process led by Jacqui Ferguson, our Senior Independent Director, can be found on page 96.\n\nIn December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be leaving Croda in June 2024. We are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she has our very best wishes. A search for her replacement is underway.\n\nHelena Ganczakowski stepped down at the AGM in 2023 having served nine years as a Director. I extend grateful thanks, on behalf of the Board, for the outstanding contribution she has made to the Board and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee over the last nine years. Her insight, support and challenge will be missed and we wish her all the best. The Board undertook a search for a new Non-Executive Director to replace Helena and on 27 April 2023, Chris Good joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Chris has spent his executive career in the consumer care industry with more than 20 years at Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, a global leader in prestige beauty. Chris' deep understanding of the consumer care industry and in particular his insights into beauty care markets and consumers are of great value to Croda and the Board. His appointment strengthens the consumer care knowledge and experience around the Board table, supporting our continued transition to a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences business. Further details on Chris' induction can be found on page 97.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe that diversity in the Boardroom is essential for innovative thinking and improves the quality of decision-making. I am happy to report that the composition of the Board continues to exceed the new diversity requirements of the FCA Listing Rules as well as the ambitions set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review for FTSE 100 companies. Two of our Board members are from ethnic minority backgrounds. We are also comfortably in line with the requirement that listed companies should have at least one woman in a senior Board position with a female Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chief Financial Officer. Further information on Board diversity, including the new Listing Rule disclosure requirements, can be found on pages 93 to 94.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board agreed to extend Keith Layden's appointment for a further year and my appointment up to the 2024 AGM. This is in line with our policy to review appointments annually once six years' tenure has been completed. Following the retirement of Helena Ganczakowski in April, Jacqui Ferguson was appointed as Senior Independent Director. Before making a recommendation to the Board, the Nomination Committee considers the contribution made to the Board and the Committees by the individual and their time commitments. No Director being considered for re-appointment took part in any discussion relating to their own appointment. Further information about the tenure of other Board members can be found on page 95.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, this year's Board evaluation was externally facilitated and I am pleased to report that it confirmed that we continue to operate as a highly effective Board with many signature strengths. Details of the Board's annual evaluation are set out on pages 88 to 89.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nOur AGM will be held on 24 April 2024 and provides shareholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with us and this dialogue is very important to the Board. As a result of the impact of Covid-19, from 2022 we offered shareholders a choice to attend the AGM in person or view the AGM remotely via a webcast. Take-up for remote attendance has, however, been very low with just one shareholder attending remotely in 2023 and no questions having been submitted by those attending remotely. In light of the apparent lack of demand for remote participation and to avoid unnecessary costs, we have decided to arrange our 2024 AGM on the basis that shareholders, their proxies and corporate representatives may attend in person without broadcasting the event. We will keep shareholder demand for remote participation under review in respect of our future AGMs.\n\nIt has been my great privilege to work with Croda and to serve as Chair of the Board since 2015. I would like to give thanks to my fellow Board members and all my colleagues working at Croda for their hard work, commitment and support during my nine-year tenure as Chair and I wish everyone every success for the exciting future ahead.\n\nDame Anita Frew DBE Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

Board meeting agendas are set through a collaborative process between the Chair, CEO and Company Secretary. The Chair ensures adequate time is allocated to allow effective discussion, with a typical agenda being structured to ensure a balance is maintained between reporting, approvals, strategy and governance.\n\nDetailed planning is undertaken to create an annual Board agenda programme, which ensures important strategic, operational, financial, cultural and corporate governance items are discussed at the appropriate time during the year, with additional deep dives into key strategic areas.\n\nIn addition to the formal meetings of the Board, a separate Strategy Day was held in June, attended by members of the Executive Committee and their senior management teams; see page 77 for more information. A further five-year strategic plan session was held in the autumn.\n\n## Outside the Boardroom\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors have direct access at any time to the Executive Directors, senior management teams and employees across\n\n## Split of the Board's time\n\nDuring the year, the Board considered a comprehensive agenda programme including matters drawn from the schedule of matters reserved for the Board and the immediate and prospective operating environment. A summary of the Board's activities for 2023 is set out below, along with an estimate of the proportion of the time that the Board spent discussing each area.\n\n## Strategy 40%\n\n- \u00b7  Five-year strategic plan\n- \u00b7  Sustainability strategy including a dedicated training session\n- \u00b7  Established a Board Sustainability Oversight Committee\n- \u00b7  Discussed and considered acquisition opportunities\n- \u00b7  Review of capital investment opportunities, including the approval of the development of a greenfield manufacturing site in China\n- \u00b7  IT and digital strategy, including AI opportunities and risks\n- \u00b7  Post capex performance review\n- \u00b7  Reviewed and discussed innovation opportunities in Consumer Care\n\n## People 10%\n\n- \u00b7  Approved the appointments of Danuta Gray as Chair designate and Chris Good as a new Non-Executive Director\n- \u00b7  Extended the terms of office of Anita Frew and Keith Layden\n- \u00b7  Monitored health and safety performance, both process safety at our sites and behavioural safety of our employees and contractors\n- \u00b7  Received a report from the new Director of Safety on key initial observations, strategy and priorities\n- \u00b7  Reviewed senior management succession plans and talent pipeline across the Group in relation to the new organisational business model\n\n## Governance and reporting 10%\n\n- \u00b7  Undertook an external Board and Committee effectiveness evaluation\n- \u00b7  Approved the Annual Report and Accounts and other financial statements\n- \u00b7  Undertook a Governance compliance review\n- \u00b7  Approved the renewal of the Group's global insurance programme as part of the risk management framework\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Board Diversity Policy\n\nthe Group, which provides them with the opportunity to have a deeper understanding of the Company's operations or to request information about specific areas. This contributes to more effective meetings and decision-making and strengthens the ability of the Non-Executive Directors to constructively challenge at Board meetings. The Chair has regular catch up meetings with the CEO, CFO, Company Secretary and members of the Executive Committee between Board meetings. This ensures that she is kept appraised of significant developments and emerging issues and opportunities as they arise.\n\n## Site visits\n\nIn 2023, the Board was pleased to be able to undertake several face-to-face engagements with colleagues from across the organisation. The Board's annual overseas Board meeting was held in Spain at our manufacturing site in Mevisa, with additional site visits undertaken to France and Denmark immediately prior to this. In addition, during the year individual site visits for our Non-Executive Directors were organised, with visits to Croda's businesses in India, Singapore, Korea and the US. During site visits, Directors meet a wide range of employees and actively participate in workforce engagement sessions through listening groups, town halls and informal dinners as well as receiving business update presentations. These interactions allow Directors to have discussions and receive direct feedback from a cross section of employees, which fosters better and more informed decision-making at Board meetings and acts as an important mechanism in ensuring that the voice of our employees is heard in the Boardroom.\n\n## Financial risk and performance management 30%\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed business performance\n- \u00b7  Approved trading updates issued during the year\n- \u00b7  Approved the Group's annual budget\n- \u00b7  Reviewed and approved the dividend policy and the annual and interim dividends\n- \u00b7  Discussed and evaluated key risks, internal and external assurance of each risk and risk appetite statements\n- \u00b7  Approved the long-term viability and going concern statements\n- \u00b7  Considered the Company's defence planning\n- \u00b7  Undertook a review of the Group's tax strategy\n\n## Stakeholder engagement 10%\n\n- \u00b7  Received updates on site visits undertaken by members of the Board including feedback from employee and customer engagement activities\n- \u00b7  Analysed the results of the annual customer feedback survey\n- \u00b7  Received updates on investor sentiment in response to financial results and trading updates\n- \u00b7  Received reports from Executive Directors and senior management on the sentiment of customers and suppliers\n- \u00b7  Considered stakeholders in discussions and decision-making\n\n<!-- image -->",

Safety is always the first matter he reports on with a focus on behavioural and process safety issues including relevant KPIs. He also reports on key Quality KPIs. The performance of each business is discussed, including sales, regional activity and competitor insights as well as any major customer, supplier and regulatory body issues. The global market and macroeconomic environments have also been a key focus given the challenging trading environment.\n\nApprovals that form part of the matters reserved for the Board include corporate transactions, capital expenditure, significant commercial contracts, the financial statements, and dividends. For example, during 2023 the Board:\n\n- \u00b7  Approved the trading updates in April and October.\n- \u00b7  Approved capital investments in Guangzhou, China and at our sites in Leek in the UK and Lamar in the USA.\n\nEach Board meeting agenda includes items key to progressing the strategic objectives of the business to enable the Board's understanding of the opportunities and challenges for the business in new markets, technologies and disruptive innovation. During the year the Board undertook strategic deep dives into the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7  The annual Board strategy review provided a focused opportunity to assess and review strategy to ensure it remained appropriate for the long-term sustainable success of the Company.\n\nThis typically comprises Board procedural and governance matters including:\n\n- \u00b7  Updates on changes to relevant laws, regulations, and governance issues.\n- \u00b7  Reports on compliance and insurance matters, including a review of policies and procedures on modern slavery, whistleblowing and ethics.\n- \u00b7  Board agenda planning, Board effectiveness reviews, Committee membership and the annual review and approval of Board Committees' terms of reference.\n- \u00b7  The CFO reports on monthly and year to date sales performance, profit, cash flow, cost base, capital expenditure and outlook for the year. She also reports during the year on performance against budget and treasury items (including liquidity) and keeps the Board abreast of investor discussions and feedback.\n- \u00b7  The Board receives quarterly reports from members of the Executive Committee in relation to all aspects of the business, including market sectors, regional delivery, sustainability, operations, innovation, people, risk and functional updates. These include sustainability related non-financial KPIs and are in addition to the deep dive sessions covered under the Board's annual programme of business.\n- \u00b7  The Board closely monitors the trading environment and approved two unscheduled trading updates issued during the year.\n- \u00b7  Discussed acquisition opportunities, which were not progressed.\n- \u00b7  Approved Chris Good's and Danuta Gray's appointments.\n- \u00b7  Approved the Group's IT strategy, including AI risks and opportunities.\n- \u00b7  Approval of the full year and half year dividends.\n- \u00b7  Monitored organic development proposals in technologies key to achieving the Group's 2030 Science Based Target and progressing its strategic focus on biotech operations and capability.\n- \u00b7  Sustainability - as well as the annual review of sustainability leadership, the Board received a bespoke training session which included discussion on Croda's operating context and position, commercial implications and an outside-in perspective; see page 77 for more information.\n- \u00b7  Innovation - reviewed the Beauty Care business' short and medium-term opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Key areas of focus throughout the year\n\n## Board focus on sustainability\n\n## Sustainability embedded in our decision-making\n\nDuring the year the Board remained focused on delivery of our sustainability Commitment, which is a fundamental aspect of how we work, how we are judged, and how we judge ourselves, as we decouple our continued growth and increasing shareholder value from our impacts on the environment.\n\nThe Board approved the Group's annual budget, which includes investments to achieve our Commitment and sustainability strategy and to ensure sufficient prioritisation of resource to support this.\n\nSustainability plays a central role in decision-making with new investments having to meet our rigorous sustainability requirements. In September the Board approved the development of a greenfield manufacturing site at Guangzhou in China to help transform our Fragrance and Beauty Actives businesses in support of our fast grow Asia strategy. The Board considered the impact on the Group's sustainability commitments, with the use of sustainable materials for construction, zero scope 1 emissions, no waste to landfill and progress to zero scope 2 emissions by buying renewable electricity as available. The acceleration of botanical actives sits alongside traditional Chinese medicine using locally sourced ingredients, meeting consumer demand for sustainability and 'clean beauty'.\n\nThe Board decided to proceed with the development of the Pharma expansion programme at the Lamar greenfield site in Pennsylvania in line with our strategy to grow our Nucleic Acid Delivery business and our commitment to contribute to the development and commercialisation of 25% of WHO-listed pipeline vaccines. The Board also took account of the site's five-year plan to target a carbon free manufacturing footprint.\n\nIn December 2022, the Board approved the acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium biotechnology-derived ingredients for beauty care and pharmaceuticals. The acquisition enhances our sustainable biotechnology capabilities as well as consolidating our position as a global leader in sustainable actives with a North Asian manufacturing and innovation facility.\n\n## Monitoring and awareness\n\nThe Board receives quarterly sustainability reports which include a balanced scorecard against our Commitment and enable the Board to challenge the pace of change and resource allocation. The Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmonitored progress against the decarbonisation roadmaps produced for all sites in 2022 and oversaw the development of scope 3 reporting, including the quantification of downstream emissions fundamental to Croda and our customers, and reviewed and challenged progress in meeting the key milestones forming part of our sustainability commitments.\n\nDuring the year a number of site visits were undertaken by our Directors and in advance of these a sustainability and safety briefing note is prepared to enable the visiting Director to have a Group perspective as well as focusing on relevant areas of interest and also any areas of concern.\n\nAs part of its annual risk review, the Board confirmed that 'Delivering sustainable solutions - Climate and Land Positive' continues to be a principal risk. See pages 51 to 53 for more information on our risk management process and pages 59 to 67 for our TCFD disclosures including our approach to identifying and assessing climate-related risk and integration into the risk management framework.\n\nThe Board and Audit Committee reviewed how best to ensure that the business complies with relevant standards and that it has assurance on the accuracy and reliability of climate-related and other sustainability disclosures and approved the appointment of an external assurance partner to provide limited assurance of significant climate and gender diversity KPIs.\n\n## Ensuring the Board has sufficient knowledge and expertise\n\nThe Board determined in the 2022 Board evaluation that sustainability was an area that it would benefit from further training given the ever evolving regulatory and reporting landscape. In July the Board received a sustainability training session focusing on its leadership role in ensuring Croda responds to ESG risks and opportunities and the need for enhanced transparency to satisfy our stakeholders. The sessions helped to improve understanding, explore Croda's leadership response and priorities and enrich the Directors' own thinking and perspective.\n\nFollowing a number of discussions, the Board established the Sustainability Oversight Committee. The Committee's support will be fundamental as the Group seeks to manage the risks that come with climate change and to navigate through an increasingly stringent regulatory environment. Further details are set out in the Sustainability Oversight Committee report on pages 98 to 99.\n\n## Strategy review\n\nThe annual Board strategy review provides a focused opportunity to assess and review the Company's strategy and ensure that it continues to be appropriate. In 2023, the theme was delivery in a challenging market environment.\n\nIn Consumer Care, discussions centred around the changing market environment and meeting the social and environmental transparency expectations of consumers. In Life Sciences, discussions focused on the evolution of the Pharma market towards emerging biopharma and genetic medicine modalities and the strategic focus on accelerating innovation and targeting complementary M&A. The Board also discussed the alignment of Croda's organisational structure and talent management with future growth areas.\n\nThe day comprised presentations and break out groups led by members of the divisional teams, which encouraged more informal and interactive discussion and provided enhanced opportunity for Directors to share their external perspectives. A wrap up plenary session at the end of the day ensured that agreed actions and follow-up were captured.",

The investment would assist in the retention of key personnel and expertise as well as supporting the increasing customer demand for locally sourced ingredients. It also demonstrated Croda's belief and commitment in the local market and community. The investment aligned with Croda's sustainability strategy and safety priorities by providing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility providing a sustainable, carbon neutral, efficient and safe manufacturing facility to support the development of innovative and sustainable ingredients.\n\nHaving regard to the interests of all stakeholders, the Board concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to approve the investment in the project.\n\n## Relevant stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7  Customers\n- \u00b7  Suppliers\n- \u00b7  Employees\n- \u00b7  Shareholders\n- \u00b7  Communities\n\n## Completion of the acquisition of Solus Biotech\n\nThe acquisition of Solus Biotech, a global leader in premium, biotechnologyderived active ingredients for beauty care and pharmaceuticals, was approved by the Board in 2022 and completed in July 2023 following receipt of unconditional approval from the South Korean regulatory authorities.\n\nThe Board considered the impact of the acquisition on our stakeholders and determined that it was in the best interests of our shareholders as a valuable addition to the Croda portfolio and increasing the opportunity to deliver against many of the Group's strategic goals, including expansion of Life Sciences, strengthening of Consumer Care, fast grow Asia and the scaling of Biotech. For customers, it consolidated Croda's position as a global leader in producing sustainable actives as well as building the Group's biotech knowledge base with a portfolio of fermented (biotech derived) ingredients to meet consumer demand for more sustainable ingredients. It also strengthened our regional and local community presence. Increasing the Group's IP and proprietary know-how would provide opportunities for learning and development for both existing employees and our new employees from Solus Biotech.\n\nThe Board monitored the integration of the new business, with the immediate priorities being to establish Croda's core values, particularly in relation to safety, and to integrate Solus' natural ingredients into Croda's global selling network. This was as well as supporting the Solus team with Croda's technical and R&D expertise.\n\n## Relevant stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7  Shareholders\n- \u00b7  Customers and consumers\n- \u00b7  Employees\n- \u00b7  Communities",

This will drive greater accountability and responsiveness to customers, empower decision-making down the organisation and facilitate the onboarding of new talent more effectively.\n\nThe Board was kept closely appraised as plans were developed and progressed so that it could continue to review and evaluate the appropriateness of the new structure for execution of the Group's strategy and focus on innovation, sustainability and growth, as well as ensuring that the potentially unsettling change was introduced sensitively and professionally and in line with Croda's values.\n\nIn considering the needs of the Group's stakeholders, the Board recognised that although some employees would be adversely impacted, the new structure was in the best interests of employees as a whole as it would provide greater clarity on accountabilities and responsibilities with quicker decision-making and increased empowerment. It also determined that customers would benefit from better service levels and increased innovation, and for shareholders, the new structure would lead to a more competitive business generating increased revenues and profit.\n\nWhile it will take time to fully bed down and will inevitably continue to evolve, the Board is confident that the new organisational model will provide a strong and enduring base on which Croda can move forward.\n\n## Relevant stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7  Employees\n- \u00b7  Customers\n- \u00b7  Shareholders\n\n## New super refining project\n\nIn line with the Pharma strategy to be a leading partner for high purity excipients and bioprocessing aids, the Board approved investment in additional super refining capabilities at our site in Leek.\n\nIn reviewing the proposal, the Board considered a number of key areas, including an understanding of the new technology required and the approach to project management with safety a key consideration for employees and contractors. The Board also considered the commercial case and the extent to which the development of high purity low carbon products would increase Croda's product value proposition across the business.\n\nIn considering investment in the project, the Board considered the interests of Croda's stakeholders and concluded that the development would create opportunities for jobs and career development and provide a sustainable, efficient and safe workplace for employees and the local community. The Board also determined that customers and consumers would benefit from the enhanced and more sustainable product offering and for shareholders the investment would support the development of Croda's Pharma protein delivery strategy.\n\n## Relevant stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7  Employees\n- \u00b7  Customers and consumers\n- \u00b7  Communities\n- \u00b7  Shareholders",

A comprehensive investor engagement programme is led by David Bishop, Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director, and comprises results presentations, investor roadshows, attendance at conferences, seminars, site visits and ad-hoc meetings. This programme includes direct Board engagement through the CEO and CFO.\n\nThe Chair and other Non-Executive Directors are also available to meet with major shareholders to discuss topics including governance, strategy, ESG performance, and remuneration. The Board reviews monthly Board papers, meeting presentations and investor feedback following roadshows and other events. Direct engagement and the feedback it receives gives the Board insight into investors' views, helping to inform key decisions and the future direction of the Company.\n\nOur AGM offers the opportunity for all shareholders to meet with the Board in-person to receive an update on the business and to engage directly with the Board on topics deemed relevant. A number of investors and their representatives attended our AGM in April 2023 where Phil Ruxton, Chief Sustainability Officer (pictured below), gave an update on our sustainability commitments and progress to date. All results presentations are webcast live and with replay facilities available ensuring all investors and analysts have equal opportunities to engage with the business. Investors can also sign up to receive regulatory alerts at www.croda.com, ensuring they are notified of company updates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement in 2023\n\nIn 2023 we met with 369 institutions across 870 interactions, with 26 of our top 30 investors meeting management at least once. Engagement levels were slightly lower than 2022 given the absence of any large investor seminars, but nonetheless remained high and above FTSE 100 averages based on available benchmarks. Management engaged in roadshows after both full year and half year results, as well as roadshows in the USA, Germany, and France, ensuring investors had the opportunity to engage with them face-to-face.\n\nAs the trading environment rapidly deteriorated in the second quarter, the Board took the decision to issue an unscheduled trading update to the market in June. This was followed by another update in October as operating conditions remained challenging. Following both of these updates there was significant engagement with investors, with management making themselves available to discuss the trading dynamics and performance.\n\nIn addition to both in-person and virtual meetings we hosted a range of site visits during the year, aimed at enabling investors to build an understanding of our operations and what differentiates our business first hand. These visits included multiple visits to Rawcliffe Bridge in Yorkshire, visits to our Beauty Actives and F&F businesses in France, a large group visit to our Seed Enhancement business in the Netherlands and various other visits to sites in the USA, Singapore and China.\n\n## Meeting breakdown in 2023 by investor location\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meeting breakdown in 2023 by holders and non-holders\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Common investor questions\n\n## 1. When do you expect customer destocking to end?\n\nThrough 2023 our largest customers have reduced their inventories, impacting our sales volumes. While customers cannot reduce inventory levels indefinitely, calling an end to destocking is challenging. In Consumer Care, customer inventory levels in 2023 were lower than in 2022 and our sales volumes improved during the year. Inventory levels remained heightened in Crop Protection, with customer destocking continuing throughout the year, and demand remained weak in Industrial Specialties.\n\n## 2. Why have operating margins reduced and will they return to previous levels?\n\nAcross the Group we operate 11 large, multi-sector manufacturing sites. Historically the markets in which we operate have traded somewhat independently of each other, however in 2023 volume weakness impacted all our markets. This resulted in utilisation levels falling with reduced fixed overhead coverage at these sites impacting our margins. While we would expect margins to recover as utilisation improves, significant margin expansion will require a broad-based improvement across all markets.\n\n## 3. What is the future growth profile for the Pharma business?\n\nOur Pharma business is focused on fast-growth niches where innovation needs are high. We expect the Pharma business to continue growing, excluding the Covid-19 lipids, for which we do not anticipate any revenue in 2024. Longer-term, our Nucleic Acid Delivery platform, which enabled the roll out of Covid-19 vaccines, has a particularly exciting growth pipeline with customers developing new mRNA vaccines that we expect to start commercialising from 2025.\n\n## 4. What is a 'normal' level of capital expenditure for the business?\n\nCapital expenditure has been elevated in recent years as we redeploy the investment proceeds from the disposal of our PTIC business which completed in 2022. This includes our Pharma investment programme of \u00a3175m which was initiated in 2021 and will continue through 2025. Longer-term we anticipate capital expenditure to maintain existing assets and provide future growth to be 6-8% of sales.\n\n## 5. What is your policy with regard to returning capital to shareholders?\n\nOur capital allocation policy prioritises organic capital investment, complemented by bolt-on acquisitions and technology investments. We aim to maintain a strong balance sheet with net debt of 1-2x EBITDA and to make regular returns to shareholders through our ordinary dividend, with a track record of more than 30 years of progressive dividend growth. Our preference in the current trading environment is to retain a strong balance sheet, however, we will continue to monitor our capital requirements and make a special return to shareholders if appropriate.\n\n## Shareholder register\n\nOur shareholder base is largely made up of institutional shareholders across the UK, Europe and North America. Around 18% of our shareholders have a specific sustainability focus matching our ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients.\n\n| Top 10 shareholders               |   Holding (%) |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Norges Bank                       |           6.3 |\n| Impax Asset Management            |           4.5 |\n| Vanguard Group                    |           4   |\n| BlackRock Investment (US)         |           3.8 |\n| BlackRock Investment (UK)         |           3.6 |\n| MFS Investment Management (US)    |           3.6 |\n| RBC Global Asset Management       |           2.9 |\n| Brewin Dolphin                    |           2.9 |\n| MFS International Management (UK) |           2.4 |\n| Legal & General                   |           2.3 |\n\n## Shareholders by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * The data above is at 31 December 2023 based on register analysis conducted by a third party.

        "page_content": "## The Board and culture\n\n## Our Purpose\n\nOur Purpose, Smart science to improve lives\u2122, is made possible thanks to our distinctive values-led culture and the positive impact our activities and ingredients have on the environment and world around us. Our ambition is to become the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients and to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Our culture governs how we interact with our customers, how we work with each other, and guides our relationships with our stakeholders. Our customer-focused values of being Responsible, Innovative and Together are integral to the way we behave individually and collectively and to the way we do business. The Board seeks to continually reinforce these values so that the right behaviours cascade throughout the organisation, ensuring our culture and behaviours drive what we do.\n\nThe Board is responsible for assessing, monitoring and promoting our culture and understands the importance of setting the right tone from the top. The importance of personal traits that reflect Croda's values and culture are a key part of the selection criteria when appointing a new Non-Executive Director or, as was the case this year, a new Chair. See page 96 for more information on the Chair selection process.\n\n## Monitoring our culture\n\nGreat emphasis is placed by the Board on ensuring that our culture is aligned to our Purpose, values and strategy and one of the Board's key focus areas is to monitor and assess culture across the Group. Although culture is not tangible and cannot be assessed by metrics alone, the Board uses multiple information sources and KPIs to help to judge and assess how our culture is embedded in the organisation, how it shows across employee sentiment, and how it is observed in behaviours and trends. These include:\n\n- \u00b7  Regular meetings with members of the Executive Committee and management.\n- \u00b7  Employee survey results and response rates.\n- \u00b7  Feedback from employee engagement.\n- \u00b7  Quarterly safety and employee wellbeing data.\n- \u00b7  Feedback from shareholders.\n- \u00b7  Employee retention rates.\n- \u00b7  Diversity and inclusion metrics - such as gender balance, balanced shortlists, diversity on development programmes.\n- \u00b7  Ethics and whistleblowing reports.\n\nThe Board monitors the results and response rates of the regular pulse surveys undertaken during the year by all our employees across the Group. Each survey has a focus on particular aspects of culture, for example, Croda being a 'Great place to work'. In 2023 the surveys mirrored those of the previous year so that progress on regional and local actions to improve the workplace and employee experience could be assessed.\n\nDuring the year the Board had oversight of initiatives focused on facilitating inclusion such as the Solaris programme which supports the pipeline of talent from underrepresented groups, including those from an ethnic minority. Steve Foots gave a presentation at a Solaris alumni session which prompted views from different perspectives and increased the understanding of challenges faced by minority groups.\n\nAs a business, we run a number of development programmes for high performing and high potential senior colleagues. The senior leader mentoring programme enables the Directors and Executive Committee members to interact directly with a diverse group of talent from a range of functions across the business and support them in their professional growth through guidance, support and knowledge transfer. During the year, separate sessions of the Group's Leadership Development Group, for high performing and high potential senior colleagues, were attended by Steve Foots and Nawal Ouzren. Steve attended a session in San Francisco and Nawal attended Ashridge Business School for a\n\nmodule on Leading with impact and authenticity. Nawal took part in group discussions, a Q&A and joined the group for dinner which provided her with the opportunity to provide her insights and experiences in senior leadership roles and a perspective from the Boardroom. A session of the Women Lead Affinity Group in the USA was attended by Anita Frew which enabled her to share her experience and perspectives as a successful female leader. As well as benefitting the participants, these interactions help the Directors to build relationships with our highest potential employees and leaders. The Board remains engaged in the furtherance of diversity and inclusion initiatives across the business.\n\nIn June, Croda was included in the Sunday Times Best Places to Work following a third-party assessment of culture and workplace experience which concluded that Croda reflected good practice for employee engagement and wellbeing in the workplace. The nationwide survey honours and celebrates Britain's top employers and is a clear representation of the positive experience of our employees and Croda's culture and values.\n\n## Listening to our employees\n\nIn view of Croda's global operations, the Board decided that the most effective way of organising its engagement with employees was to continue to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors and to utilise the variety of mechanisms in place. The Board is comfortable that it can continue to rely on alternative methods to engage with employees, rather than one of the three methods outlined in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nIn addition to formal Board meetings, during the year our NonExecutive Directors visited operational sites in India, Singapore, Spain, France, Denmark, and the USA in order to better understand the Group's businesses and operations in these countries. These visits allow the Directors to observe the Group's operations in action, reinforce their knowledge and enable them to experience at first hand the culture of the Group. As part of these visits, wherever possible, the visiting Director leads workforce engagement sessions including listening groups and town halls with a diverse range of employees. A wide range of topics are discussed including those that are particular to the site and those of a more business and strategic nature. Topics which arose during the year included: knowledge management, safety, local business opportunities, organisational effectiveness, digitisation and data, human performance initiatives, serving customers and current trading. Feedback is then provided to the Board on discussions held and the Board's response on key themes and insights is in turn relayed back to those employees who attended thereby creating a feedback loop between the Board and employees. The Company Secretary takes responsibility for any actions requiring follow up. Perspectives from employees are taken into account in decisionmaking. For example, employee feedback regarding challenges around operational effectiveness within a matrix structure was a key factor in the development of the Group's new organisational model. See page 81 for more details.\n\nAs well as individual site visits, during the year the Board undertook a safety focused visit to our site at Leek which included discussions with the site management team, process engineers and safety managers. Extensive construction activities were underway at the time of the visit which enabled the Board to understand the additional process safety risks and protocols in place. In February the Board held an informal lunch with the Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs team at the Cowick office. As well as meeting the team, this provided the Board with key insights into the areas of innovation, ingredient defence and global registrations as well enabling a better understanding of the key challenges faced by the team.",

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the overall leadership of the Group. In this role, it oversees the development and delivery of a clear Group strategy in line with our Purpose.\n\nAt the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 Directors: the Chair; the Group Chief Executive; the Chief Financial Officer; seven independent Non-Executive Directors, including from 1 February 2024, the Chair designate; and one non-independent Non-Executive Director, who was the Company's Chief Technology Officer until his retirement in 2017. The size of the Board allows time for constructive debate and challenge on key elements of the Company's performance and strategic projects and enables all Directors' views to be heard. It monitors operational and financial performance against agreed goals and objectives and ensures that appropriate controls and systems exist to manage risk and that there are the necessary financial resources and people with the necessary skills to achieve the strategic goals the Board has set. The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of business, financial and international skills and experience, which provide appropriate balance and diversity of thought. The Executive Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when developing strategic plans. The Directors' biographical details are on pages 72 to 73. The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval. These matters include approving the Group's strategy and budget, material corporate transactions and the authorisation of capital expenditure above delegated authority limits. They also include matters relating to risk management, approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, dividends, appointing new Directors and significant communications to shareholders. The full schedule of matters reserved for the Board can be found in the governance section at www.croda.com.\n\nThe Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and others through its Committees, details of which can be found on page 87. In recognition of the importance of sustainability in achieving our Purpose and delivering our strategy as well as the growing and increasingly complex regulatory landscape, in 2023 the Board decided to establish a Sustainability Oversight Committee. Further details of the role of the Sustainability Oversight Committee are on pages 98 to 99.\n\nExecution of the strategy and day-to-day management of the Company's business is delegated to the Executive Committee, and subsequently to senior leadership teams where relevant, with the Board retaining responsibility for overseeing, guiding and holding management to account. In addition to its monthly scheduled meetings, the Board met and heard from the Executive Committee members, senior management and a wider range of colleagues on a regular basis. Contributions from the Executive Committee members can be found throughout this report.\n\nThe terms of reference for each Board Committee can be found at www.croda.com.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and sets the tone from the top, promoting a culture of openness and debate and effective communication between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. She creates an environment at Board meetings in which all Directors are able to contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy debate and constructive challenge.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThe Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chair and acts as an intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors, where necessary. She is available to shareholders where communication through the Chair or Executive Directors has not been successful or where it may not seem appropriate. During the year, our Senior Independent Director played a critical role in leading the search for our new Chair.\n\n## Independent Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe role of the independent Non-Executive Directors is central to an effective and accountable Board structure as they provide strategic and specialist guidance together with effective governance. They constructively challenge the Executive Directors and scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and ensure all stakeholder views are considered.\n\n## Non-independent Non-Executive Director\n\nHaving served Croda for 34 years, the latter six of which were as a member of the Board, Keith Layden is not considered independent. However, because of his experience, Keith contributes strongly to the Board's culture and personality, and adds unique and valuable insight as well as constructive challenge to Board discussions, in particular in relation to innovation and R&D.\n\n## Group Chief Executive\n\nThe Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of the Group's business and for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular reports to the Board.\n\n## Chief Financial Officer\n\nThe role of Chief Financial Officer is to bring a commercial and financial perspective to the Boardroom. Working with the Group Chief Executive, she is responsible for the leadership and management of the Company according to the strategic direction set by the Board. She leads the global finance function and oversees the relationship with the investment community.\n\n## Group General Counsel and Company Secretary\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is Secretary to the Board and its Committees. He works closely with the Chair in the formulation of meeting agendas and annual agenda programmes. He ensures that Board procedures are complied with and also advises on regulatory compliance and corporate governance. This role is to support the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors.",

At present there are nine such Directors, including the Chair, the Chair designate and the Senior Independent Director, each of whom has significant commercial experience. Details of their experience is on pages 72 to 73.\n\nThe independence of the Non-Executive Directors is kept under review to ensure continuing independence and objective judgement. The Chair was independent upon her appointment in 2015 and both the Chair as head of the Board and the Chief Executive as head of executive management have clearly defined roles. Further information on their roles is included on page 86. With the exception of Keith Layden, the Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors who served during the year are independent in character and judgement, with no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. Keith Layden is not considered independent, having served as the Company's Chief Technology Officer prior to retirement from the Company and appointment as a Non-Executive Director in May 2017.\n\n## Director induction\n\nNew Non-Executive Directors receive a tailored induction that focuses on the Group's culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, operations and governance. The aim is to enable a new Director to integrate into the Board as quickly as possible so that they are able to contribute to business and strategy discussions and provide effective challenge. Induction programmes are developed by the Company Secretary and discussions start well in advance of the appointment date to tailor the experience to the existing knowledge and experience and include meetings with members of the Board and Executive Committee, key senior managers and the Group's audit partner and other key advisers. A schedule of country and site visits is also arranged which enables a new Director to gain insight into business operations and culture. See page 97 for further information on Chris Good's induction programme this year and the planned induction for Danuta Gray for her role as Chair of Croda.\n\nAll new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including previous Board and Committee papers; recent reports from the external auditor; the Group's risk register and Schedule of Principal\n\nRisks; the latest budget and strategic plan; recent sell-side analyst reports and feedback from our stakeholder engagement programmes; information on our sustainability initiatives; matters reserved for the Board; the Committee terms of reference and other key policies.\n\n## Training\n\nAll Directors keep their knowledge and skills up to date and include training discussions with the Chair in their annual performance reviews. As required, professional advisers are invited to provide in-depth updates and the Board also receives updates on market trends and environmental, technological and social considerations when appropriate. The Company Secretary provides regular updates to the Board and its Committees on regulatory and corporate governance matters and Directors receive training on their duties under Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 as part of their induction process from the Group's corporate lawyers. All Directors participate in online compliance training courses as required, including competition law and anti-bribery and corruption. At induction, and as requirements change, training is provided on governance, legal and regulatory matters and specific training is provided when requested by the Directors. In June, the Board attended a site safety training day at Leek where the Group's safety values were reiterated and the Board was able to engage with both process safety protocols and the behavioural safety of our employees and contractors. In July, the Sustainability team provided the Board with a training session which focused on the leadership role the Board has in ensuring that Croda responds to social and environmental risks. See page 77 for further information. To remain up to date with wider issues the Directors are encouraged to participate in events hosted by external organisations to develop broader perspectives. For example, during the year Chris Good attended a sustainability event hosted by Critical Eye to enhance his knowledge in this area.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nThe Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each year and, in line with our three-year cycle, this year's review was carried out by an external facilitator. Heidrick & Struggles were appointed and were able to build upon their existing knowledge of Croda and its Board, following their external review in 2020. The process included virtual interviews with all Board members and selected executives, an anonymous online questionnaire, in-person observations of Board and Committee meetings, and a review of",

Heidrick & Struggles presented a review of their findings to the Board at its December meeting highlighting the areas of greatest effectiveness as well as areas for development. See below for more information on this year's externally facilitated review.\n\nThe Chair and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors present to allow an additional opportunity to discuss areas relevant to the operation of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors also met on their own, without the Chair.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director met with the Chair to provide feedback on her performance following discussions with the other Non-Executive Directors and the Executive management to gather their views. It was agreed that the Chair remained dedicated to her role and that she creates a culture of trust, openness and debate, facilitating an atmosphere of challenge whilst encouraging the effective contribution of all Board members.\n\nThe Chair met and provided feedback to each Non-Executive Director and the Executive Directors. Following these discussions, the Chair was satisfied that all the Directors continued to be effective and demonstrate commitment to the role, including having time to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out all their duties.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has an established process in place for reviewing and monitoring potential conflicts of interests. The Company's Articles of Association allow the non-conflicted members of the Board to authorise an actual or potential conflict situation. Directors holding significant commitments outside the Company are required to disclose them prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there are any changes. Actual and potential conflicts of interest are included on a register which is maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed annually.\n\nDuring the year the Chair and the Company Secretary discussed any potential or perceived conflict of interest with John Ramsay's directorship of DSM/Firmenich following their merger in 2023, and concluded that no conflict of interest existed but that this would be\n\n## Board evaluation\n\n## Outcome\n\nOverall the evaluation concluded that the Board was highly effective with many signature strengths.\n\n## Strengths\n\nBoard dynamics - the Board is open, collegiate, collaborative, approachable, supportive and interested. Egos are noticeably absent and there is a high degree of trust with the Board seen as 'one' with good relationships amongst the Directors and with the executive team. A strong onboarding process has led to the successful integration of new Directors.\n\nComposition - the Board possesses comprehensive coverage across all markets and segments of Croda's businesses with the newest Board members bringing a breadth of experience and relevant expertise. The composition of the Board is aligned with strategy. There has also been an improvement in diversity, both in terms of gender and ethnicity as well as background. Overall the Board is seen as having the skills and backgrounds to effectively steer strategic directions.\n\nCommitment - all Board members are personally committed to Croda's success and dedicate time outside the Boardroom, for\n\nkept under review. As a precaution, the Board approved any situational conflict that may arise.\n\nDuring the appointment of any new Non-Executive Directors other commitments are taken into account, in addition to whether or not a conflict or potential conflict would exist. Details of the professional commitments of the Non-Executive Directors are included in their biographies on pages 72 to 73. The Board is satisfied that these do not interfere or conflict with the performance of their duties for the Company.\n\n## Board support\n\nEach Director has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Where necessary, the Directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. Board papers are made available electronically one week in advance of meetings, which ensures that each Director has the time and resources to fulfil their duties. A resource centre within the web portal provides access to useful information about the Group, including corporate governance materials, finance and strategy information, Group policies and procedures, and information on topics such as risk and insurance. In order to build and increase Non-Executive Directors' familiarity with, and understanding of, the Group's people, businesses and markets, senior managers regularly make presentations at Board meetings.\n\n## Board re-election\n\nFollowing the individual performance assessments, the Board is satisfied that each Director continues to perform effectively, allocates sufficient time for their duties and remains fully committed to their role. The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors can be viewed at www.croda.com. Contracts for Executive and Non-Executive Directors can be inspected during normal business hours at the Company's registered office by contacting the Company Secretary and will also be available for inspection at the AGM. The Directors, with the exception of Anita Frew, will be proposed for election and re-election at the AGM on 24 April 2024 and details are in the Notice of Meeting.\n\nexample, site visits, sub-committee membership and specialist conversations, as needed. Board members come well prepared for meetings, aided by a focused agenda and timely issued Board packs.\n\n## Opportunities and future areas of focus\n\nAccountability - although there is a high level of challenge to executives, this could be greater and the inclusion of more data-driven perspectives in Board presentations would enhance the evaluation of strategic proposals put forward by the executives. Increased use of outside-in perspectives would also help to facilitate challenge and bring fresh perspectives to guide effective decision-making.\n\nCulture - whilst recognising the importance and strengths of Croda's culture, consideration should be given to the potential need to explore which aspects can be evolved to support the business' next phase of growth.\n\nSuccession pipeline - there is opportunity for the Board to place more regular emphasis on Croda's long-term succession and talent pipeline, increasing the time spent on wider executive succession as well as regular review of capabilities, skills and leadership skills.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nTo assist the Board in determining whether the Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable, the annual report team prepared a Board paper that, amongst other things, reviewed the process of preparation of the report, the controls in place to ensure consistency and reliability of the underlying information, identified the material positive and negative matters referred to in the report to ensure balanced content and provided details of the level of senior oversight of the content of the report.\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the Board enough time to assess whether it is fair, balanced and understandable, as required by the Code. The key themes and messages to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts are considered by the Board early in the process.\n\nThe Board considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts contained the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Directors received a full draft of the Annual Report and provided feedback. This review ensures that each Director has an opportunity to highlight any areas requiring further clarity as well as suggesting issues and areas that were not adequately covered or on which the report may have placed too much emphasis.\n\nThe key messages in the narrative in the Strategic Report and Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were reviewed to ensure they were consistent with the financial reporting contained in the financial statements. The Board reviewed the new and amended APM definitions made during the year and believed that clear explanations had been provided for the KPIs.\n\nThe Board reviewed whether the Annual Report and Accounts disclosed the successes and the challenges that had been faced in the period and that the narrative and analysis effectively balanced the information needs and interests of each of our key stakeholder groups. In particular, the Board had regard to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical issues and the potential for wider impact alongside continued inflationary pressures.\n\nThe framework and layout were considered to be clear and coherent, with a consistent tone throughout and clearly signposted linkage between all sections, in a manner that reflected a comprehensive narrative and highlighted the key messages appropriately throughout.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal controls and risk management, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial Business Reporting 2014, and in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board receives updates on principal risks and risk appetite on an annual basis.\n\n## Transparent policies and procedures\n\nExecutive management have established an organisational structure with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority which was reviewed by the Board (page 87). In particular, there are clear procedures and defined authorities for the following:\n\n## Financial reporting and financial statements review\n\nPolicies and procedures governing the financial reporting process and preparation of the financial statements are owned by the Chief Financial Officer and clearly and transparently communicated through the Group Policies system. In order to assess the financial statements, the Audit Committee regularly reviews reports from members of the finance team and the external auditor who is invited to attend the Committee's meetings. When conducting its review the Committee considers material accounting assumptions and estimates made by management, any significant judgements or key audit matters identified by the auditor (pages 143 to 145), compliance with relevant accounting standards and other regulatory reporting requirements, including the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, and the accounting policies and procedures applied (pages 101 to 103).\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is a key element of the Group's corporate governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and internal controls to the Board and Audit Committee and the Group. It supports the Group's strategy and objectives by evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business policies and procedures, system and key internal controls. In reporting on their reviews, internal audit makes recommendations to address issues and improve processes. Once recommendations are agreed with management, the internal audit function monitors their implementation and reports to the Audit Committee on progress at every meeting.

The Global Capital Project Director has developed a framework for managing major capital expenditure, and postinvestment review processes are completed by internal audit (at the Audit Committee's request).\n\n## Business risk management\n\nAs described on page 51 the Executive Committee has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing emerging and principal risks. The Board receives updates on principal risks and risk appetite on an annual basis and the Audit Committee receives reports from internal audit on the effectiveness of mitigating controls in place over selected principal risks at each meeting. The Group Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee (page 87), meets on a quarterly basis to monitor and review both current and emerging risks.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThere is a documented framework of required internal controls for business processes, IT, safety, quality and compliance, which form part of our business as usual activities and which are documented in controls manuals. Policies governing the internal controls are documented in the Group Policies system, which is available online to all employees, and each Group policy is owned by a member of the Executive Committee. Confirmation that the controls are being adhered to is the responsibility of managers, who together with their teams complete an annual self-assessment process against all controls which provides a snapshot of the control environment at the start of the year. Compliance with controls is tested by the internal audit team as part of their annual plan of work approved by the Audit Committee each year, as well as being tested by other internal assurance providers; see page 103 for more information.\n\nThe Board discharged its responsibility for monitoring the operational effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems throughout the year using a process which involved:\n\n- \u00b7  Delegation of review of systems of risk management and internal control to the Audit Committee, whose activities are described in detail on pages 100 to 105.\n- \u00b7  Receipt of written confirmations from senior management.\n- \u00b7  Board review of the report on significant control weaknesses.\n- \u00b7  Annual review of risk appetite statements and principal risks (page 51).\n\nThese processes have been in place for the full financial year up to the date on which the financial statements were approved by the Board. The systems are designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full statement of Directors' responsibilities see page 138.",

After a comprehensive selection process led by the Senior Independent Director, the Board decided to appoint Danuta Gray to succeed me and to help steer Croda through this next phase.'\n\n## Dame Anita Frew DBE\n\nChair of the Nomination Committee\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are reviewed annually and can be found in the governance section at www.croda.com.\n\n- For details of meeting attendance during the course of the year see page 88\n- For more details on the search process for our new Chair see page 96\n\nI am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## Main activities and priorities in 2023\n\n## Board changes\n\nA key focus in 2023 was the search for a new Chair to succeed me when I step down at the conclusion of this year's AGM. After a comprehensive selection process led by the Senior Independent Director, the Board decided to appoint Danuta Gray to succeed me and to help steer Croda through this next phase. Danuta joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in February and will be appointed as Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in April 2024. The selection process was led by Jacqui Ferguson in her capacity as Senior Independent Director with the whole Board engaged in the process throughout. The independent specialist executive search consultant Egon Zehnder (EZ) was appointed to assist the Committee with the process. EZ is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, and has no other connection with Croda or its individual Directors. See page 96 for further information on the Chair selection process.\n\nIn April, we welcomed Chris Good to the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director. Chris's deep understanding of the consumer care industry and in particular his insights into beauty care markets and consumers are of great value to Croda and the Board. His appointment strengthens the consumer care knowledge and experience around the Board table and supports Croda's continued transition to a pure play Consumer Care and Life Sciences business. Helena Ganczakowski retired from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in April and on behalf of the Committee and the Board I would like to thank Helena for her outstanding contribution to the Board, both as Remuneration Committee Chair and Senior Independent Director, for her insight and support. Jacqui Ferguson has taken on the role of Senior Independent Director, in addition to her role as Remuneration Committee Chair.\n\nIn December we announced that our CFO, Louisa Burdett, would be leaving Croda in June 2024 having accepted another role as CFO. We are sorry that Louisa is leaving but she has our very best wishes when she departs this summer. A search for her replacement is underway.\n\nThe process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for approval. It is the Nomination Committee's responsibility to keep Board composition under review, including Director independence and tenure. During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and skills of the Board using the skills matrix on page 95 as well as taking into account recent and likely future Board changes. Following review, it decided to initiate a search for an additional Non-Executive Director with recent and relevant financial experience to further strengthen the composition of the Audit Committee. The Committee is using an external search firm to assist in this process and we will report on the outcome of this process in due course.\n\nKeith Layden's and my own appointment were considered by the Committee. My term was extended up to the 2024 AGM and Keith's for another year. This is in line with the Nomination Committee policy that once a Non-Executive Director has served six years, any extension to their term is on a year by year basis.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity and inclusion\n\nAs a global organisation, we aim to recruit talented people that reflect the diverse nature of the countries in which we operate. We value the unique contributions that each employee brings to our business, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment where all our employees can fulfil their full potential. Diversity at Board level and throughout the organisation provides a broad range of perspectives, supporting the achievement of our strategy and contributing to our success and the Board views all aspects of diversity as important considerations when reviewing its composition. Our Board Diversity Policy, a copy of which is available in the corporate governance section at www.croda.com, is reviewed regularly and confirms our commitment to meeting or exceeding the target set by the FTSE Women Leaders and Parker reviews and our current Board composition exceeds the targets recommended.\n\nWe are also pleased to report on the new Board diversity targets introduced in the Listing Rules in 2022. Our chosen reference date is 31 December 2023 and, as at that date, the Company had met all three of the Board diversity targets of having 40% women on the Board, at least one ethnic minority director on the Board and having a woman in at least one senior Board role. We exceed all these requirements with a fully gender balanced Board, two Board members from ethnic minority backgrounds and three women in the senior Board positions of Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chief Financial Officer. Since the reference date, Danuta Gray was appointed to the Board as Chair designate and following Danuta's appointment, we continue to meet all three of the new Board diversity targets. We have not set any targets for senior management, but this is something we will be considering. In line with the new Listing Rule disclosure requirements, more detailed information relating to the gender and ethnic diversity of Croda's Board and Executive Committee can be found in the tables on page 94.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the gender balance of the Executive Committee and senior management teams (direct reports to the Executive Committee) stood at 39% female. We continued to increase the diversity of our leaders below Board and Executive Committee level. 40% of our Senior Leadership Group (comprising 36 of our most senior employees) are female, with the Senior Leadership Group made up of employees across 12 nationalities. While appointments at all levels will continue to be made based on skill and ability, all forms of diversity are key to ensuring that we have the right mix of backgrounds, knowledge and experience to meet our future business needs. Although there continues to be work to do to create further diversity and gender balance in the underlying management teams, diversity and inclusion is central to succession planning discussions and critical to the long-term sustainable success of our business.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Committee and the Board oversaw the introduction of a new Group organisational structure with all regional teams reporting into Consumer Care and Life Sciences to simplify business processes and ways of working. Some changes were made to the Executive Committee with the team reducing from ten to eight as regional delivery and central research were absorbed into each business. Sandra Breene was appointed as President Consumer Care and Daniele Piergentili continued in his role as President Life Sciences.\n\nAnthony Fitzpatrick will take on the expanded role of President Corporate Development and Industrial Specialties, Mark Robinson will continue in his role as President Operations and Michelle Lydon will continue as President Human Resources. Tom Brophy, our Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, was also appointed as President Sustainability. The restructuring also provided opportunities in the underlying management teams for several individuals identified through the organisation's review of talent and succession process.\n\n## Director induction\n\nAll Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme. This is tailored through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary and considers existing expertise and any Committee roles. All new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which provide easy access to key documents. Chris Good joined the Board in April and his induction started immediately to ensure that he had an understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which we operate and our core business activities as soon as possible. Further information on Chris' induction programme is on page 97. During 2024 the Company Secretary will be working closely with Danuta Gray on a comprehensive induction programme for her role as Chair of Croda.\n\n## Other activities of the Committee\n\nThe Committee reviewed the time commitment of the Non-Executive Directors which is assessed before appointment and on an annual basis thereafter. The Committee was satisfied that all the NonExecutive Directors remain able to commit the required time for the proper performance of their duties.\n\nThe Committee considered and concluded that, except for Keith Layden, all the Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria of independence. As Keith was formerly an Executive Director of the Company, he is not currently considered to be independent.\n\nThis year's annual Committee evaluation was externally facilitated by Heidrick & Struggles who have no other connection with the Company or individual Directors. The evaluation confirmed that the Nomination Committee was effective and well led with strong operating mechanisms. The very thorough and robust process led by the Senior Independent Director to find a successor for the current Chair was highlighted. See page 89 for further information on this year's Board evaluation and page 96 for the Chair selection process.\n\nLooking ahead, the focus will be on the handover and transition to Danuta as the new Chair and to ensure an effective induction programme to support this. We will continue with the search process for a new CFO and a Non-Executive Director to ensure that the Board maintains an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDame Anita Frew DBE\n\nChair",

Following a selection process involving five search firms, the Company appointed Egon Zehnder (EZ), an independent specialist executive search consultant to assist with the process. EZ has no other connection with the Company and has signed up to the diversity Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. Helena Ganczakowski as the Senior Independent Director and subsequently Jacqui Ferguson who succeeded Helena as Senior Independent Director, led the process.\n\n## Board discussion\n\nFollowing individual discussions by EZ with each Board member, a set of objective criteria were defined, including the experience, leadership competencies and personal and cultural attributes required to fulfil the role of Chair and meet the requirements of Croda in the future.\n\n## Nomination Committee process\n\nThe Nomination Committee appointed a sub-committee, comprising Helena Ganczakowski, Jacqui Ferguson, Roberto Cirillo, Keith Layden and John Ramsay, to focus on the search and selection process. The sub-committee met regularly and reported back to the Nomination Committee.\n\nBased on the role specification and having regard to the Board Diversity Policy, a longlist of potential candidates, from both the UK and overseas, was identified. Following an evaluation in relation to the assessment framework of potential, personality, leadership and experiential fit, seven candidates were selected for stage one interviews with EZ and Helena and Jacqui. Five candidates were then invited to proceed to a stage two interview with the rest of the members of the sub-committee.\n\nTwo final candidates were then invited to proceed to stage three of the selection process, which included interviews with Non-Executive and Executive Directors, the Chair and the President Human Resources. The candidates also visited Croda's offices and laboratories in Cowick where the candidates met with members of the Executive Committee and their senior teams, enabling them to gain first hand insight into Croda and its culture.\n\n## Jan - Feb 2023\n\nIdentify Candidate profile agreed\n\nNomination subcommittee appointed\n\n## Mar - June 2023\n\n## Interview\n\nInterviews with potential candidates\n\nCandidate longlist provided by EZ\n\n## Nomination Committee and Board approval\n\nFollowing detailed due diligence and feedback carried out by the Nomination Committee, it was determined that Danuta Gray possessed the required skills and experience to carry out the role and that she would bring sound leadership to Croda. She was considered the ideal candidate to promote the long term success of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders and the Board approved her appointment as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 February 2024 prior to becoming Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in April 2024.\n\n'I am delighted that the comprehensive search process for our next Chair has resulted in the appointment of Danuta. Danuta is a highly experienced NonExecutive Director and Chair with a deep understanding of growing consumer focused and high technology businesses in international markets. She has served on the Boards of a variety of listed companies and her depth of Boardroom experience and strong understanding of UK governance will be of enormous benefit to Croda.'\n\n## Jacqui Ferguson\n\nSenior Independent Director\n\n## July 2023\n\n## Assess\n\nTwo candidates selected for final shortlist\n\nShortlisted candidates visited Cowick\n\nFinal interviews held\n\n## Aug - Sept 2023\n\n## Select\n\nAssessment of shortlisted candidates\n\nRecommendation to the Board on preferred candidate\n\n## Feb 2024\n\n## Appoint\n\nDanuta Gray's appointment as a Non-Executive Director and Chair designate effective 1 February 2024",

He met with our corporate advisers and received briefings on the role and responsibilities of being a UK listed Company Director and matters relevant to his Committee roles. New Directors are encouraged to engage with the business and Chris met and heard from members of the Executive Committee and their teams responsible for the delivery of the Group's strategy and key business operations. This enabled him to gain a deeper understanding of our Purpose, the environment in which we operate and our core business activities. He also visited a number of our sites both in the UK and overseas, including Rawcliffe Bridge and our Centre of Excellence in Goole, as well as sites in Singapore, France, Denmark, Mevisa and the US where he was able to observe our operations in action and meet colleagues to gain further insight into our culture and business operations. In the USA Chris also attended meetings with some of our key customers to better understand the challenges faced in the current business environment.\n\nAs the new Chair of the Sustainability Oversight Committee, Chris held a number of deep dive sessions with the Group Sustainability team and sustainability experts in the business, as well as attending external training and networking sessions in relation to sustainability. This has enhanced his knowledge and understanding of our sustainability strategy framework and how our Purpose is embedded into our culture, with our ambition to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients and our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.",

They can be found in the governance section at www.croda.com.\n\n- For details of meeting attendance during the course of the year see page 88\n- For details of the key focus areas for 2024 see page 104\n\n## Dear fellow shareholder,\n\n## Report of the Audit Committee for the year ended 31 December 2023\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2023. This report provides shareholders with an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas considered when monitoring the integrity of the Group's financial reporting and the effectiveness of its system of internal control and risk management processes.\n\nDuring the year, I received regular updates from the CFO, the wider global finance team, KPMG's Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive management team, the audit teams and Croda employees have once again delivered high-quality and robust audit processes.\n\nIn December we announced that our CFO Louisa Burdett will be leaving the business in June 2024. Louisa is leaving with our best wishes and a search for her successor is in hand, a process that is well underway and one in which I am heavily involved.\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe Committee at the end of the year comprised six independent Non-Executive Directors. The experience of each Board member is outlined on pages 72 to 73. The Board considers that all members of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic direction of the Group.\n\nThese skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provide the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be fully effective. Nevertheless a further Non-Executive Director is being sought for the Audit Committee who also has financial and accounting expertise. It also meets the Code requirement that at least one member has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors attend the meetings by invitation.\n\nThe Committee met five times during the year and has met twice since the financial year end with each meeting agenda including a range of topics across the Committee's areas of responsibility. The Committee works to an agreed structured programme of business and meetings to coincide with key events around our financial calendar and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control process. I report formally to the Board on the Committee's activities after each meeting.\n\nTo ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the CFO, the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the internal and external auditor. Meetings without the Executive Directors present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate open dialogue and assurance. Before each Committee meeting, I also meet with the external auditors, the Group Financial Controller and the VP Risk and Assurance and before most meetings with the CFO to discuss control and compliance issues generally and specifically the detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure sufficient time is devoted to them at the meetings.",

The Committee challenged management on the statements and the underlying accounting judgements, including goodwill impairment considerations, acquisition and hedge accounting considerations for the Solus Biotech acquisition and hyperinflationary accounting considerations. Following its review, and after considering the evidence and accounting papers provided by management, the Committee was satisfied with the explanations provided. Consideration was given to the appropriateness of accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation of uncertainty. Recommendations were made to the Board supporting the half and full-year accounts and financial statements.\n- \u00b7  Monitored the Group's financial performance and ensured that management's judgements and estimates remained reasonable and prudent considering the two unscheduled trading updates issued in 2023.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Group's external reporting framework and use of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) and the updated and new definitions to assess ongoing appropriateness. The Committee was satisfied that the APMs reviewed were consistent with market practice of both the peer group and wider FTSE 100 companies, and that disclosures and reconciliations to statutory measures were appropriate.\n\n## Time allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Specific focus areas in 2023\n\n- \u00b7  Continue to maintain focus on cyber security and the delivery of projects identified in the information security strategy.\n- \u00b7  Maintain focus on monitoring the impact of major business change programmes on Croda's risk and control environment.\n- \u00b7  Monitor progress of control framework changes resulting from UK corporate reform.\n- \u00b7  Review management's oversight and monitoring of quality controls within the Pharma business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See page 103 for progress on these areas\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed consideration given by management relating to various Financial Reporting Council (FRC) thematic reviews and guidance for financial reporting.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the impairment testing reviews on goodwill balances on the Group's balance sheet and was satisfied with the output of the reviews. In conjunction with the Board, challenged management on the assumptions and forecasts behind the financial modelling and stress testing conducted for the going concern assessment. A recommendation was made to the Board to support the going concern statement. Further information can be found on page 157.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the viability assessment process undertaken in support of the long-term viability statement, based on severe but plausible scenarios (including different combinations of scenarios) arising from key risks and their impact on headroom and debt covenants. The Committee challenged the assessment period, assumptions and calculations in the modelling and scenarios, noting the effect they would have during the viability period and was satisfied that they were robust and well thought through. The Committee also considered and was satisfied with the appropriateness of the three-year period for assessing the viability and the severity of the stress-testing scenarios. A recommendation was made to the Board to support the long-term viability statement. Further information can be found on page 58.\n- \u00b7  Undertook regular reviews of the Group's litigation. The Committee receives reports twice a year from the Group General Counsel, Company Secretary and President Sustainability and was satisfied with the approach to provisioning and disclosure.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the accounting treatment of the Solus Biotech acquisition, including the purchase price allocation, the identification of cash generating units (CGUs) and the appropriateness of the foreign exchange hedge accounting applied to the acquisition. Impairment is not considered to be a key area of focus despite low headroom on the basis it is trading in line with expectations post-acquisition.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed and approved the response to the FRC request for information from its review of the Group's 2022 Annual Report as part of its routine monitoring of corporate reporting, specifically to clarify whether the Group's UK defined benefit pension scheme was open to future accrual and how the Company expected to recover the scheme surplus through reduced future contributions. We were able to confirm that the UK scheme remains open to new members and future service accrual, clarifying that the surplus can be recovered through a reduction in future service contributions. We agreed to update our disclosures to make it clearer that the UK scheme remains open to future accrual and to new members. The letter also included suggestions concerning areas where the FRC believes users of the accounts would benefit from minor improvements to the Group's existing disclosures. Our response enabled the FRC to close its enquiries. The FRC review is limited to the 2022 Annual Report, and it does not benefit from detailed knowledge of our business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into. Accordingly the review and comments received from the FRC provide no assurance that the Annual Report is correct in all material respects.\n- \u00b7  Received presentations from the divisional Finance Directors of Latin America and Life Sciences which enabled the Committee to gain confidence in the depth of finance capability employed in the divisions as well as providing different perspectives and insights.\n\n## Governance (10%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's anti-bribery and fraud procedures, including those for whistleblowing. The Committee received a report on the independent investigations that had been conducted in response to concerns raised under the whistleblowing and fraud policies and was satisfied with the conclusions, including follow-up actions. The Committee also reviewed a summary of the controls in place to mitigate the risk of fraud in the Group, along with a bottom-up fraud risk assessment prepared by management. The Committee was satisfied that the ethics and fraud programmes were effective.\n- \u00b7  Undertook an external evaluation of the Committee's effectiveness. Information on the evaluation process can be found on page 89. The results of the review concluded that the Committee continued to be effective.\n- \u00b7  Compared its remit favourably with the FRC's recently published 'Minimum Standards for Audit Committees'.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Committee's terms of reference and confirmed that the role and responsibilities of the Committee are aligned with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Minor changes were made to confirm the Committee's assurance and monitoring role in relation to the Group's sustainability disclosures.\n- \u00b7  Undertook its annual legal and compliance review of the corporate governance and regulatory requirements of the Committee, concluding that it was in full compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and other corporate governance requirements.\n- \u00b7  Completed its annual review of the Group's tax compliance policy and risks relating thereto. No significant updates were required. The policy is available at www.croda.com.\n- \u00b7  Considered the impact of the retraction of UK corporate reform legislation on Croda's preparation for the expected changes to legislation:\n- -The Committee agreed that the work to enhance control design by standardising and leveraging automation should continue, as this would provide the benefit of improving visibility of control performance through consistent and accessible control evidence, which will be underpinned by the implementation of a new Integrated Risk Management system in 2024.\n\n- -Work will continue on scoping 'material information' in relation to sustainability reporting given its strategic importance to Croda to ensure that reported sustainability information is materially accurate. The scoping work around 'double materiality' (impact and financial materiality) is also required under upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) legislation.\n- -Even though the proposal for a Fraud Statement was withdrawn, given the introduction of legislation regarding 'failure to prevent fraud', work in this area will continue. See page 53 for details on what has been done in 2023.\n- -Although the Company will no longer need to publish an Audit Assurance Policy, the Committee believes it will be of value to Croda's risk management programme to produce a comprehensive assurance map, which will allow a better assessment of the level of assurance currently in place, and gauge the appetite for more or less assurance over specific risks.\n- -The proposal to publish a resilience statement was withdrawn. Given the continued requirement for the Company to publish long-term viability and going concern statements, the Committee agreed that publication of a resilience statement would not add additional value to Croda's stakeholders.\n- -Monitoring the introduction of the revised corporate reforms will continue to be a focus area for the Committee in 2024.\n\n## External audit (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Discussed and approved the external audit plan, including the assessment of significant audit risks; the engagement risk profile; the use of data analytics; the scope of the audit in terms of coverage, the materiality level and the de minimis reporting threshold; the co-ordination of external audits; and the key members of the engagement team. The Committee monitored the progress made by the statutory audit team against the agreed plan and discussed issues as they arose.\n- \u00b7  Discussed and approved the increase to the external audit fee. Information on the audit fees can be found in note 3 on page 166.\n- \u00b7  Agreed with the auditor that there should be sufficient focus on areas of particular concern to the Committee (e.g. the acquisition of Solus Biotech and carrying value of goodwill in respect of the Flavours CGU).\n- \u00b7  Reviewed in-depth a range of indicators to judge the overall audit quality as described in the auditor effectiveness considerations on page 104. Received a report from the Lead Audit Partner to ensure sustainable high levels of audit quality and the necessary prevailing culture amongst staff.\n- \u00b7  Met with the auditor without management present. The Committee considered the auditor's views. There were no significant issues to report.\n- \u00b7  Considered the independence and objectivity of the auditor. The Committee confirmed the independence of the auditor as further described on page 105.\n- \u00b7  Considered the effectiveness of the external audit process, concluding that the audit was effective (see page 104) and a recommendation was made to the Board on the re-appointment of KPMG as auditor at the AGM.\n\n## Internal audit and risk management (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the internal audit planning approach and its link to the Company's strategic objectives and priorities, reviewed reports on the work of the internal audit function from the VP Risk and Assurance and monitored compliance with the Group risk assurance programme. The Committee approved the internal audit plan and the implementation of any resulting actions by management.",

The Committee considered the adequacy of management's response to matters raised and challenged the timeliness in resolving such matters to ensure management was focused on prompt implementation of control improvements recommended by Internal Audit. The Committee requested that the internal audit team continued to monitor the completion rate.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the results of internal audits on General Computer Controls and Application Embedded Controls. The Committee considered the adequacy of the suggested action plan to address deficiencies identified at Iberchem, questioning the promptness in resolving these issues to ensure that management prioritises the timely implementation of control enhancements recommended by our co-source partner, PwC.\n- \u00b7  Discussed sustainability related non-financial KPIs and how the Audit Committee and the Board could obtain visibility about the processes and systems that underlie the KPI calculations. For more information see page 68.\n- \u00b7  Approved the appointment of KPMG as the external assurance partner to provide limited assurance of significant climate and gender diversity KPIs following a competitive tender process.\n- \u00b7  Received assessments of several significant capital expenditure projects against the Group's project guidelines, following up on areas requiring attention by the project teams as the projects progressed.\n- \u00b7  Continued to receive updates on IT security, particularly in relation to the Operations Technology control environment. The Chief Information Officer presented to the Committee to discuss strengths, weaknesses and action plans as well as the findings of third-party audits. The Committee received quarterly updates, including progress against agreed KPIs, and challenged management on the rate of progress on cyber security and asked management to consider ways of accelerating the work. For more information see the table below.\n- \u00b7  Assisted the Board in its assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks. The Committee assessed the results of the 2022 risk assurance activity carried out by internal audit and considered any additional key risks as a result of acquisitions during the year. The Committee reviewed and approved the 2023 internal audit plan and scope of the peer reviews.\n- \u00b7  Met with the internal auditors without management present. There were no significant issues identified.\n- \u00b7  Conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's internal audit function. The Committee concluded that the internal audit team, supported by PwC resource, was effective.\n- \u00b7  Received a presentation summarising the bottom-up fraud risk review undertaken during the year. This reinforced management's high-level risk assessment previously reported to the Committee which indicated that processes and controls were generally well designed to address fraud risks. See page 53 for more information.\n- \u00b7  Received a presentation on the Group's updated Business Continuity Plan framework and the planned risk based roll out approach.\n\n## Specific focus areas for 2023 (15%)\n\nIn addition to our core work, as set out in our terms of reference, we noted four specific focus areas for 2023, which absorbed the balance of the Committee's time.\n\n| Specific focus area                                                                                                        | Actions during the year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Progress                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain focus on cyber security  and the delivery of projects  identified in the information  security strategy           | Regular updates presented to the Committee on the execution of the Information Security  Programme and review of KPIs.

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## Looking ahead to 2024\n\nIn addition to our core business, the Committee has identified four focus areas for 2024. We will:\n\n- \u00b7  Maintain cyber security as a focus area for 2024 given it remains a principal risk.\n- \u00b7  Maintain focus on monitoring the impact of major business change programmes on Croda's risk and control environment.\n- \u00b7  Maintain UK corporate reform as a focus area for 2024 and monitor progress of relevant control framework changes.\n- \u00b7  Oversee the development of internal controls over the production and disclosure of non-financial information and oversee the provision of external assurance in respect of that information.\n\n## Internal audit and risk management\n\nI met with the VP Risk and Assurance several times during the year outside of the formal meetings to discuss the performance and output of the internal audit function and aspects of risk management. The VP Risk and Assurance attended each Committee meeting and presented an internal audit report that was reviewed and discussed fully, highlighting any major deviations from the annual plan agreed with the Committee.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee considered the results of the audits undertaken and the adequacy of management's response to matters raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. Particular focus was addressed to those areas where there was a major divergence between the outcome of the internal audit and the scoring of the self-assessment questionnaire, completed annually by each business unit. In these instances, the Committee challenged management as to what actions it was taking to minimise divergences arising in the future.\n\nIn January 2024, the Committee conducted its annual review of the internal audit function, including its approach to audit planning and risk assessment, communication within the business and with the Committee and its relationship with the external auditor. Senior management feedback from sites, included in the 2023 audit programme, is gathered by questionnaire to support this process. Details on how the business monitors risk and how it implements its risk management framework are set out on pages 51 to 53.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThrough the annual Board evaluation process, see page 89, the performance of the Committee was assessed and the output of the evaluation was considered by the Committee in January 2024.\n\nOverall, the evaluation concluded that the Committee was operating effectively and was efficiently led by an experienced Chair. The overall performance of the Committee and that of the Committee Chair were both highly rated. Members were well prepared for meetings and engaged in productive discussions with a healthy balance of support and constructive challenge for executives.\n\nRelationships between the Committee and Croda management were considered very effective. Senior leaders attended meetings as required which provided visibility into various business areas as well as the opportunity to strengthen relationships. Meetings were well run and adhered to a structured agenda and time frame with appropriate time allowed for more in-depth discussions when required.\n\nIt was recognised that with the establishment of the Sustainability Oversight Committee, there was a need for liaison between the two Committee Chairs to ensure no overlap. The review highlighted the opportunity to further diversify discussions to enhance consideration of external factors such as AI, geopolitical risks and the broader economic landscape.\n\n## External auditor's effectiveness\n\nDuring the year, the Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG as Group external auditor. To assist in the assessment, the Committee considered the quality of reports from KPMG and the additional insights provided by the audit team, particularly at partner level. It took account of the views of the CFO and Group Financial Controller, who had discussed subsidiary component audits with local audit partners, to gauge the quality of the team and knowledge and understanding of the business. The Committee also considered how well the auditor assessed key accounting and audit judgements and the way it applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the output from a questionnaire completed by senior members of the finance team to obtain their views on KPMG's effectiveness in carrying out the audit. The questionnaire covered:\n\n- \u00b7  Structure of the external audit team and their quality and approach.\n- \u00b7  The planning, delivery and execution of the audit.\n- \u00b7  The effectiveness of their reporting.\n- \u00b7  Effectiveness of communications between management and the audit team.\n- \u00b7  Robustness of the audit, including the independence of the external audit team and their ability to challenge management as well as demonstrate professional scepticism and independence.\n- \u00b7  The external audit team's judgement.\n\nScores were compared with previous years to understand trends and highlight areas of improvement. The independence, team size, seniority and expertise of the external audit team continued to be assessed positively. Examples included that the senior team had dealt with complex issues as they came up and were helpful in providing feedback on technical accounting and disclosure issues. Regional close-out meetings had been succinct and clear. Minor improvement areas were noted, which included the need for clearer upfront planning and effective communication on progress in some areas.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed a report produced by KPMG that summarised the internal measures that KPMG used to assess audit quality as well as responses to thematic areas identified by the FRC that were relevant to the Croda audit. And as mentioned above, the Committee received a report from the Lead Audit Partner on actions undertaken by KPMG to improve audit quality following the FRC report on the Carillion audit.\n\nThere were several quality interventions that attributed to the overall audit quality and ensured independent challenge. These included the use of specialists, audit consultations, a technical review, a second line inflight review and finally an independent audit partner review.",

        "page_content": "## External auditor's independence\n\nThe Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the objectivity of the Group's external auditor, KPMG, in reporting to shareholders. Our Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by external auditors, which is on our website www.croda.com, sets out permitted and prohibited non-audit services and the controls over assignments awarded to the external auditor to ensure that audit independence is not compromised and the provision of such services does not impair the external auditor's objectivity.\n\nIn 2023, non-audit fees were \u00a30.3m, significantly less than the total audit fees of \u00a32.8m; the non-audit to audit fees ratio stands at 0.1:1. The non-audit fees include the approved fees for carrying out a limited assurance of significant climate and gender diversity KPIs as noted earlier.\n\nThe Committee undertook its annual review of the Group's policies relating to external audit, including the policy that governs how and when employees and former employees of the Group's auditor can be employed by the Company. No changes were made. The Committee also reviewed and accepted KPMG's independence letter which annually confirms their independence and compliance with the FRC's ethical standard. In conclusion, the Committee agreed that KPMG were independent.\n\n## Significant financial statement reporting items\n\nThe Committee, with support from the external auditor, reviewed those items in the Group's and Parent Company's financial statements that have the potential to significantly impact reporting. These are set out below.\n\nGoodwill impairment: The strategy of the Group includes acquiring new technologies and businesses operating in adjacent markets. As a result, goodwill represents a significant asset value on the balance sheet of \u00a3937.9m out of total net assets of \u00a32,368.1m at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Committee completed its annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill, as prepared by management, including the detailed sensitivity analysis to a number of underlying assumptions, including the current macroeconomic outlook and the broader consequences on the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Committee assessed the methodologies used and the adequacy of the management disclosures. Particular attention was given to the SIPO cash generating unit's value in use model, which demonstrated a \u00a320.8m impairment versus its carrying value as lower forecast sales and margin have reduced its future value projection and the Flavours cash generating unit's value in use model based on its impairment in the prior year and low level of headroom. The Committee reviewed the methodology adopted to evaluate the risk of goodwill impairment. After challenge, the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions were reasonable and that no other impairments were necessary; however, enhanced disclosure was agreed to be appropriate for the Flavours cash generating unit, given the low headroom sensitivity of the calculations to certain assumptions.\n\nCroda is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. We undertook an audit tender in 2017 and the Board appointed KPMG as external auditor. The first year to be audited by KPMG was the year ended 31 December 2018. Subject to the continued quality and effectiveness of the current auditor, we plan to re-tender ahead of a 2028 appointment. The current Lead Audit Partner, Ian Griffiths, was appointed for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## External auditor reappointment\n\nAs noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that KPMG be offered for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. I will be available at the shareholder engagement event to respond to any questions shareholders may raise on the Committee's activities in the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Ramsay\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nPensions: The Committee monitored the Group's pension arrangements, in particular the funding of the defined benefit plan in the UK, which are sensitive to assumptions made in respect of discount rates, salary increases and inflation.\n\nThe Group engages external actuarial specialists. The Committee reviewed the actuarial assumptions used and compared them with those used by other companies. The external auditor also challenged the benchmark assumptions applied and conducted sensitivity analysis. Following their review, the Committee found the assumptions to be reasonable.\n\nParent Company's carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables: The Committee considered the carrying amount of the Parent Company's investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors, held at cost less impairment, representing 99% of the Parent Company's total assets (2022: 93%).\n\nThe recoverability of these balances is not considered judgemental; however, they are the most significant component of the Parent Company balance sheet and therefore require additional consideration as part of preparing the financial statements. This included comparing the carrying amount with the respective subsidiary's net asset value, profitability and cash generation. After review, the Committee was satisfied that the recoverability of these balances was acceptable, and no impairments were necessary.",

Chair's letter\n\nOn behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThis year has been a challenging year for the Group, with a weaker economic environment and customer destocking across consumer, crop and industrial markets impacting financial performance. Despite this, the Group continued to execute against the long-term growth strategy, driving sustainable innovation and continuing to invest in biotechnology, pharma expansion and capacity to support fast growth in Asia. We also took the opportunity to evolve our organisational structure, ensuring we are well positioned to capture future growth opportunities.\n\nAs a knowledge-based business, attracting, developing and retaining high-quality people throughout the organisation is key to our success. The Committee believes that an effective reward structure, as part of a wider employee engagement framework, plays a key role in the continued achievement of the Group's strategic objectives and in the delivery of sustainable, profitable growth.\n\nLast year we reviewed and updated our Remuneration Policy to ensure alignment with Croda's evolving ambition and were pleased to receive 94% votes in favour. The Remuneration Committee is not proposing any changes to the operation of the policy in 2024, being satisfied with the outcome of the review and operation of the policy in 2023, with reward outcomes aligned with the shareholder experience.\n\nAs Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank my colleagues for their commitment and engagement throughout the year and to welcome Chris Good as a new member of the Committee.\n\n## Remuneration out-turn for 2023\n\nWith a challenging trading environment in 2023, financial performance was weaker, with sales of \u00a31.7bn down by 19% and adjusted operating profit of \u00a3320m down by 38%. Despite this, execution against our strategy continued, ensuring we are positioned for sustainable growth over the long term.\n\nUnder our senior annual Bonus Plan the maximum opportunity for the CEO and CFO was 175% and 150% of base salary, respectively, based on profit performance (90% weighting) and an ESG metric (10% weighting). Consistent with the approach taken in prior years, bonusable profit was adjusted for the lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract. In 2023, however, profit performance was below the threshold with no annual bonus payable for this element of the award. For 2023 the ESG metric was based on safety. However, given the weakness of the overall financial performance of the Group, it was recommended by management and supported by the Committee that no annual bonus should be payable for 2023.\n\n2023 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2021 concluded their three-year cycle and the Committee reviewed performance against targets. Over the period, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance (35% weighting) was (23.5)%. This placed Croda below median when compared to our bespoke comparator group and this part of the award will not vest. Earnings per Share (EPS) growth over the period (35% weighting) was achieved at just above threshold at 5.6%. Consistent with last year, EPS was adjusted for the divestment of the majority of the PTIC business.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee overview\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe Committee determines and agrees with the Board the Company's Remuneration Policy and framework, ensuring that reward structures incentivise senior management appropriately, are aligned with Company strategy and promote the long-term success of the Company.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7  Determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Company's Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of senior management\n- \u00b7  Ensure that the remuneration framework is aligned with the Company's strategy and promotes the long-term success of the Company, appropriately incentivising senior management and the wider workforce\n- \u00b7  Review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture, taking these into account when setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors\n- \u00b7  Feedback to the Board on workforce reward, incentives and conditions in support of the Board's monitoring of whether the workforce policies and practices of the Company are aligned with its Purpose, values and strategy\n- \u00b7  Review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy\n- \u00b7  Establish the selection criteria, select, appoint and set the terms of reference for any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee and obtain reliable, up-to-date information about remuneration in other companies\n\nNew and Protected Products (NPP) growth (15% weighting) met the stretching vesting target, with NPP sales growing by 3.3 times non-NPP sales over the period and full vesting achieved for this element of the award. The 2021 PSP cycle included sustainability metrics (15% weighting), split equally between Climate Positive and Land Positive targets. The Climate Positive metric was a reduction in scope 1 emissions from a 2020 baseline of 102,750 MT. For 2023, Scope 1 emissions were 86,740 MT representing a 15.6% reduction against the baseline which results in 100% of this condition vesting. For the Land Positive element, the target was met, and full vesting was achieved.\n\nThe 2021 PSP award was subject to an Economic Value Added (EVA) underpin such that awards would be subject to a reduction (including potentially to nil) in the event that EVA had not improved over the three-year performance period. The EVA underpin was not met and the Committee therefore considered an appropriate reduction.\n\nAs part of these deliberations the Committee also took into account the Discretion Framework where a range of factors are considered to ensure payout is consistent with and reflective of overall performance over the period. One consideration made, as part of the Discretion Framework, was that the outturn against emissions targets had benefitted from the lower volumes in the year. More details of all the considerations taken into account are set out on page 122. Taking into account the EVA underpin alongside the Discretionary Framework the Committee determined that the overall vesting of the PSP would be reduced by 10%. The resultant overall PSP vesting was 37.1% of the total award.\n\n- \u00b7  Oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group.\n\nDetailed responsibilities are set out in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found at croda.com/en-gb/investors/ governance/board committees/remuneration-committee.\n\n## Specific focus areas in the year\n\n- \u00b7  Determine remuneration outcomes for 2023, including vesting of the 2021 PSP awards\n- \u00b7  Review of wider workforce remuneration including benefit structures\n- \u00b7  Setting appropriate targets for the senior annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan for 2024\n\n## Time allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n20%\n\n## Performance framework for 2024\n\nCroda's strategy continues to focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth by providing innovative and sustainable solutions to our customers. This is consistent with our Purpose, Smart science to improve lives TM , with our remuneration framework therefore underpinning our Purpose through performance measures and stretching targets.\n\nFor 2024, the senior annual Bonus Plan will continue to be based on a profit performance metric (90% of the total award) and an ESG metric (10% of the total award). The ESG metric was introduced into the senior annual Bonus Plan as part of the policy review in 2023 and the focus of this metric varies each year, adapting to our evolving priorities in this area. For 2024 the focus will continue to be based on safety, building on the work done in 2023 to support the embedding of SHE as a Value through the entire workforce.\n\nThe PSP performance framework is unchanged in substance and will continue to include EPS growth (35% of the award), relative TSR (35% of the award) and NPP and sustainability targets (30% of the award). The NPP element (15% of total award) incentivises innovation based on NPP revenue, being revenue from those products that will drive our future growth. Innovating sustainably is core to Croda's success, and we continue to focus management on the delivery of this. The sustainability element (15% of total award) will be focused on our 'Climate Positive' sustainability commitments, which for this award will include scope 3 emissions targets as well as competency-building on scope 3 through our organisation. It is only through continued innovation and collaboration, that we can reduce scope 3 emissions",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee report continued\n\nacross the full life cycle of our customers' products, and ultimately achieve our ambition to be 'Climate Positive'.\n\nIn line with normal practice, the Committee reviewed targets ahead of 2024. Targets for our senior annual Bonus Plan continue to be set using a consistent and distinctive framework, focused on year-on-year growth in Bonusable Profit. Bonusable Profit is an established performance measure at Croda, which has been used for many years and is focused on operational profitability based on Group EBITDA.\n\nFor the PSP award to be granted in 2024, the Committee considered share price performance over last year, recognising the impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment. Performance is always considered holistically; each year the Committee applies our comprehensive Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment of other measures of corporate performance. The Committee will review vesting outcomes against this Discretion Framework, with particular attention paid to share price performance to ensure Executive Directors do not benefit from any windfall gains. In addition to this we also have ROIC as an underpin in our PSP recognising that long-term ROIC performance continues to be a key focus for the business. The ROIC underpin, which is discretionary, has been revised for 2024 taking into account the current market environment. Safety also continues to be a specific underpin in our senior annual Bonus Plan.\n\n## Salaries for 2024\n\nFor 2024, there will be a general increase to salaries for UK employees of 3%. The Committee reviewed the salaries of our Executive Directors and determined that an increase of 3% would be awarded in line with that of the UK workforce.\n\n## Board changes\n\nDanuta Gray will join the Board with effect from 1 February 2024 and will succeed Anita as Chair at the conclusion of the Company's AGM on 24 April 2024. Anita Frew will then retire from the Board after nine years as Croda's Chair.\n\nIn anticipation of the appointment of a new Chair, the Committee instigated a review of the Chair fees recognising that in the nine years since Anita's appointment, Croda has grown in size and complexity to become an established FTSE 100 company. This review, which was supported by Deloitte, also included an extensive review of the market to consider what other similar sized organisations paid in order to attract the desired skills and experience to lead an increasingly diverse and international business. It was ultimately determined that the fee for the new Chair would be set at \u00a3425,000. The Committee also determined that it would be appropriate for this fee to apply for Anita, as the current Chair, from 1 January 2024 for the remainder of her tenure.\n\nLouisa Burdett, Chief Financial Officer, will leave Croda in June 2024 and the Board has commenced a search for her successor.\n\nRemuneration arrangements for Louisa Burdett have been managed in line with the Remuneration Policy and the proposed approach is in line with the approach that would be taken for other UK employees on giving notice. While Louisa remained eligible for an annual bonus for 2023, as discussed above, no annual bonus will be payable to all executives reflecting Croda's financial out-turn in the year. For 2024, she will receive a 3% salary increase, in line with the normal approach for UK employees that have given notice but will remain employed for part of the year, but will not be eligible for an annual bonus or PSP award. Further, all outstanding PSP awards will lapse.\n\n## Consideration of wider workforce and alignment of reward across the organisation\n\nOur approach to workforce reward forms an important part of Croda's philosophy and culture. One of the principles of Croda's culture is to drive 'One Croda', and therefore many of the remuneration structures\n\nthat apply to the Executive Directors also apply further in the global organisation. The key difference being that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership. Highlights of our approach to workforce pay include:\n\n- \u00b7  Our commitment to paying a Global Living Wage - in 2021 Croda established a Living Wage in each of the countries in which it operates and ensured that all employees receive this as a minimum. In 2023, we made progress in receiving certification from the Fair Wage Network (FWN), we expect to able to confirm this by the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n- \u00b7  Sharing of success with employees - achieved through the operation of various all-employee share plans, including our Free Share Plan which was introduced in 2021. We are pleased that workforce participation in these plans remains consistently strong year-on-year and allows our employees to become shareholders in the business.\n- \u00b7  Generous and inclusive benefits - our holistic health and wellbeing benefit offering, which was enhanced in response to the cost-ofliving crisis, is highly valued across the workforce. In addition, our CARE defined benefit pension, which applies across our entire UK workforce, is a generous and inclusive benefit.\n\nIn line with our 'One Croda' culture, our senior leaders all share the same performance metrics for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. Around 550 employees participate in the senior annual Bonus Plan and 65 of these are also in the PSP. We believe that this focuses our leadership on working together globally to deliver the best overall outcome for our customers and, in turn, our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nOver the last two years, we have established a regular engagement programme to gain insight from employees across the Group. Through surveys, listening groups, site visits and a dedicated email, all Croda colleagues can give their feedback directly so we can better understand how they are feeling about certain areas of business.\n\nThrough the Purpose and Sustainability Commitment (PSC) survey, we have gained valuable feedback on how changes to reward in each location and support offered with cost-of-living have been positively received, a direct impact of last year's Remuneration Committee review.\n\nWe were also happy to see that questions related to wellbeing and safety have seen an uplift in the number of positive responses, building on the great work to truly embed safety as a value in the organisation that has taken place in 2023.\n\nWe continue to operate a dedicated email address so that employees can send questions or comments direct to the Remuneration Committee Chair.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe remain confident that the Remuneration Policy that was approved in 2023 will continue to serve us well over the next two years and are not proposing any changes to its operation for 2024.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to seek out opportunities to further enhance the remuneration approach at Croda, considering advice from our investors and other stakeholders such as listening groups with our employees. We remain committed to ensuring that our remuneration framework reflects the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jacqui Ferguson\n\nRemuneration Committee Chair",

The Committee is committed to  providing open and transparent disclosure on executive remuneration for our stakeholders. Our arrangements are clearly disclosed and any changes to our Remuneration Policy and its operation are highlighted   in a way that defines their alignment to both our strategic ambitions as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate  Governance Code. |\n| Simplicity            | Our executive remuneration arrangements, as well as those throughout the global organisation, are simple in nature and  well understood by both participants and shareholders. Our senior annual Bonus Plan, in which around 550 of our global employees participate, is primarily based on a single   profit metric, with a simple key requirement that no bonus can be paid for this element until the previous year's profit                                         |\n| Risk                  | The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.  Performance is based on a balance of metrics which also reflect our broader stakeholders, for example inclusion of  sustainability targets and health and safety underpins. We then take a holistic assessment of performance using our  Discretion Framework.                                                                                      |\n|                       | Annual bonus deferral, the PSP holding period and our shareholding guidelines provide a clear link to the ongoing  performance of the business as well as alignment with shareholders. Executives will be rewarded for sustainable   long-term shareholder return.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Predictability        | Our Remuneration Policy contains details of maximum opportunity levels for each component of pay, with actual incentive  outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Proportionality       | Our Remuneration Policy directly aligns to our strategy and financial performance. The Committee considers performance  from a range of perspectives. Poor financial performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Alignment  to culture | Alignment to our 'One Croda' culture is clearly established in our Remuneration Policy. Our senior annual Bonus Plan has  the same metrics for all participants. Our PSP metrics, and from 2023 our senior annual Bonus Plan ESG metric, reflect our  commitment to sustainability. Pensions are also aligned across the workforce.                                                                                                                                     |",

We believe it is important to our culture and our values to have an active dialogue with employees on topics such as reward, recognition, motivation, wellbeing, safety, and inclusion. A summary of engagement activities undertaken to date is as follows:\n\nReward principles\n\nOur reward principles, which were developed and approved during 2019, guide the way we recognise and remunerate all our global employees. These principles focus on total reward including intangible rewards and were strongly influenced by the results of our previous Global Employee Survey. These have been shared across the organisation.\n\nEmployee pulse surveys\n\nIn 2023 a number of pulse surveys covering a range of topics, including culture and reward, were undertaken and findings were shared with the Board, management and employees to help guide decisions.\n\nListening groups\n\nDuring 2023 the Chair of the Board and other Non-Executive Directors attended listening groups to better understand how employees felt on a range of different topics, including reward.\n\nDedicated email to Chair of Committee\n\nA dedicated email address has been established for employees to send comments or questions to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nOverview of pay and policy decisions\n\nCommittee members are updated annually on global employees' terms and conditions and are made aware of any significant changes to policies and other pay-related matters.",

Annually, the President Human Resources provides the Committee with a review of workforce remuneration, and the Committee is updated periodically on any feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.\n\nOne of the principles of Croda's culture is to drive 'One Croda', therefore, many of the remuneration structures that apply to Executives also apply further in the global organisation, as set out in the table below. The key difference between the policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees is that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership.\n\n| Remuneration element         | Who participates?                                                                                         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salary                  | All employees                                                                                             | Pay is set in line with the market and closely monitored.

        "page_content": "## Sharing success across the business\n\nThe Committee believes in sharing success across the business and extending share ownership more widely across our employee base. This is promoted through the operation of our 'Free Share Plan' and a number of all-employee share schemes.\n\n## Free Share Plan\n\nIn 2021 we launched the 'Free Share Plan'. Under this new plan, all employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus Plan are gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior annual Bonus Plan pays out. Unlike other elements of remuneration this award is not set as a multiple of salary, instead it rewards all eligible employees at the same value.\n\nThe Free Share Plan was developed in response to findings from the Global Reward Survey in 2020 and aims to share success more widely across the business and encourage share ownership.\n\nAs the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out for 2023, no award was made under the Free Share Plan.\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nWorkforce participation in these plans has remained consistently strong and is driven by our culture of employees feeling a strong loyalty to the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Living Wage\n\nWe were pleased to announce in 2018 that we gained accreditation in the UK as a Living Wage Employer from the Living Wage Foundation. In 2024, we will continue to ensure that all our UK employees and regular contractors are paid at, or above, the rates advised by the Living Wage Foundation.\n\nIn addition, the business continues to pursue its Global Living Wage target, one of our sustainability KPIs linked to the UN SDGs. In 2020 we forged a partnership with the Fair Wage Network (FWN) to establish, using an independent and economically rigorous methodology, Living Wage levels across the world. In 2021, we compared our global wage levels to Living Wage comparators provided by the FWN and made all necessary adjustments to ensure that all our employees are now paid a Living Wage at a minimum.\n\nWe reviewed our Living Wage levels in 2023 and made any adjustments necessary in order to continue paying a Living Wage to all employees. Through 2023 we made good progress in gaining accreditation for our work from the Fair Wage Network and expect to be able to confirm this by the end of the first quarter of 2024. In 2022 we also began the process of ensuring all our regular contractors are paid a Living Wage and plan to achieve this milestone by the end of 2024.\n\n## More than just pay\n\nOur employees and our culture remain central to the continued success of Croda. We have continued to enhance our offering of activities available to employees, including:\n\n- \u00b7  We are proud of the training and development that we provide for employees and have set a target of ensuring all employees receive at least one week of training a year by the end of 2025. In 2023, our employees undertook over 197,000 hours of training with the average number of hours an employee completed being 34 hours.\n- \u00b7  In 2021 we relaunched and redesigned our core company development programmes for senior leaders and future leaders with our values at their heart. 2023 was the second year many of these programmes were able to run and all programmes have been positively received by employees.\n- \u00b7  In 2021 we also launched an inclusion-based global leadership programme, Phoenix Rising. In 2023, we invited a third cohort to begin this programme, with participants joining from all over the world, and invited the participants from 2021 and 2022 cohorts to meet at a week-long 'Phoenix Rising Unites' learning event. We also ran a series of leadership webinars on diversity & inclusive leadership.\n- \u00b7  Each of our sites is tasked with ensuring at least four health and wellbeing events are run per year, with many sites running significantly more than this. We also continued with Employee Assistance Programmes in many of our countries.\n\nSee pages 16 & 17 for further information on our culture including details on how we approach the recruitment, development and training of our workforce.",

Addressing this issue will require a long-term approach but we have already begun work to increase the number of females working in production and in senior positions.\n\nOver 2023 42% of hires and promotions to leadership positions were female, with the number of women in leadership positions now at 39% (2022: 38%).\n\nOther actions taken to address the gender pay gap include:\n\n- \u00b7  Ensuring balanced shortlists for all appointments where possible with a target of having 80% of shortlists gender balanced.\n- \u00b7  Further improving our talent and succession planning processes to help identify and nurture talent early in their career.\n- \u00b7  Ensuring that our global talent development programmes continue to have a gender-balanced mix of participants.\n- \u00b7  Supporting female leaders in their development, offering attendance on programmes such as Solaris, a women's executive leadership development programme for women specifically of Black heritage.\n- \u00b7  Finding ways to reduce shift work (especially night work) and to examine the feasibility of part-time and job share arrangements in our production facilities.\n- \u00b7  Continuing to invest in our STEM activities to encourage a wide range of applicants to apply for roles in our business.\n\nMore information is available on the Croda website.",

The pay ratios are calculated on a Group-wide basis by reference to UK employees only.\n\nUnder the regulations, there are three methodologies that companies can choose to report their pay ratio, known as Option A, B and C. For 2023 we have chosen to continue to use the Government's preferred option, Option A. Using this methodology, we have determined the full-time equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees and have ranked this data to identify employees whose remuneration places them at the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile. The pay ratios are then calculated by comparing total remuneration for these three employees against our CEO 'single figure' total remuneration.\n\n|           | Methodology   | 25 th  percentile   | 50 th  percentile   | 75 th  percentile   |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| FY 2023   | A             | 36:1                | 27:1                | 22:1                |\n| FY 2022*  | A             | 121:1               | 90:1                | 73:1                |\n| FY 2021   | A             | 103:1               | 81:1                | 67:1                |\n| FY 2020   | A             | 48:1                | 37:1                | 31:1                |\n| FY 2019   | A             | 57:1                | 44:1                | 37:1                |\n| FY 2018** | C             | 85:1                | 67:1                | 57:1                |\n\n- 6.  New starters, part-time employees and employees on long-term sick and maternity are included; their salary has been amended to reflect a full-time and full-year salary.\n- * The ratio for 2022 has been restated. This is to reflect the updated CEO 'single figure' total remuneration for 2022, which was due to the 2022 PSP award being updated to reflect the actual share price at vesting. Where relevant PSP calculations for the workforce have also been updated on the same basis. Annual bonus amounts for the workforce have also been updated to reflect the actual amounts paid in March 2023.\n\n## Employee total remuneration\n\n|                   | Actual base salary  2023   | Total remuneration  2023   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 75 th  percentile | \u00a354,791                    | \u00a361,142                    |\n| 50 th  percentile | \u00a347,718                    | \u00a349,357                    |\n| 25 th  percentile | \u00a335,714                    | \u00a337,490                    |\n\nThe CEO pay ratio is calculated based on the total remuneration payable to the CEO, which could include payments under the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. The outcomes of these elements are directly linked to performance, with the value of the PSP also incorporating share price growth. It is therefore expected that the ratios will fluctuate significantly year-on-year to reflect Croda's performance. In respect of the 2023 figures, as the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out and the PSP has paid out at a lower level, from 100% in 2022 to 37.1% in 2023, the ratio has decreased significantly.",

This pro-rated amount is included in the table above.\n- 2.  Benefits include company car or cash allowance, private medical insurance and private fuel and travel allowances.\n- 3.  This represents the 20% of salary supplement.\n- 4.  A. The PSP awards granted in March 2021 reached the end of their performance period on 31 December 2023. The awards will vest at 37.1% of maximum (see page 122). The values included in the table above are based on the three-month average price to 31 December 2023 of 4582.6p. This is 27.1% lower than the share price at grant, and therefore no value is attributable to share price growth.

In line with our well established practice, profit targets were set based on the amount by which the profit for the year exceeded the profit for 2022 (the 'Bonusable Profit'). Bonusable Profit is focused on operational profitability based on Group EBITDA, and, consistent with last year, was adjusted for the divestment of our PTIC business and the lipid system sales for our principal Covid-19 vaccine contract.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Threshold  target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Maximum  target   | Actual outcome (%  of maximum)                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bonusable Profit  (90% weighting)                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \u00a3444.3m                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \u00a3488.8m           | \u00a3341.1m 0%                                                                                              |\n| ESG metric  (10% weighting)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Safety measure in relation to the whole population of eligible employees, and the extent  to which the population:                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                   | Safety training  completed by 98% of  eligible employees.

Koninklijke DSM has been excluded following delisting in May 2023.\n\nThe PSP awards granted in March 2021 were subject to an EVA underpin such that an improvement in EVA over the three-year PSP performance period was required. In circumstances where the underpin is not achieved, the underpin operates such that the Committee considers an appropriate reduction (including to nil) to the vesting of awards. In certain circumstances, the Committee retains the right not to apply discretion.\n\nThe EVA in respect of 2023 did not exceed EVA in 2020 (the year prior to the start of the performance period). The Committee therefore considered the level of reduction to apply to the PSP vesting outcome.\n\nIn relation to the EVA underpin, the Committee took into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Consideration of the various factors which had impacted EVA performance over the period, which included both business performance as well as external factors such as market challenges, interest rate increases and their impact on the notional cost of capital in the EVA calculation.\n- \u00b7  The degree to which the overall PSP vesting outcome had already been impacted, in particular through the TSR and EPS metrics which align to shareholder value and profitability. The TSR outcome was zero, and the Adjusted EPS outcome was at threshold. These measures together comprised 70% of the award, and therefore overall vesting had already been significantly impacted by the downturn in performance in the final year of the performance period.\n\n- \u00b7  That on an aggregate basis, EVA over the performance period was significantly positive.\n\nAs part of its deliberations the Committee also took into account the Discretion Framework where a range of factors are considered to ensure payout is consistent with and reflective of overall performance over the period. Our PSP performance framework includes consideration of both financial performance, as well as innovation and sustainability, which are key drivers to Croda's long term strategic success. The Committee noted the strong performance in innovation via NPP performance, and in relation to sustainability, the land savings, and the specific actions that have contributed to a reduction in our Scope 1 emissions. However the Committee also recognised that the outturn against the emissions targets had benefitted from the lower volumes in the year.\n\nTaking into account both the EVA underpin and the Discretion Framework, it was considered that a downwards adjustment of 10% was appropriate, reducing the overall PSP vesting outcome from 41.2% to 37.1%.\n\nOverall, considering the adjustments to both the annual bonus and PSP out-turns, the Committee is satisfied that incentive outcomes are reflective of overall performance.\n\nThe forecast vesting value of the awards made in March 2021 is included in the 2023 single figure table on page 120. Any shares vesting will be subject to a two-year holding period.",

The first grant of 225% and 175% of salary for Steve Foots and Louisa Burdett, respectively, was made on 17 March 2023 at the same time as awards for other employees. Following the approval of the Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2023 AGM, which included an increase to the maximum PSP of 25% of base salary for both Steve Foots and Louisa Burdett a further grant of 25% of salary was made on 2 May 2023.\n\nThe 2023 PSP awards are subject to a performance condition which is split into three parts: 35% EPS, 35% TSR, and 30% sustainability metrics, including NPP. Performance targets were disclosed in full last year, see page 112 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2022. Vesting will take place on a sliding scale. A ROIC underpin applies across the entire award, also detailed on page 112 of our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.\n\nAny shares vesting will be subject to a two-year holding period.\n\nJez Maiden retired in 2023 and as such was not granted a PSP award for 2023. Louisa Burdett will forfeit this award considering her resignation.\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nExecutive Directors are invited to participate in the HMRC tax-approved UK Sharesave Scheme and the Croda Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in line with, and on the same terms as, the wider UK workforce.\n\n## SIP\n\nDetails of shares purchased and awarded to Executive Directors under the SIP are shown in the table below.

Jez Maiden was not eligible to remain in the SIP after his retirement and therefore holding at the end of 2023 was nil. As Louisa Burdett had under one year of service through 2023 she was not eligible to participate in the SIP.",

Pension entitlements for Executive Directors are tailored to local market practice, length of service and the participant's age. In 2016, a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) scheme was introduced with a cap applied to pension benefits; at this time the cap was set at \u00a365,000. The cap is increased each year in line with inflation, and from April 2024 will be \u00a380,445. Employees who earn in excess of the pension cap or who cannot be members of the plan due to tax limitations receive a pension supplement. For Executive Directors this supplement is up to 20% of salary in line with the wider UK workforce.\n\n## Steve Foots' historic pension provision\n\nSteve Foots was a member of the Croda Pension Scheme up to 31 January 2021. Steve Foots accrued pension benefits under the Croda Pension Scheme up to this date with a CARE accrual rate of 1/60 th and an entitlement to retire at age 60. From 6 April 2011 onwards, pension benefits accruing were based on a capped salary. This cap was \u00a3187,500 until April 2014 at which point it reduced to \u00a3150,000, and due to annual allowance regulations and changes to the pension scheme, reduced to \u00a337,500 in April 2016 (reduced from the scheme cap of \u00a365,650 due to annual allowance regulations) and reduced again in April 2020 to \u00a315,000 following new annual allowance regulations. If Steve Foots retires before the age of 60, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, unless he is retiring at the Company's request. In the event of death, a pension equal to two thirds of the Director's pension would become payable to the surviving spouse. Steve Foots' pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum for benefits accrued before 6 April 2006, and in line with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued from 6 April 2006 onwards.\n\nSteve Foots is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy. Steve Foots elected to opt out of the Croda Pension Scheme from 31 January 2021 and therefore only now receives a pension supplement of 20% of salary.\n\n## Louisa Burdett's pension provision\n\nLouisa Burdett elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2023. She is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.\n\n## Jez Maiden's pension provision\n\nJez Maiden elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2023. He was entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.",

Other Executive Director: 150% of salary.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, and only in connection with recruitment, annual awards may be made up to 200% of salary. This maximum does not apply to the incumbent Executive Directors at the time the Policy is approved.\n\n- \u00b7  The majority of the bonus will typically be based on challenging financial targets set in line with the Group's KPIs (for example profit growth targets).\n- \u00b7  For a minority of the bonus, targets related to other Group measures, such as sustainability, may be included where this is considered appropriate by the Committee.\n- \u00b7  For a profit measure, bonus normally starts to accrue once the threshold target is met, from 0% payable rising on a graduated scale to 100% for outperformance. Were an additional financial KPI metric to be introduced, the amount payable for threshold performance would not exceed 25% of maximum.\n- \u00b7  In relation to any sustainability measure, the structure of the target will vary based on the nature of the target set.\n- \u00b7  The Committee applies a Discretion Framework, which includes health, safety and environmental performance, when determining the actual overall level of individual bonus payments and it may adjust the bonus awards (including potentially reducing to zero) if it considers it appropriate to do so.\n- \u00b7  Bonuses paid are subject to provisions that enable the Committee to recover value overpaid through the withholding of variable pay previously earned or granted (malus) or through requesting a payment from an individual (clawback) in the event of a misstatement of results, an error in assessing the performance conditions, serious misconduct, serious reputational damage or material corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a three-year period following the date on which the bonus is paid.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nPages 70 to 138 inclusive, together with the sections of the Annual Report and Accounts incorporated by reference, constitute a Directors' Report that has been drawn up and presented in accordance with applicable English company law; the liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report are subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by that law.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development activities are undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Directors are recommending a final dividend of 62.0p per share (2022: 61.0p). If approved by shareholders, total dividends for the year will amount to 109.0p per share (2022: 108.0p). Details of dividends are shown in note 8 on page 169; details of the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan can be found on page 204. The Company has established various Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) in connection with the obligation to satisfy future share awards under employee share incentive schemes. The trustees of the EBTs have waived their rights to receive dividends on certain Ordinary Shares of the Company held in the EBTs. Such waivers represent less than 1% of the total dividend payable on the Company's Ordinary Shares. Further details of the EBTs can be found in note 24 on page 193.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association (Articles) give the Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. The present Directors of the Company are shown on pages 72 to 73.\n\nIn line with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, each Director will be standing for election or re-election at the AGM, with the exception of Anita Frew who will retire at the AGM. Details of the Directors' service contracts are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 127 to 128.\n\nApart from the share option schemes, long-term incentive schemes and service contracts, no Director had any beneficial interest in any contract to which the Company or a subsidiary was a party during the year. A statement indicating the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company, including share options, is shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 125.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for managing the business of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, the Company's Articles and any directions given by special resolution.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Company maintains Directors' and Officers' liability insurance that gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against its Directors. The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its Directors, members of the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary, which represent 'qualifying third party indemnity provisions' (as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006), in relation to certain losses and liabilities that the Directors, Executive Committee members or Company Secretary may incur to third parties in the course of acting as Directors or the Company Secretary or as employees of the Company or of any associated company. In addition, such indemnities have been granted to other officers of the Company who are Directors of subsidiary companies within the Group. Such indemnities were in place during 2023 and at the date of approval of the Group financial statements.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAt the date of this report, 142,536,884 Ordinary Shares of 10.609756p each have been issued and are fully paid up and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. At the date of this Report, the Company has issued and fully paid up 21,900 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares, 498,434 6.6% Cumulative Preference Shares and 615,562 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares, all of \u00a31 each (the Preference Shares). The rights and obligations attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles are available on the Company's website www.croda.com or copies can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares or on the transfer of securities in the Company. The 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than 12 calendar months in arrears. The 6.6% and 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company, unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than six calendar months in arrears or the business of the general meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for reducing the share capital of the Company, to sell the undertaking of the Company or to alter the Articles. No person holds securities in the Company that carry special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.\n\n## Power to issue or buy back shares\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued shares in the Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to approximately one third of the issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, for general purposes, plus up to a further one third of the Company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, but only in the case of a rights issue.\n\nA further special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Both of these authorities expire on the date of the 2024 AGM, that is 24 April 2024, and so the Directors propose to renew them for a further year.",

Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving\n\nour view of\n\nrisks\n\n## Audit Committee interaction\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee ('AC') met five times. KPMG are invited to attend all AC meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the AC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the AC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each. The matters included in the Audit Committee Chair's report on pages 100 to 105 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## Materiality (item 6 below)\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement. We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at \u00a316m (FY22: \u00a318m) and for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole at \u00a38.7m (FY22: \u00a38.7m).\n\n2023\n\nConsistent with FY22, we determined that Group profit before tax from continuing operations ('PBT') normalised for goodwill impairment, and restructuring costs, remains the benchmark for the Group as the Group is a profit-making trading business. As such, we based our Group materiality on normalised PBT, of which it represents 4.7% (FY22: 4.7%).\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.3%).\n\n## Materiality levels used in our audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup\n\nGroup Materiality\n\nGPM\n\nGroup Performance Materiality\n\nHCM\n\nHighest Component Materiality\n\nPLC\n\nParent Company Materiality\n\nLCM\n\nLowest Component Materiality\n\nAMPT\n\nAudit Misstatement Posting Threshold\n\nWe have not performed any non-audit services during FY23 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 6 financial years ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. As these are the third set of the Group's financial statements signed by Ian Griffiths, he will be required to rotate off after the FY25 audit.\n\nThe average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is 2.7 years, with the shortest being 1 and the longest being 6.\n\n| Total audit fee                                              | \u00a32.5m         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Audit related fees   (including interim review)              | \u00a30.3m         |\n| Other services                                               | \u00a30.001m       |\n| Non-audit fee as a % of total  audit and audit related fee % | 12%           |\n| Date first appointed                                         | 25 April 2018 |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                                   | 6 years       |\n| Next financial period   which requires a tender              | 2028          |\n| Tenure of Group engagement  partner                          | 3 years       |\n| Average tenure of component  signing partners                | 2.7 years     |\n\nOur risk assessment considers the Group's operations, the macro-economic environment and other relevant external factors which impact the results of the Group. Having considered these external factors, we have identified the below key audit matters.\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Flavours goodwill is sensitive to changes in key assumptions. There is limited headroom in the model and therefore the recoverable amount of goodwill in the Flavours CGU continues to be a key audit matter, however the level of risk has reduced compared to FY22 as a result of the impairment recognised the prior year. We have identified the valuation of the Flavours Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to be a significant risk of error.\n\nWe have identified the valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities as a key audit matter given the scheme remains open to future accrual and new members, and due to the significant estimation uncertainty with regards to key assumptions used for determining the valuation of gross defined benefit liabilities.\n\nThe sensitivity of the estimation is heightened when there is volatility in the macroeconomic conditions, as currently experienced in the UK in FY22 and FY23. Following the divestment of the PTIC ('Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals') businesses in FY22, the key focus for the Parent Company audit is the recoverability of the shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings given they represent a significant portion of the Company's\n\nassets; accordingly this has been reinstated as a key audit matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Key Audit Matters ('KAM')                                                                    | Vs  FY22    | Item        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Flavours goodwill impairment                                                                 |             | 4.1         |\n| Valuation of UK defined benefit  pension scheme liabilities                                  |             | 4.2         |\n| Recoverability of Parent  Company's shares in Group  undertakings and amounts  owed by Group |             | 4.3         |\n| Key                                                                                          | Key         | Key         |\n| Decrease in                                                                                  | Decrease in | Decrease in |",

The Group is monitoring Climate Positive targets and Science Based Targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00baC by 2030, and to be climate net zero by 2050. Climate change initiatives impact the Group in a variety of ways including opportunities and risks relating to bio-based raw material supply, operational and supply chain decarbonisation and emerging regulatory requirements such as carbon taxes. Further information is provided on pages 59 to 67.\n\nThe Group considered the impact of climate change and the Group's targets in the preparation of the financial statements, including an evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements. The Group concluded that this did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, as described on pages 157 and 158.\n\nWe performed a risk assessment, taking into account climate change risks and commitments made by the Group, considering how climate change may impact the financial statements and our audit. This included enquiries of management, consideration of the Group's processes for assessing the potential impact of climate change risk on the consolidated financial statements and assessing the TCFD scenario analysis performed by the Group, including their assessment of critical accounting estimates and judgements, and the effect on our audit. Our risk assessment considered in particular the potential impact on the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the estimates made regarding useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, going concern and the valuation of certain unquoted pension assets.\n\nWe held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nBased on our risk assessment we determined that the climate related risks to the Group's business, strategy and financial planning do not have a significant impact on balances in the consolidated financial statements or on our key audit matters. We have read the Group's disclosure of climate related information in the front half of the Annual Report as set out on pages 98 and 99, and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period (going concern is considered 12 months from approval of the financial statements). The Group issued two profit warnings in 2023 to announce the reduction in its expected profit before tax at year end. The reduced profits were driven by customer destocking activities which were unprecedented as set out in the Strategic Report on page 19. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period was:\n\n- \u00b7 Further customer destocking and weaker demand could have an adverse impact on the Group's future cashflows, forecasts and overall profitability, as seen through 2023\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as regulatory incidents, site incidents and impact of product quality issues leading to a product recall or loss of revenue which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources. compliance in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption Group's current and projected cash and facilities (a reverse stress test). We also assessed\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the the completeness of the going concern disclosure on page 157.\n\nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u00b7 We consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement on page 157 of the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 157 to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 138 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency\n\nbetween the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge. Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in\n\nrelation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors' confirmation within the long-term viability statement on page 58 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 the Directors' explanation in the long-term viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the long-term viability statement set out on page 58 under the Listing Rules.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability.\n\n2023\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in\n\nrelation to these disclosures. materially consistent with the financial statements\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are and our audit knowledge.",

The financial statements (note 12) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing methodology: we obtained the discounted value in use cash flow model and assessed the methodology, principles and integrity of the model.\n- \u00b7\n- Our valuation expertise: we involved our own valuation specialists to assist us in challenging the appropriateness of the discount rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the Group's forecast assumptions for cash flow projections, including the rate of sales growth and gross profit growth in the short to medium term, with reference to internally and externally derived sources.\n- \u00b7 Historical comparisons: we assessed the Group's historical forecasting accuracy by comparing forecasts from prior years with actual results in those years.\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: we performed breakeven analysis on the key assumptions including revenue and gross margin. We also performed breakeven analysis on other assumptions such as discount rate and long-term growth rates.\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: we considered the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of impairment testing and whether disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions properly reflect the risks inherent in the valuations of goodwill.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our approach to the audit of the recoverable amount of the Flavours goodwill, including our planned substantive procedures, the involvement of our valuation specialists and the extent of our control reliance.\n- \u00b7 Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodology, key assumptions used and conclusion of no impairment to be recorded.\n- \u00b7 The adequacy of the disclosures, particularly as they relate to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the area of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7 The appropriateness of the model, and in particular key assumptions used in the model including revenue and cost of sales growth rates and other assumptions such as discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\n## Our results\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Group's conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill to be acceptable (FY22: We found the goodwill balance, and the related impairment charge, to be acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 105 for details on how the Audit Committee considered this Key Audit Matter as an area of significant attention, page 159 for the accounting policy, and note 12 for the financial disclosures.",

The UK scheme is also open to future accrual and new members, and small changes in the assumptions and estimates with respect to the liabilities may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group engages external actuarial specialists to assist them in selecting appropriate assumptions and in calculating the liabilities.\n- \u00b7 The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of the defined benefit liabilities has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged the key assumptions applied in the calculation of the liabilities including the discount rate, inflation rate, and mortality with the support of our own actuarial specialists to compare the key assumptions against market data.\n- \u00b7 Actuary's credentials: we assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the Group's actuarial expert.\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis : we assessed the sensitivity of the defined benefit liabilities to changes in key assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: we considered adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the gross liabilities to changes in key assumptions.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\nThe financial statements (note 11) disclose the sensitivity of the liabilities to key assumptions estimated by the Group.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our approach to the audit of UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities, including the use of our actuarial specialists.\n- \u00b7 Our conclusions on testing the valuation of the defined benefit liabilities and the adequacy of the disclosures.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u00b7 The appropriateness of the valuation of UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities and in particular, the selection of key assumptions used in the valuation (the discount rate, the inflation rate and the mortality).\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the valuation of the pension liabilities to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 105 for details on how the Audit Committee considered this Key Audit Matter as an area of significant attention, page 160 for the accounting policy, and note 11 for the financial disclosures.\n\n2023",

However, due to their materiality in the context of the Parent Company financial statements as a whole, these are considered to be the area which had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our Company audit.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: we compared the carrying amount of 100% of the Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings with the relevant subsidiaries' draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of the carrying amount of those shares and assessed whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\n- \u00b7 Assessing subsidiary audits: we assessed the work performed by the subsidiary audit team on all of those subsidiaries, and considered the results of that work, on those subsidiaries' profits and net assets, and the likely risk of default on the intra-group balance.\n- \u00b7 Test of detail: For each intra-group debtor counterparty, we evaluated the likely risk of default with reference to the Company's definition of default and those subsidiaries' performance against budgets and forecasts of future profitability.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Parent Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Communications with the Croda International Plc Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our approach to the audit of the recoverability of the Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings including details of our planned substantive procedures.\n- \u00b7 Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the carrying value of the Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe do not consider this KAM to have any significant judgement or estimation involved.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the Parent Company's conclusion that there is no impairment of its shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings to be acceptable (FY22 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit Committee Report on page 105 for details on how the Audit Committee considered the recoverability of Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings as an area of significant attention, pages 162 and 197 for the accounting policy on the recoverability of the Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings, and notes F and G for the financial disclosures.\n\n## Changes to key audit matters\n\n## Divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses (Group and Parent Company)\n\nThe Group disposed of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses ('PTIC') in FY22 and this was identified as a key audit matter for FY22. However, there are no such events taking place in current year and therefore this is no longer identified as a key audit matter. We have instead reinstated the key audit matter over the recoverability of the Parent Company's shares in Group undertakings and amounts owed by Group undertakings as post the divestment of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses, the main area of audit effort has switched from the divestment accounting to the recoverability assessment.\n\n## Recoverable amount of the Fragrances goodwill\n\nWe continue to perform audit procedures over the recoverable amount of the Fragrances goodwill, however, the risk in this area has reduced such that we no longer consider this to be a key audit matter.

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to  enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is  from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures  required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non- detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override   of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for  preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.                                                                                                                                                  |",

We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n\u00a316m (FY22: \u00a318m) Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole\n\n## \u00a312m (FY22: \u00a313.5m) Performance materiality\n\n## \u00a30.8m (FY22: \u00a30.9m) Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a316m (FY22: \u00a318m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised Group profit before tax from continuing operations ('PBT') of which it represents 4.7% (FY22: 4.7%).\n\nConsistent with FY22, we determined that Group normalised PBT remains the main benchmark for the Group because it is the metric in the primary statements which best reflects the focus of the financial statements' users. Also profit is directly linked to shareholder returns, therefore the users of financial statements are focused on profit based measures as this is the primary measure communicated to investors, in both short-term guidance and in financial reporting. We have normalised by adding back adjustments that did not represent the normal continuing operations of the Group, being goodwill impairment arising on the acquisition of Sipo (\u00a320.8m) discussed in note 12 and restructuring costs (\u00a35.4m) discussed in note 21 (FY22 were exceptional PTIC gain, goodwill impairment and property, plant and equipment impairment), and we have averaged over five years (FY22: three years). We note that there has been a positive impact of Covid on the Group in 2021 and 2022 coupled with more usual levels of profit in 2020 and 2019, we therefore consider five years to be the more appropriate time period to normalise. Our Group materiality of \u00a316m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised PBT. When using a benchmark of normalised PBT to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.7% (FY22: 4.7%) to the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a38.7m (FY22: \u00a38.7m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (FY22: 0.3%).\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nThe Parent Company performance materiality was set at \u00a36.5m (FY22: \u00a36.5m), which equates to 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Croda International Plc's Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied\n\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u00a316m (FY22: \u00a318m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:\n\n|                                   | Total Group revenue   | Total Group revenue   | Group profit before tax   | Group profit before tax   | Total Group assets   | Total Group assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                   | FY23                  | FY22                  | FY23                      | FY22                      | FY23                 | FY22                 |\n| Financial statement caption       | \u00a31,694.5m             | \u00a32,089.3m             | \u00a3236.3m                   | \u00a3780.0m                   | \u00a33,579.2m            | \u00a33,611.9m            |\n| Group materiality as % of caption | 0.9%                  | 0.9%                  | 6.8%                      | 2.3%                      | 0.4%                 | 0.5%                 |\n\n2023",

        "page_content": "## 7. The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## Group audit team oversight\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group has 86 reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 5% (FY22: 5%) of total assets or 10% (FY22: 10%) of total revenue or 10% (FY22: 10%) of Group profit before tax. We selected total assets, total revenue, and profit before tax because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 4 (FY22: 5) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components. In addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the Group financial statements as a whole, we selected 10 (FY22: 10) components on which to perform audit procedures. Of these components, we performed full scope audits for 4 components (FY22: 6), performed audits of account balances e.g., revenue and cash, on 5 components (FY22: 4) and only cash on 1 component (FY22: nil) and performed analytical procedures on the remaining 72 components (FY22: 73). The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated in section 2 - Group Scope.\n\n| Scope                      | Number of components   | Range of materiality applied   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Full scope audit           | 8 (11)                 | \u00a32.7m - \u00a38.8m (\u00a31.8m - \u00a39.9m)  |\n| Specified audit procedures | 6 (4)                  | \u00a31.6m - \u00a32.7m (\u00a31.8m - \u00a32.7m)  |\n\nDuring FY23, we scoped out Croda Singapore and Croda Italy and reduced the scope for Croda Japan from full scope audit to specified procedures due to the decrease in relative significance of these components to the Group. Further, during FY23, we scoped in Croda Denmark for specified audit procedures to ensure appropriate overall coverage of the Group. The remaining 26% (FY22: 22%) of total Group revenue, 17% (FY22: 13%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax and 19% (FY22: 17%) of total Group assets is represented by 72 (FY22: 72) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 3% (FY22: 2%) of any of total Group revenue, total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe work on 10 of the 14 components (FY22: 11 of the 15 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team.\n\nThe Group team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding of IT is gained centrally on behalf of components that are on the centralised ERP system and findings are shared with relevant component teams.\n- \u00b7 The Group team adopted a centralised approach to testing completeness and accuracy of the data extracted for revenue, purchases and journal entries. Data and analytics routines were performed for 12 components (FY22: 13), and the Group team assessed the outputs of these routines before sending outputs to component auditors and instructing them to test transactions meeting certain criteria.\n\nThese items were audited by the Group team because the Group has a centralised IT system making this an efficient audit approach. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams. The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nThe Group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group profit before tax.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nIn working with component auditors, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components.\n- \u00b7 Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, including specifying the minimum procedures to perform in their audit of revenue using data and analytics procedures, cash and journals.\n- \u00b7 Visited four (FY22: two) components in-person in France and Spain as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit approach. Organised regular video conferences with the partners and Directors of the Group and component audit teams. At these visits and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component audit teams.\n- \u00b7 Inspection of component audit teams' key work papers (in person and/or using remote technology capabilities) to evaluate the quality of execution of the audits of the components with particular focus on work related to significant risk and assessed the appropriateness of conclusion and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule ('DTR') 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R.

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable law and UKadopted international accounting standards. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group had \u00a31,050m of committed debt facilities available from its banking group, USPP bondholders and lease providers, with principal maturities between 2026 and 2030, of which \u00a3381.2m (2022: \u00a3579.3m) was undrawn, together with cash balances of \u00a3172.5m (2022: \u00a3320.6m). The Group's debt facilities have funding covenant requirements, principally the leverage covenant with a maximum level of 3.5x net debt to covenant EBITDA, and interest cover.\n\nThe Directors have reviewed the liquidity and covenant forecasts for the Group's going concern assessment period covering at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Given the time horizon of these forecasts, the risk of climate change is not expected to have a material impact on these forecasts. Based on these forecasts, the Group continues to have significant liquidity headroom and strong financial covenant headroom under its debt facilities.\n\nA reverse stress testing scenario has been performed which assesses that adjusted operating profit would need to fall by over 74% to trigger an event of default as at 30 June 2025. This scenario includes some mitigating actions to conserve cash, including reducing dividends and capital expenditure. Throughout this scenario, the Group continues to have significant liquidity headroom. The Directors do not consider this a plausible scenario. This is consistent with the bottom-up risk scenario modelling for the long-term viability statement which considered severe but plausible, individual, and combined scenarios, none of which trigger an event of default. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Group has long recognised the scale of the climate emergency and considers this to offer both opportunities and risks in the future. The Group's current climate change strategy focuses on reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of bio-based raw materials, whilst the benefits in using its ingredients will enable more carbon to be saved than were emitted through operations and supply chain.\n\nThe impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of these financial statements, including the risks identified as part of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on pages 59 to 67. None of these risks had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. In particular, the Directors have considered the impact of climate change in respect of the following areas.\n\n- \u00b7 Going concern and viability of the Group over the next three years;\n- \u00b7 Post-retirement benefit obligations;\n- \u00b7 Carrying value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment; and\n- \u00b7 The discounted cash flows included in the value in use calculation used in the annual goodwill impairment testing.\n\n159\n\nCroda International Plc\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts\n\n2023\n\nWhilst there is currently no material impact expected from climate change, the Group is aware of the ever-changing risks related to climate change and will continue to developing its assessment of the impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group's significant accounting policies under UK-adopted international accounting standards have been set by management with the approval of the Audit Committee. The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to be made on the applicability of policies to particular situations. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Under UK-adopted international accounting standards an estimate or judgement may be considered significant if it has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or if the estimates have a risk of material adjustment to assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n\nThe significant accounting judgement required when preparing the Group's accounts is as follows:\n\n- (i) Hedge accounting - On 6 February 2023 the Group agreed to acquire Solus Biotech Co Ltd ('Solus') for a total consideration of KRW350bn, a highly probable future business combination (hedged item). In line with the Group's currency risk management strategy, the currency exposure for the Group, which has a Sterling functional and presentational currency, was managed through the execution of a deal contingent foreign exchange forward contract (hedging instrument). This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge and therefore hedge accounting was applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe application of hedge accounting for a deal contingent instrument requires significant judgement to determine whether the underlying transaction was highly probable, which is a requirement for the initial application of hedge accounting. The Group's assessment that the underlying transaction was highly probable, and therefore hedge accounting can be applied, is a key judgement. The primary consideration in forming this conclusion was in relation to the required regulatory approval, which was considered highly probable to be achieved based on an assessment of internal and external evidence. This judgement, and the subsequent application of hedge accounting, resulted in a \u00a319.3m FX loss being deferred in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to goodwill, rather than being recognised in the income statement. During the year, a hedge ineffectiveness loss of \u00a34.6m was recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses and reported as an exceptional item as part of business acquisition costs. The forward contract was settled during the year resulting in a cash outflow of \u00a323.9m.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates required when preparing the Group's accounts are as follows:\n\n- (i) Post-retirement benefits - As disclosed in note 11, the Group's principal retirement benefit schemes are of the defined benefit type. Year end recognition of the liabilities under these schemes and the valuation of assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant assumptions to be made, relating to key financial market indicators such as inflation and expectations on future salary growth and asset returns. These assumptions are made by the Group in conjunction with the schemes' actuaries and the Directors are of the view that any estimation should be appropriate and in line with consensus opinion.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies continued Group Accounting Policies continued\n\nThe critical accounting estimate specifically relates to the Group's UK scheme, given the size of the liabilities and their sensitivity to underlying assumptions, including the impact of climate change on life expectancy. Small changes in these assumptions could result in a material adjustment to carrying values in the next financial year.\n\n- (ii) Goodwill impairment - Management are required to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite lived assets such as goodwill. Accordingly, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment by comparing the carrying value of the underlying Cash Generating Units ('CGUs') to their recoverable amount calculated by detailed value in use calculations. These value in use calculations require the use of estimates to enable the calculation of the net present value of cash flow projections of the relevant CGU. The critical assumptions are as follows:\n- -Cash flow projections - based on management's most recent riskadjusted view of future trading specific to the individual CGU, with assumptions on term and EBITDA growth (calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) as a result of fluctuating revenue and operating margins through the ability to pass on future raw material price increases.\n- -Terminal value growth in EBITDA - set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term average growth rate, estimated at 3%.\n- -Discount rate - set using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU.\n\nThe significant accounting estimate relates to the goodwill impairment review of the Flavours and Croda Korea CGUs. Given the impairment charge reported in the prior year the Flavours CGU has low headroom. The recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom, is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at these key assumptions. The assumptions selected and associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 12. Although it is not management's current expectation, these sensitivities provide the impact on the recoverable amount when applying a reasonably possible change in the assumptions. The goodwill impairment review of Croda Korea CGU represents a further source of significant estimation uncertainty due to the proximity of acquisition and resultant low level of headroom. Post-acquisition trading is in line with expectations. Given the size of the goodwill balances and the carrying values' sensitivity to the underlying assumptions, small changes could result in a material adjustment to the carrying values in the next financial year.\n\nThe impact of climate change risks, with a particular focus on the impact of carbon pricing, has been considered as part of the impairment testing. The discounted cash flows included in the value in use calculations reflect the carbon costs of the CGU based on the latest scope 1 and 2 emissions data and applying a shadow carbon price of \u00a3124/tonne in line with the UK Government Green Guide. The cost of carbon has an immaterial effect on the recoverable amount of each standalone CGU and as such carbon costs are not deemed to be a key assumption. The Directors are aware of the ever-changing risks attached to climate change and will regularly assess these risks against judgements and estimates made in future impairment testing.\n\n2023\n\nThe Group's accounts include other areas of estimation. While these areas do not meet the definition of significant accounting estimates, the recognition and measurement of certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions. The other areas of accounting estimates are:\n\n(i) Valuation of acquired intangible assets (note 28) - On acquisition, intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they can be identified through being separable from the acquired entity or arising from specific contractual or legal rights. Once recognised, such intangible assets will be initially valued using an appropriate methodology. The acquisition date fair value of intangible assets acquired are based on a number of assumptions including discount rate, royalty rates, growth rates and customer attrition.\n\n- (ii)  Goodwill impairment review of the Avanti and Fragrances CGUs (note 12) - the recoverable amount, and therefore level of headroom, is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at the cash flow projections, terminal value growth rate, and the discount rate.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n- (i) The Group adopted the following new accounting policies on 1 January 2023 to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting pronouncements, none of which had a material impact on the Group's financial reporting on adoption, are:\n- -IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' and Amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts';\n- -Amendments to IAS 1 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies';\n- -Amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current';\n- -Amendment to IAS 8 'Definition of Accounting Estimates'; and\n- -Amendment to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction' and 'International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules'.\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' became effective on 1 January 2023 and establishes requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard and is applied retrospectively. An impact assessment has been performed and has not resulted in a material impact to the Group financial reporting.\n\nAs part of this review it was identified that the Group issues product warranties as part of the normal course of business which would meet the definition of an insurance contract. As the warranties are issued in connection to the sale of goods, the Group is exempt from applying the requirements of IFRS 17 and instead applies IFRS 15 'Revenue' and IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\nThe Group operates a captive insurance company to self-insure certain risks either in full or in part. As this self-insurance operates within the Group, IFRS 17 has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has also issued Parent Company guarantee arrangements. The Group has not previously asserted that these arrangements are considered insurance contracts and has therefore taken advantage of the accounting policy choice to apply IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation', IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' rather than apply IFRS 17.",

It is registered in England and Wales and the address of its registered office can be found on page 205.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Parent Company has control. The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nIntra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.\n\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nThe Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with the equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as equity. Gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nOn acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as CGUs.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. For goodwill balances where the relevant group of CGUs exceeds the size of the Group's operating segments, impairment testing is performed at the operating segment level.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised immediately against the goodwill value. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is measured on a market-based approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. Value in use is estimated with reference to estimated risk adjusted future post-tax cash flows in real terms discounted to net present value using a market participant real posttax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and size risk premium specific to the CGU. Post-tax calculations, rather than pre-tax, are used as they are considered more accurate. For disclosure purposes, pre-tax discount rates are then back-solved using the equivalent pre-tax cash flows, and therefore there is no material difference between the calculations on a pre-tax or post-tax basis. Where required, specific risks associated with the CGU are adjusted through changes to the future cash flow projections. The Group uses growth estimates that track below the Group's historical growth rates unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a different treatment.\n\n## Other intangible assets arising on acquisition\n\nOn acquisition, intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they can be identified through being separable from the acquired entity or arising from specific contractual or legal rights.\n\nOnce recognised, such intangible assets will be initially valued using an appropriate methodology. For the acquisition in the year the following intangible asset types recognised and valuation methodologies applied were:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology processes (relief-from-royalty)\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships (income approach)\n\nFollowing initial recognition, the assets will be written down on a straightline basis over their useful lives, which range from 7 to 20 years for technology processes and from 3 to 20 years for trade names, brands and customer relationships. Useful lives are regularly reviewed to ensure their continuing relevance.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific, technical or commercial knowledge and understanding, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred. Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are applied to a plan for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'. Development uncertainties typically mean that such criteria are not met, most commonly because the Group can only demonstrate the existence of a market at a late stage in the product development cycle, at which point the material element of project spend has already been incurred and charged to the income statement. This includes, for example, substantiating potential product claims for use by our customers. Until the desired outcome of such work can be proven, at an economic production cost, the market for a product cannot be said to exist. Furthermore, the Group does not have the ability to reliably measure the development expenditure attributable to all projects during development.\n\nWhere, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch.",

Any impairment losses are written off to the income statement.\n\n## Computer software\n\nCloud computing arrangements are assessed and classified as either service contracts or intangible assets. Computer software licences that meet the definition of an intangible asset, covering a period of greater than a year, are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 7 years.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes intra-Group sales. The Group recognises revenue on completion of contractual performance obligations, generally when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nThe principal activity from which the Group generates revenue is the supply of products to customers from its various manufacturing sites and warehouses, and in some limited instances from consignment inventory held on customer sites. Products are supplied under a variety of standard terms and conditions, and in each case, revenue is recognised when contractual performance obligations between the Group and the customer are satisfied. This will typically be on dispatch or delivery. When sales discount and rebate arrangements result in net variable consideration, appropriate adjustments are recognised as a deduction from revenue at the point of sale. The Group typically uses the expected value method for estimating rebates, reflecting that such contracts have similar characteristics and a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not be required.\n\n## Interest and dividend income\n\nInterest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Government grants\n\nThe Group recognises government grant income related to assets when the grant becomes receivable and deducts the income from the cost of the associated asset. Government grant income is recognised separately in the Group statement of cash flows.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe Group's sales, marketing and research activities are organised into three global market sectors, being Consumer Care, Life Sciences and Industrial Specialties. These are the segments for which summary management information is presented to the Group's Executive Committee, which is deemed to be the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker.\n\n2023\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' (revised). In respect of defined benefit plans (pension plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation), obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans are the net of plan obligations and assets. A scheme surplus is only recognised as an asset in the balance sheet when the Group has the unconditional right to future economic benefits in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. For those schemes where an accounting surplus is currently recognised, the Group expects to recover the value through reduced future contributions. No allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of either the future expenses of running the schemes or for non-service-related death in service benefits which may arise in the future. The operating costs of such plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised as financial income or an expense as appropriate.\n\nService costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined contribution schemes (pension plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity) are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Other post-retirement benefits\n\nSome Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either (i) terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or (ii) providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of cash and equity settled, share-based incentive schemes. These are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payments', which requires an expense to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The expense is based on the fair value of each instrument which is calculated using the Black Scholes or binomial model as appropriate. Any expense is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting for non-marketbased performance criteria.",

        "page_content": "## Currency translations and hyperinflation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Group operate in hyperinflationary economies. Where considered significant, the results of those subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect the current purchasing power of that currency at the year end, as if that rate had applied to the results of the entity for the whole period. Any gain or loss on monetary assets and liabilities is recognised within operating costs in the Group income statement as a net monetary gain or loss.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial period. Exchange profits or losses on trading transactions are included in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency and are not considered to be hyperinflationary are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;\n- (ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and\n- (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies, the results and financial position are translated into the Group's presentation currency using the closing rate for all transactions, rather than at an average rate for income and expense items.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders' equity.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. Temporary differences arise on differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax base. Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences. No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit such earnings.\n\nSimilarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such differences can be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax, which is a liability under Pillar Two legislation, is an income tax in the scope of IAS12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.\n\nFollowing adoption of amendments to IAS12 the Group has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right of use assets.\n\nAll taxation is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Income statement presentation\n\nAdjusted results are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the columnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. The same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those items that in the Directors' view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. In the current year exceptional items relate to a goodwill impairment to the carrying value of the Chinese SIPO cash generating unit in Industrial Specialties, acquisition costs and restructuring costs associated with changes to the Group's operating model. Exceptional items in the prior year related to the gain on business disposal, discount unwind and fair value adjustment in respect of contingent consideration, goodwill impairment and property, plant and equipment impairment. Details can be found in note 3 on pages 165 and 166.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part of a business combination. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. The Group's policy is to write off the difference between the cost of all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\nReviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence, the impact of climate change, sites decarbonisation road maps, as well as normal wear and tear, and adjustments are made where appropriate. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 15 to 40 years for land and buildings, and 3 to 25 years for plant and equipment. All individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Group's 'plant and equipment' asset class predominantly relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Group's manufacturing facilities. Consequently, the Group does not seek to analyse out of this class other items such as motor vehicles and office equipment.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies continued Group Accounting Policies continued\n\nThe TCFD on pages 59 to 67 highlights the riverine flood risk across specific sites. The sites with significant risk of flood account for 14.9% of Group revenue in 2023 and include 12.2% of the Group's property, plant and equipment net book value. Due to the mitigations detailed in the TCFD, climate change does not have a material impact on the net book value or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired. If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In addition to this, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## Leases\n\nWhen entering into a new contract, the Group assesses whether it is, or contains, a lease. A lease conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date and discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, more typically, the Group's incremental borrowing rate (when the implicit rate cannot be readily determined).\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or changes in the Group's assessment of whether a purchase, extension or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe Group adopts recognition exemptions for short-term (less than 12 months) and low value leases and elects not to separate lease components from any associated fixed non-lease components.\n\nThe Group classifies payments of lease liabilities (principal and interest portions) as part of financing activities. Payments of short-term, low value and variable lease components are classified within operating activities.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments where deemed appropriate to hedge its exposure to interest rates and short-term currency rate fluctuations. The Group's accounting policy is set out below.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument as either: (i) a hedge of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (ii) a hedge of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge).\n\n2023\n\n## (i) Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives, for example interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. The forward elements of the forward exchange contracts are excluded from the designation of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging, which is recognised in equity in a cost of hedging reserve. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the current amount and timing of the respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the time or amount of the hedged transactions.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhen a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. With the exception of contingent consideration and forward foreign exchange contracts, trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based on the present value of the expected future payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value and associated discount unwind are recognised in the income statement. Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value on a mark-to-market basis.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount on a first in first out basis. Cost comprises all expenditure, including related production overheads, incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the inventory to its location and condition at the balance sheet date. Net realisable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable variable selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where appropriate. Profits arising on intra-group sales are eliminated in so far as the product remains in Group inventory at the year end.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is recognised based on lifetime expected losses, but principally comprises balances where objective evidence exists that the amount will not be collectible. Such amounts are written down to their estimated recoverable amounts, with the charge being made to operating expenses.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Cash and bank overdrafts are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, there is an intention to settle on a net basis and interest is charged on a net basis.\n\n## Environmental, restructuring, site restoration and other provisions\n\nThe Group is exposed to certain liabilities relating to its operations. Provisions are made immediately where a legal or constructive obligation is identified, can be quantified and it is regarded as more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. The Group does consider the impact of discounting when establishing provisions and provisions are discounted when the impact is material and the timing of cash flows can be estimated with reasonable certainty.\n\n## Share capital\n\n## Investment in own shares\n\n- (i) Employee share ownership trusts - shares acquired by the trustees of the employee share ownership trust (the Trustees), funded by the Company and held for the continuing benefit of the Company are shown as a reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent. Movements in the year arising from additional purchases by the Trustees of shares or the receipt of funds due to the exercise of options by employees are accounted for within reserves and shown as a movement in equity attributable to owners of the parent in the year. Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company's income statement as incurred.\n- (ii) Treasury shares - where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital as treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability when the liability is irrevocable. Accordingly, final dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders and interim dividends are recognised when paid.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are measured at fair value, with movements in the fair value being recognised in the income statement or equity on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of results. Investments are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment.",

The reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items is 27.2% (2022: 16.2%).\n\nCroda operates in many tax jurisdictions other than the UK, both as a manufacturer and distributor, with the majority of those jurisdictions having rates higher than the UK; considerably so in some cases. It is the exposure to these different tax rates that increases the effective tax rate above the UK standard rate and also makes it difficult to forecast the Group's future tax rate with any certainty given the unpredictable nature of exchange rates, individual economies and tax legislators. Croda's effective corporate tax rate has also increased as a result of incurring expenditure which is deemed capital in nature for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill, which is not tax deductible. The factors increasing the effective tax rate are largely offset by the prior year release of tax provisions. Otherwise, there are no significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported tax charge based on its reported accounting profit. Given the global nature of the Group, and the number of associated cross-border transactions between connected parties, we are exposed to potential adjustments to the price charged for those transactions by tax authorities. However, the Group carries appropriate provisions relating to the level of risk.\n\nThe prior year reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items includes the tax arising on the gain of the PTIC divestment and associated business disposal costs. Whilst the gain was subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which business units were sold, a number of local exemptions have resulted in the overall gain being taxed at a rate significantly lower than the UK's 2022 standard tax rate of 19%. This has reduced the reported corporate tax rate after exceptional items in the prior year.\n\nLegislation to increase the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, effective from 1 April 2023, which has resulted in a blended UK rate of corporation tax of 23.5% in 2023. The UK deferred tax is calculated at 25%. The overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe UK, like many other jurisdictions, brought into effect its supporting Pillar 2 tax legislation from 31 December 2023. First applicable to the Group's 31 December 2024 period end, this legislation will effectively mandate the incurrence of a minimum effective tax rate of 15% (in aggregate) across each of its trading jurisdictions. Croda's effective tax rate would not have been materially impacted had Pillar 2 applied in 2023. Initial assessments, supported through an appraisal of those preliminary safe harbours communicated by the OECD, validate the Group's view that no material tax exposures are expected to arise under this legislation in 2024.",

Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2024 and beyond has been measured using the rate due to prevail in the year of reversal.\n\nFollowing the amendment to IAS12, requiring the separate recognition of deferred tax in relation to lease liabilities and the corresponding right of use assets, deferred tax balances have been recognised separately on these items.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised in all material cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered. At 31 December 2023, the unrecognised deferred tax asset was \u00a39.9m in respect of losses of \u00a340.4m (2022: unrecognised deferred tax asset of \u00a39.6m on losses of \u00a339.1m) across the Group, as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future. If all earnings were remitted, an additional \u00a319.1m (2022: \u00a315.8m) of tax would be payable on unremitted earnings of \u00a3469m (2022: \u00a3462m).\n\nAll movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in the income statement with the exception of the items shown in note 5(b).\n\nOf the gross deferred tax assets, \u00a31.0m are expected to reverse within 12 months of the balance sheet date. No material reversal of any of the deferred tax liability is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date based on the Group's current capital expenditure programme.\n\n2023",

The US Retirement Plan, which is closed to new members, operates a cash balance pension scheme that provides a guaranteed rate of return on pension contributions until retirement (other than for a small number of 'grandfathered' employees). The US plans also do not generally receive inflationary increases once in payment. With the exception of this difference in inflationary risk, the Group's main defined benefit pension schemes continue to face materially similar risks, as described on pages 174 and 175.\n\nAll of the Group's final salary type pension schemes (which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life based on salary in the final years leading up to retirement) are closed to future service accrual with the exception of a small number of 'grandfathered' employees in the US scheme.\n\nThe majority of the Group's retirement benefit asset relates to the Group's UK pension scheme. The UK pension scheme is open to future service accrual and therefore the surplus is recognised on the basis that this could be recovered through a reduction in future service contributions.\n\nThe majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.\n\nPlan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, predominantly lies with the particular scheme's board of trustees with appropriate input from the relevant Group company. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each scheme's regulations and any relevant legislation.\n\nDuring 2022 the business divestment resulted in a curtailment gain of \u00a33.9m on cessation of defined benefit accrual, primarily within the Group's UK pension scheme, which was recognised in the Group income statement as part of the gain on business disposal.",

Where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. The UK mortality improvement scale has been updated to CMI 2022, in order to reflect the most recent CMI model with default weight parameters for 2020 (0%), 2021 (0%) and 2022 (25%) to provide for uncertainty around the long-term impact of Covid-19 on life expectancy. Applying the mortality tables adopted, the expected future average lifetime of members currently at age 65 and members at age 65 in 20 years' time is as follows:\n\n|        | Current age 65   | Current age 65   | Age 65 in   20 years   | Age 65 in   20 years   |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|        | UK               | US               | UK                     | US                     |\n| Male   | 19.6             | 21.0             | 20.9                   | 22.2                   |\n| Female | 22.9             | 22.9             | 24.3                   | 24.0                   |\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the significant assumptions is as follows:\n\n|                                                          | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Sensitivity                               | Of increase                               | Of decrease                               |\n| Discount rate                                            | 0.5%                                      | -6.3%                                     | 7.1%                                      |\n| Inflation rate                                           | 0.5%                                      | 4.4%                                      | -4.5%                                     |\n| Mortality (assumes a one-year change in life expectancy) | 1 year                                    | 4.0%                                      | -4.1%                                     |\n\nThe above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 13.7 years (2022: 14.3 years).\n\nThe assets in the schemes comprised:\n\n|                                          | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2023  %   | Restated  2022  \u00a3m   | Restated  2022  %   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Quoted                                   |            |           |                      |                     |\n| Equities                                 | 74.4       | 8%        | 70.1                 | 7%                  |\n| Government bonds                         | 394.5      | 40%       | 336.9                | 36%                 |\n| Corporate bonds                          | 57.5       | 6%        | 56.3                 | 6%                  |\n| Other quoted securities                  | 22.8       | 2%        | 24.2                 | 2%                  |\n| Unquoted                                 |            |           |                      |                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                | 61.0       | 6%        | 98.1                 | 10%                 |\n| Real estate (pooled investment vehicles) | 40.1       | 4%        | 60.3                 | 6%                  |\n| Derivatives                              | 5.7        | 1%        | (46.1)               | -5%                 |\n| Hedge funds                              | -          | 0%        | 205.3                | 21%                 |\n| Infrastructure funds                     | 159.6      | 17%       | 164.2                | 17%                 |\n| Other                                    | 151.5      | 16%       | -                    | 0%                  |\n|                                          | 967.1      | 100%      | 969.3                | 100%                |\n\nDerivatives presented above represent the scheme's net position on Government bond repurchase agreements and other swap contracts (valued on a mark-to-market basis) which form part of the scheme's Liability Driven Investment (LDI) portfolio.

The schemes hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term. As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities. However, the Group and the pension trustees (Trustees) believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group's long-term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently. See below for more details on the Group's asset-liability matching strategy.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nSome of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, the level of inflationary increases is usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation. The majority of the schemes' assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit. In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes' liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes. Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous years.\n\nInvestments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A significant portion of assets in 2023 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds. The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long-term with an acceptable level of risk. The UK scheme makes use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.\n\nThe Trustee and Company are working on the 30 September 2023 triennial valuation, and initial results shared with the Company show that the funding position has improved and that the cost of providing benefits has fallen. The Trustee and Company are working closely with their advisers to secure the long-term security of members' benefits, with changes such as a further reduction in investment risk completed in 2023. The next triennial valuation of the UK scheme will be as at 30 September 2026. The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually. As at 1 December 2022 the scheme was 122.4% funded.\n\n2023",

This goodwill is allocated to the Group's Cash Generating Units (CGUs) expected to benefit from that combination based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows.\n\nAs discussed in the accounting policies note on page 159, goodwill is tested annually for impairment with reference to the relevant CGU's recoverable amount compared to the unit's carrying value including goodwill. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections with the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Five year cash flow projections - based on management's most recent risk-adjusted view of future trading specific to the individual CGU, with assumptions on EBITDA growth (calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) as a result of fluctuating revenue and operating margins through the ability to pass on future raw material price increases.\n- \u00b7 Terminal value growth in EBITDA - set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU operates but not exceeding the Group's long-term average growth rate, estimated at 3% given the markets and territories the Group operates in.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - set using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to operating business segments as follows:\n\n|                        | 2023                 | 2023                    | 2023      | 2023                 | 2022                    | 2022      |\n|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n|                        | Standalone  CGUs  \u00a3m | Allocated  goodwill  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Standalone  CGUs  \u00a3m | Allocated  goodwill  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m |\n| Consumer Care          | 461.7                | 215.2                   | 676.9     | 370.3                | 219.2                   | 589.5     |\n| Life Sciences          | 190.6                | 70.4                    | 261.0     | 163.3                | 69.2                    | 232.5     |\n| Industrial Specialties | -                    | -                       | -         | 22.6                 | -                       | 22.6      |\n|                        | 652.3                | 285.6                   | 937.9     | 556.2                | 288.4                   | 844.6     |\n\nThe allocated goodwill primarily relates to \u00a363m (2022: \u00a363m) associated with the 2020 acquisition of Iberchem as it relates to revenue synergies with Croda's existing Consumer Care business and \u00a3192m (2022: \u00a3192m) associated with the 2006 acquisition of Uniqema (with all other balances individually less than \u00a310m). Due to the geographical and operational scale of the Uniqema acquisition, this goodwill balance is tested for impairment at an operating business segment level. Standalone CGUs operate independently of the Group's core regional operating assets, are capable of generating largely independent cash inflows and therefore goodwill relating to standalone CGUs is tested separately for impairment annually.\n\nFor impairment testing performed at an operating business segment level, cash flow projections are based on the Group's current year results and a growth rate of 3% (an appropriate risk-adjusted view based on past experience reflecting the market and territories in which the Group operates), discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 11.4% pre-tax (2022: 9.9%). No reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the operating segments to be less than their carrying value. Based on the testing performed, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n2023",

Cash flow projections have been based on specific risk adjusted estimates taking management's most recent view of medium-term trading prospects. All cashflow projections are over a 5 year period unless the Directors believe that steady state growth will not be achieved over this timeframe. Croda Korea Limited's cash flow projections have been extended to 10 years to better reflect the early growth phase of the acquired business and when it will reach a steady state. Unless otherwise stated, cash flow projections assume an appropriate view of past experience, specifically considering revenue growth in relation to market share, maintaining operating margins, maintenance capital expenditure and working capital days. Discount rates have been calculated for standalone CGUs set using specific weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU. The terminal value growth rates and discount rates applied in these CGU level calculations are set out below:\n\n|                                                | 2023   | Terminal value  growth rate  2022   | 2023   | Pre-tax  discount rate  2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|\n| Incotec                                        | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 14.5%  | 11.0%                          |\n| Biosector                                      | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 13.8%  | 13.6%                          |\n| Sipo                                           | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 12.8%  | 12.4%                          |\n| Avanti                                         | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 13.5%  | 12.8%                          |\n| Fragrances                                     | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 12.3%  | 10.6%                          |\n| Flavours                                       | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 12.3%  | 10.5%                          |\n| Alban Muller                                   | 3.0%   | 3.0%                                | 13.9%  | 12.8%                          |\n| Croda Korea Limited (formerly 'Solus Biotech') | 3.0%   | n/a                                 | 13.1%  | n/a                            |\n\nAn impairment of \u00a320.8m was recorded in relation to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Sipo. This principally reflected the decline in the profitability of the business in the period driven by adverse external market conditions, impacting both demand and pricing, which are expected to continue over the medium term. The assumptions underpinning the cash flow projection used in the value in use calculation reflect management's most recent forecast combined with an appropriate view of past experience, specifically EBITDA compound average growth rates (CAGR) as a result of changing revenue, cost of sales and operating costs over the period.\n\nExcluding SIPO, based on the annual impairment testing performed for all standalone CGUs no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023 and standalone CGUs remain on track to perform to our long-term expectations. In forming this conclusion, the Directors have reviewed sensitivity analysis which considered a range of possibilities on key assumptions, both individually and in combination, and considered whether these would give rise to an impairment. Excluding Flavours & Croda Korea Limited, this analysis concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Standalone CGUs to be less than the carrying value.\n\nFor Croda Korea Limited, the assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections used in the value in use calculation reflect delivery of the acquisition business plan, which the business remains on track to achieve in the medium to long term. The estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded their carrying value by approximately \u00a319m and therefore the Directors concluded that no impairment was required; however, the calculation is sensitive to achieving the acquisition plan, specifically that operating margins will improve and sales growth targets will be achieved over the 10 year projections.\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of Avanti, Fragrances and Flavours CGUs exceeded their carrying value therefore the Directors concluded that no impairment was required; however, the calculations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions. The range of key assumptions considered by the Directors, where a change could give rise to an impairment, were the EBITDA compound annual growth rates as a result of increasing revenue growth rates and improving operating margins through cost of sales and operating costs, pre-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate.

In practice, some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## Climate risk and impairment testing\n\nThe impact of climate change risks including the risks identified as part of the TCFD disclosures on page 59 to 67, with a particular focus on the impact of carbon pricing, has been considered as part of the impairment testing. The discounted cash flows included in the value in use calculations reflect the carbon costs of the CGU based on the latest scope 1 and 2 emissions data and applying a shadow carbon price of \u00a3124/tonne in line with the UK Government Green Guide.\n\nThe cost of carbon has an immaterial effect on the recoverable amount of each of the standalone CGUs and as such carbon costs are not deemed to be a key assumption. The Directors are aware of the ever-changing risks attached to climate change and will regularly assess these risks against judgements and estimates made in future impairment testing.\n\n2023",

On 27 June 2016, the Group issued \u00a3100m (\u00a370m and \u00a330m) and \u20ac100m (\u20ac70m and \u20ac30m) of fixed rate notes. On 6 June 2019, the Group issued a further \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m of fixed rate notes. In June 2023, the existing \u00a330m and \u20ac30m fixed rate 7 year notes matured and were repaid.\n\nThe table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities. Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.\n\n|                                       | Book  value  2023  \u00a3m   | Fair  value  2023  \u00a3m   | Book  value  2022  \u00a3m   | Fair  value  2022  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Cash deposits                         | 172.5                   | 172.5                   | 320.6                   | 320.6                   |\n| Other investments                     | 1.9                     | 1.9                     | 3.4                     | 3.4                     |\n| 2019 Club facility due 2026           | (216.8)                 | (216.8)                 | (18.0)                  | (18.0)                  |\n| US$100m 3.75% fixed rate 10 year note | (78.5)                  | (71.5)                  | (83.0)                  | (74.4)                  |\n| \u20ac30m 1.08% fixed rate 7 year note     | -                       | -                       | (26.5)                  | (26.3)                  |\n| \u20ac70m 1.43% fixed rate 10 year note    | (60.8)                  | (58.2)                  | (61.9)                  | (57.8)                  |\n| \u00a330m 2.54% fixed rate 7 year note     | -                       | -                       | (30.0)                  | (29.7)                  |\n| \u00a370m 2.80% fixed rate 10 year note    | (70.0)                  | (66.1)                  | (70.0)                  | (64.8)                  |\n| \u20ac50m 1.18% fixed rate 8 year note     | (43.5)                  | (40.9)                  | (44.2)                  | (40.1)                  |\n| \u00a365m 2.46% fixed rate 8 year note     | (65.0)                  | (59.8)                  | (65.0)                  | (58.1)                  |\n| US$60m 3.70% fixed rate 10 year note  | (47.1)                  | (43.7)                  | (49.8)                  | (45.4)                  |\n| Other bank borrowings                 | (34.0)                  | (34.0)                  | (51.6)                  | (51.6)                  |\n| Other loans                           | (8.3)                   | (8.3)                   | (22.6)                  | (22.6)                  |\n| Contingent consideration              | -                       | -                       | (9.9)                   | (9.9)                   |\n| Preference share capital              | (1.1)                   | (1.1)                   | (1.1)                   | (1.1)                   |\n| Forward foreign currency contracts    | -                       | -                       | (1.3)                   | (1.3)                   |\n\nFor financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short-term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.",

Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value use the following hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)\n- \u00b7 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)\n- \u00b7 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).\n\nAll of the Group's financial instruments are classed as level 2 with the exception of contingent consideration, other investments and lease liabilities, which are classed as level 3.\n\n## Preference share capital\n\n|                                                                           | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital comprises: |            |            |\n| 615,562 5.9% preference shares of \u00a31 (2022: 615,562)                      | 0.6        | 0.6        |\n| 498,434 6.6% preference shares of \u00a31 (2022: 498,434)                      | 0.5        | 0.5        |\n| 21,900 7.5% preference shares of \u00a31 (2022: 21,900)                        | -          | -          |\n|                                                                           | 1.1        | 1.1        |\n\nThe preference shares have no redemption rights and carry no voting rights other than in certain circumstances affecting the rights of the preference shareholders, details of which are set out in the Company's Articles of Association. The three classes of preference shares rank pari passu with each other but ahead of the ordinary shares on a winding up. Rights on a winding up are limited to repayment of capital and any arrears of dividends.\n\n## Borrowing facilities\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3381.2m (2022: \u00a3579.3m). In addition, the Group had other undrawn facilities of \u00a370.5m (2022: \u00a353.1m) available. All of the Group's total committed facilities of \u00a31,050.0m expire after 2024. New and repaid borrowings disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows reflect routine short-term cash management, comprising regular monthly drawdowns and repayments on the Group's revolving credit facilities. It also reflects the repayments made to the Group's revolving credit facility and the term loan facility following the business disposal in the prior year.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee. Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk. Regular reports are received from all sectors and regional operating units to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken. In the management definition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. The Group's risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group's foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so. Currency exposure arising from significant one-off transactions (for example acquisitions or disposals) is reviewed and hedged through forward contracts if required.\n\nFor 2023, had the Group's basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker/stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been \u00a319.0m (2022: \u00a327.6m) lower/higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Group's overseas entities, and equity would have been \u00a3204.8m (2022: \u00a3162.4m) lower/higher.\n\n2023",

        "page_content": "## Cash flow hedging\n\nDuring the year, the Group held an instrument to hedge an exposure to changes in foreign currency on a highly probable future business combination (hedged item). At commencement, the nominal value of the contract was \u00a3223.6m and the average forward contract rate was 1480 (KRW:GBP). The contract, which was contingent on the successful completion of the business acquisition, was designated as a cash flow hedge and provided certainty over approximately 97% of the estimated FX exposure on the forecast future transaction. The forecast future transaction was completed in the year ended 31 December 2023 and the associated instrument settled. The cumulative cash flow hedging reserve of \u00a319.3m debit was reclassified to goodwill, presented as part of the cash consideration amount in note 27. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the associated hedge ineffectiveness of \u00a34.6m has been recognised in the Group income statement within operating costs (administrative expenses) and reported as an exceptional item (business acquisition costs). The cash flow in relation to both the effective and ineffective portions of the hedge has been recorded as an investing activity in the Group statement of cash flows in accordance with the underlying hedged cash flow. In the prior year, the cumulative cash flow hedging reserve of \u00a36.5m credit and cost of hedging reserves of \u00a36.0m debit were reclassified to the income statement and reported within the gain on business disposal.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. In 2016, the Group had a policy of maintaining no more than 60% of its gross borrowings at fixed interest rates in normal circumstances. During 2016, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3136m special dividend and consequent increase in core debt requirements. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a3100m and \u20ac100m with an average maturity of 2.5 years and interest rate of 2.16%. During 2017, the policy formally increased the upper limit for fixed rate debt to 75% of gross borrowings. During 2019, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3151.5m special dividend. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m with an average maturity of 4.1 years and interest rate of 2.48%. In January 2020 the Group repaid its US$100m 10 year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 5.94% and replaced it with a US$100m 10 year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 3.75%. In June 2023, the existing \u00a330m and \u20ac30m fixed rate 7 year notes matured and were repaid. At 31 December 2023, approximately 51% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, aside from the loan notes referred to above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 2.64% (2022: 2.55%). As at 31 December 2023, the Group's floating rate liabilities are based on SONIA, SOFR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency.\n\nBased on the above, had interest rates moved by 100 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post-tax profits would have moved by \u00a32.7m (2022: \u00a33.6m) due to a change in interest expense on the Group's floating rate borrowings.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.\n\nOn a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Group's cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders. The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital.\n\nIn order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt. Given the Group's strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 47 to 50.\n\nUnderlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group. The definition of ROIC has been revised in the year to exclude the Group's net retirement benefit balances from invested capital, given they are not operating in nature. Comparative information presented in the Five year record has been restated to reflect the new definition. The Group's ROIC now stands at 8.3% against a post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 8.1%. The Group's target is to maintain ROIC at two to three times WACC over the long-term. In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure its ability to service its debt. Both net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2023. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 47 to 50. The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year. Additional information on progress against key performance indicators can be found on pages 34 to 37.",

The provisions are based on most recently available facts and prior experience and are recorded at the estimated amount as at the balance sheet date. The Directors expect that the balance will be utilised within 10 years.\n\nThe site restoration provisions relate to certain leased sites with an existing obligation to restore the environment or dismantle assets. The provisions are based on most recently available facts and prior experience and are recorded at the estimated amount as at the balance sheet date. The associated leased sites have remaining terms of between 17 and 43 years.\n\nDuring the year, a restructuring provision has been created associated with changes to the Group's operating model. This provision is expected to be utilised within one year.\n\nThe Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the size of the provisions and utilisation timescales, the impact is not material.\n\n## 22.

The PSP provides for awards of free shares (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years dependent upon an EPS performance related sliding scale (non-market condition), an NPP growth measure (non-market condition), sustainability conditions in relation to decarbonisation roadmaps and emissions (non-market conditions) and the Group's total shareholder return (market condition). The PSP is discussed in detail in the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 106 to 134). Shares (on an after-tax basis) are subject to a two-year post vesting holding period. For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2023  2022             | 2023  2022             | 2023  2022             | 2023  2022             | 2023  2022             | 2023  2022             |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                     | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  |\n| Grant date                          | 02 May 2023            | 02 May 2023            | 17 Mar 2023            | 17 Mar 2023            | 22 Mar 2022            | 22 Mar 2022            |\n| Share price at grant date           | 6962p                  | 6962p                  | 6401p                  | 6401p                  | 7390p                  | 7390p                  |\n| Number of employees                 | 2                      | 2                      | 68                     | 68                     | 67                     | 67                     |\n| Shares under conditional award      | 1,599                  | 2,970                  | 55,367                 | 102,825                | 42,676                 | 79,254                 |\n| Vesting period                      | Three years            | Three years            | Three years            | Three years            | Three years            | Three years            |\n| Expected volatility                 | 27%                    | 27%                    | 27%                    | 27%                    | 24%                    | 24%                    |\n| Dividend yield                      | 1.6%                   | 1.6%                   | 1.8%                   | 1.8%                   | 1.4%                   | 1.4%                   |\n| Possibility of forfeiture           | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             |\n| Fair value per option at grant date | 3558p                  | 6647p                  | 3119p                  | 5800p                  | 3111p                  | 7098p                  |\n| Option pricing model                | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation |\n\n| A reconciliation of option movements over the year is as follows:               | 2023      | 2023                               | 2022      | 2022                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Number    | Weighted  average  exercise  price | Number    | Weighted  average  exercise   price |\n| Outstanding at 1 January                                                        | 399,115   | -                                  | 426,300   | -                                   |\n| Granted                                                                         | 162,761   | -                                  | 121,930   | -                                   |\n| Forfeited                                                                       | (19,961)  | -                                  | (14,536)  | -                                   |\n| Exercised                                                                       | (146,711) | -                                  | (134,579) | -                                   |\n| Outstanding at 31 December                                                      | 395,204   | -                                  | 399,115   | -                                   |\n| For options exercised in year, weighted average share price at date of exercise |           | 6641p                              |           | 6870p                               |\n| Weighted average remaining life at 31 December (years)                          | 1.3       |                                    | 1.2       |                                     |",

Under the DBSP, one third of any annual bonuses due to certain senior executives are deferred. The size of award is determined by the amount of the total bonus divided by one third and converted into a number of Croda shares using the market value of shares at the time the award is granted. Awards are increased by the number of shares equating to the equivalent value of any dividend paid during the option period. The awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant unless the recipient has been dismissed for cause. There are no performance conditions applied to the award.

Under the scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month. For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years' service. The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.\n\n## 24. Shareholders' equity\n\nCroda International Plc Qualifying Share Ownership Trust (QUEST), Croda International Plc Employee Benefit Trust (CIPEBT) and Croda International Plc AESOP Trust (AESOP) each hold shares purchased on the open market or transferred from treasury shares to satisfy the future issue of shares under the Group's share option schemes. As at 31 December 2023 the QUEST had a net amount due from the Company of \u00a320.0m (2022: \u00a319.8m) and held 51,348 (2022: 57,216) shares transferred at a nil cost (2022: nil cost) with a market value of \u00a32.6m (2022: \u00a33.8m). As at 31 December 2023 there was no loan between the CIPEBT and the Company (2022: \u00a337.8m) following the loan being forgiven in 2023. The CIPEBT held 791 (2022: 688) shares transferred at a nil cost (2022: nil cost) with a market value of \u00a30.1m (2022: \u00a30.1m).\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 the AESOP had issued all its previously held shares, as financed by the Company, and thus had no residual loan balance with the Company. All of the shares held by the QUEST and CIPEBT were under option at 31 December 2023 and, except for a nominal amount, the right to receive dividends has been waived.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 the total number of treasury shares held was 2,901,442 (2022: 2,901,442) with a market value of \u00a3146.5m (2022: \u00a3199.3m).\n\n## 25.

Business combinations\n\n## 2023 Acquisition\n\nOn 4 July 2023 the Group successfully completed the acquisition of 100% share capital of Solus Biotech Co Ltd 'Solus', a global leader in premium, biotechnology-derived active ingredients for beauty care (Consumer Care sector) and pharmaceuticals (Life Sciences sector) employing 95 people in South Korea. The business was acquired for a total cash consideration of \u00a3227.4m. The acquisition provides access to Solus' existing biotech-derived ceramide and phospholipid technologies, and its emerging capabilities in natural retinol. This acquisition will significantly strengthen Croda's Beauty Actives portfolio and increases its exposure to targeted prestige segments. Located in South Korea, Solus expands Croda's Asian manufacturing capability and will create a new biotechnology R&D hub in the region. Post-acquisition the entity has changed its name to Croda Korea Ltd.\n\nAcquisition-related costs of \u00a39.6m have been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3nil).

These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## A. Accounting policies\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 ('FRS 100') issued by the Financial Reporting Council. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in compliance with the provisions of the Act and the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are provided in the Group financial statements of Croda International Plc.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial statements which appear on pages 195 to 200 have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquiries, including a review of forecasts, budgets and banking facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence.\n\n## Principal accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies which have been applied by the Company when preparing the financial statements are in accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101 is based on the recognition and measurement requirements of Adopted IFRSs, under which the Group financial statements have been prepared. As a result, the accounting policies of the Company are consistent with those used by the Group as presented on pages 157 to 163, except for those relating to the recognition and measurement of goodwill and the recognition of revenue, which are not directly relevant to the Company financial statements. Other Company specific policies include;\n\n- \u00b7 Investments are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Investments are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment, at which point the carrying value is reviewed against the underlying net assets or forecast cash generation of the entity.\n- \u00b7 Provisions against amounts owed by Group undertakings, based on lifetime expected losses, are not material.\n- \u00b7 The Company operates employee share trusts for the purpose of setting share-based payment arrangements. The Croda International Plc Employee Benefit Trust is treated as a branch of the Company with assets and liabilities accounted for as assets and liabilities of the Company.\n\nThe Group accounting policy for financial risk factors is also relevant to the preparation of the Company financial statements and is disclosed on pages 186 and 187.\n\n## B. Profit and loss account\n\nOf the Group's profit for the year, \u00a335.9m (2022: \u00a3505.9m) is included in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board on 26 February 2024 but which is not presented as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## C.

Post-retirement benefits\n\nIn line with the requirements of FRS 101, the Company recognises its share of the UK pension scheme assets, liabilities, income statement (charges)/credits and OCI movements based on the number of scheme members. A full reconciliation of the Group retirement benefit obligation can be found in note 11 of the Group financial statements on pages 171 to 175. The table below shows the movement in the obligation during the year.\n\n|                                      | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Opening balance:                     |            |            |\n| Assets                               | 41.2       | 56.5       |\n| Liabilities                          | (35.6)     | (55.7)     |\n| Net opening retirement benefit asset | 5.6        | 0.8        |\n| Movements in the year:               |            |            |\n| Service cost - current               | (0.4)      | (0.6)      |\n| Interest income                      | 0.3        | 0.1        |\n| Contributions                        | 1.4        | 1.5        |\n| Remeasurements                       | (1.8)      | 3.8        |\n| Closing balance                      | 5.1        | 5.6        |\n\n## L. Share-based payments\n\nThe total charge for the year in respect of share-based remuneration schemes was \u00a31.2m (2022: \u00a35.4m). The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.\n\nThe key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss account are set out in note 23 to the Group financial statements.\n\n## M. Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Company has guaranteed loan capital and bank overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to \u00a3179.4m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3153.5m).\n\n## N. Dividends\n\nDetails of dividends are disclosed in note 8 of the Group financial statements.\n\n## O. Related party transactions\n\nThe Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 from disclosing transactions with other Group undertakings. There were no other related party transactions during the year. Information on the Group can be found in note 26 on page 194 of the Group financial statements.\n\n2023",

Receiving corporate communications by email has a number of benefits including being more environmentally friendly, reducing unnecessary waste, faster notification of information to shareholders and a reduction in company costs.\n\nShareholders who register on the above website can also check their shareholding, view their dividend history, choose their dividend options, register changes of address and dividend mandate instructions.\n\n## Share price information\n\nThe latest ordinary share price is available on our website at www.croda.com.\n\nThe middle market values of the listed share capital at 31 December 2023, or last date traded*, were as follows:\n\nOrdinary shares\n\n5073p\n\n5.9% preference shares\n\n81p*\n\n6.6% preference shares\n\n94p*\n\n2023\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)\n\nOrdinary shareholders may wish to know about this plan, which allows you to use your dividends to buy further shares in Croda.

This means that:\n\n- \u00b7 your dividend reaches your bank account on the payment date;\n- \u00b7 it is more secure - cheques can sometimes get lost in the post;\n- \u00b7 you don't have the inconvenience of depositing a cheque; and\n- \u00b7 it helps reduce cheque fraud.\n\nIf you have a UK bank account you can sign up to this service on Signal Shares (www.signalshares.com) by clicking on 'your dividend options' and following the on-screen instructions or by contacting the Customer Support Centre.\n\n## Overseas shareholders - choose to receive your next dividend in your local currency\n\nIf you live outside the UK, Link has partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide you with a service that will convert Sterling dividends into your local currency at a competitive rate.\n\nYou can choose to receive payment directly to your local bank account or alternatively you can be sent a currency draft.

Fraudsters can be articulate and financially knowledgeable, with credible websites, testimonials and materials that are hard to distinguish from the real thing. If you have been contacted unexpectedly, or are suspicious about a call or text message, make sure you stop and check the warning signs.",

        "page_content": "## How to avoid scams\n\n- \u00b7 Treat all unexpected calls, emails and text messages, social media messages or even in person visits with caution. Don't assume they're genuine, even if the person seems to know some basic information about you.\n- \u00b7 Don't be pressured into acting quickly, hang up on calls and ignore messages if you feel pressured. A genuine bank or financial services firm won't mind waiting if you want time to think.\n- \u00b7 Never give out your bank account or credit card details unless you are certain who you are dealing with.\n- \u00b7 If you're buying a financial product such as a loan, insurance, investment or pension, only deal with an FCA-authorised firm - check the FS Register to see if the firm is registered. Always access the Register from the FCA website, rather than through links in emails or on a firm's website (it might be part of the scam).\n- \u00b7 Double-check the URL and contact details of a firm in case it's a 'clone firm' pretending to be a real firm, such as your bank or a genuine investment firm.\n- \u00b7 Check the list of unauthorised firms and individuals the FCA have received complaints about. If the firm isn't on their list, don't assume it's legitimate - it may not have been reported to them yet.\n- \u00b7 Check your bank account and credit card statements regularly.\n- \u00b7 Don't give access to your device by downloading software or an app from a source you don't trust. Scammers may be able to view, take control of your device and access your bank account.\n- \u00b7 Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more about investment scams.\n\nYou can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## Secretary and Registered Office\n\nTom Brophy (Company Secretary) Cowick Hall, Snaith, Goole, East Yorkshire DN14 9AA Tel: +44 (0)1405 860551 Fax: +44 (0)1405 861767 Website: www.croda.com\n\nRegistered in England number 206132\n\n## Registrars\n\nLink Group\n\nCentral Square, 29 Wellington Street, Leeds, LS1 4DL\n\nTel:\n\n0371 664 0300 (from UK) +44 (0) 371 664 0300 (from overseas)\n\nCalls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider.
