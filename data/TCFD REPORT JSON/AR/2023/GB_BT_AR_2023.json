        "page_content": "## Thank you to Philip\n\nAfter five years as Chief Executive of BT Group, Philip Jansen stood down at the end of January 2024. Philip achieved a huge amount during his time, most notably setting our vision to provide full fibre connections to 25m premises across the UK by December 2026 - a target we are well over halfway towards completing.\n\nPhilip's tenure was also marked by a number of exceptional external challenges. Covid-19 caused immediate changes to everyday life and lasting shifts in how businesses and society operate, and BT Group successfully adapted to both under Philip's leadership. He also steered the business through the impacts of events such as the cost-of-living crisis, high inflation rates and the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nI'd like to take the opportunity to again thank Philip personally, and on behalf of the Board, for everything he delivered for BT Group and the foundation he's set for our future success. I wish him all the best with his future endeavours.\n\n## Welcoming Allison\n\nIn February 2024, we welcomed Allison Kirkby as our new Chief Executive. She is a proven leader, with deep sector experience and a history of transforming businesses.\n\nHaving served as a member of our Board since 2019, Allison already has a full understanding of our long-term strategic objectives. On the following pages, she sets out how she's shaping this strategy to deliver for our customers and stakeholders better and faster.\n\nThis will be achieved by focusing on building and connecting customers to our networks, and accelerating the transformation of BT Group to improve our customer service and for the benefit of all our stakeholders. The Board and I look forward to supporting this agenda and Allison's leadership in her new executive capacity.\n\n## Moving beyond peak investment\n\nWe've steadily accelerated the delivery of our unprecedented investment programme, creating the UK's digital backbone and enabling growth in its economy and businesses. Building and connecting faster hastens the delivery of returns to our shareholders.\n\nFY24 is the year in which we passed the peak of our capital expenditure on this programme, enabling us to see greater normalised free cash flow over the coming years. This gives us confidence to increase the full year dividend to 8.0 pence per share while reaffirming our progressive dividend policy for our loyal investors.\n\n## Enabling better outcomes for the UK\n\nWhile change both inside and outside BT Group is now constant, our purpose endures: We Connect for Good. Our network investments, alongside our Manifesto commitments to deliver responsible, inclusive and sustainable technology, create a foundation for greater inclusivity and wider benefits to society.\n\nWe're committed to ensuring that the networks we provide, and the essential services they enable, are accessed and utilised as widely as possible across the UK. In 2021, we set an ambitious goal to reach 25m people in the UK with digital skills by March 2026, and we're on track to hit that target. We also continue to move forward on our wider sustainability goals, with a commitment to build towards a circular BT Group by the end of March 2030, and a circular tech ecosystem by end of March 2040.\n\nWe've continued to make clear progress on reducing our environmental impact, with a 61% reduction in operational carbon emissions intensity (compared to FY17 levels) - but we want to go further too, both in our own operations but also within the wider ecosystem we enable. That's why we've set a target to achieve net zero carbon emissions in our operations by the end of March 2031, and for supply chain and customer carbon emissions by the end of March 2041.\n\n## Engaging with our stakeholders\n\nThe massive investments we've been making, amid highly challenging economic conditions and constantly increasing data usage and demand, have created inflationary pressures on our business. This has an unavoidable impact on the prices we must charge our customers. We know these rises are never welcome, which is why it's critical that the rationale behind them is fully explained and understood.\n\nOur Consumer business was the first in the industry to incorporate Ofcom's latest proposals on pricing, moving to a 'pounds and pence' structure so that customers have a clear view of costs across their contracted period. We've also continued to protect our social tariff and pay as you go customers from price increases, to ensure everyone is able to remain online.\n\nWe're engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, including Ofcom, UK Government, the Digital Voice Advisory Board and Telecare Action Board, as we progress the switch from analogue to digital landlines. Along with other communications providers, we paused all non-voluntary migrations in December 2023, and we now expect to have migrated\n\nall customers off the public switched telephone network (PSTN) by the end of January 2027, allowing us to align the programme with full fibre broadband customer upgrades where available. This timescale will ensure we get this right while delivering this essential programme to ensure the long-term resilience of our networks and services.\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn January 2024 we welcomed Raphael K\u00fcbler, Chief Operating Officer at Deutsche Telekom, to our Board. Raphael replaced Adel Al-Saleh as Deutsche Telekom's nominated Board representative, and we look forward to working with him going forward.\n\nIn May of this year we also welcomed Tushar Morzaria to the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Tushar brings a wealth of strategic financial management experience gained over 25 years of overseeing transformation programmes and strengthening risk and control frameworks in complex global organisations.\n\nIan Cheshire and Iain Conn stepped down from the BT Group Board in July 2023, with Ruth Cairnie succeeding them in the roles of both Senior Independent NonExecutive Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nI'm confident that the collective expertise and varied backgrounds of our Board members mean we have the right range of skills and experience to progress BT Group's ambitions, while also meeting best practice and the guidelines set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nBT Group has made good progress in the last few years and yet we still have an enormous transformation ahead of us if we are to truly modernise the way we operate for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n\nWhile we've a long way to go, our strategy is beginning to deliver, creating the next generation networks that connect the UK, while seeing clear improvements in operational efficiency and financial returns.\n\nAs our investment expenditure reduces and as Allison's leadership brings renewed focus and accelerated delivery, I'm confident that the long-term prospects for BT Group are extremely strong.\n\n## Adam Crozier\n\nChairman 15 May 2024",

        "page_content": "## Sharpening our focus on being the best we can be for our customers, for our shareholders and for the UK.\n\n## Early reflections\n\nI've spent the last few months meeting as many of our customers and stakeholders as possible. Every interaction has confirmed to me that connectivity is the lifeblood of the UK's society and economy. We provide the digital backbone for the nation; without us, life as we know it stops. That might sound dramatic, but it's true and it's why everything we do has to be focused on supporting the customers who rely on us and living up to our purpose, to connect for good.\n\nI've now visited close to 20 BT Group sites in the UK to meet with colleagues across our operations, and it's been fantastic to see their commitment and passion for what we do. As they're the people who connect with our customers most often, hearing their perspectives on our strengths, opportunities and challenges has also been invaluable as I've shaped my thinking.\n\nThese conversations have deepened my appreciation of the fantastic assets that make us unique. We're unrivalled in our experience of operating critical national infrastructure, our breadth of private and public sector customer relationships, our research and development credentials, our partnerships with the world's leading technology firms, and above all our brilliant people who underpin everything we do.\n\nWe must harness these strengths as we move into the next phase of BT Group's transformation. We're over the peak of our investment in fibre-to-the-premises ('FTTP' or 'full fibre'); take-up of 5G and FTTP is growing; and we're seeing higher customer satisfaction across the business as our networks and services provide everimproving experiences. But we can and must go faster in utilising the full power of our networks. We'll do this by sharpening our focus on being the best we can be for our customers, for our shareholders and for the UK.\n\n## Our financial performance\n\nOver the past year we delivered a solid operating and financial performance, with growth in both adjusted revenue and EBITDA. We passed peak capex on our full fibre broadband rollout and achieved \u00a33bn of annualised cost savings a year ahead of schedule.\n\nThis means we've now reached the inflection point where we emerge from the most capital-intensive phase of our investment programme. It also gives us the confidence to provide new guidance that significantly increases our short-term cash flow and sets out a path to more than double our normalised free cash flow over the next five years. This enhanced cash flow allows us to increase our dividend for FY24 by 3.9% to 8.0 pence per share. We're also setting an additional \u00a33bn of gross annualised cost savings to be reached by the end of FY29.\n\nI know BT Group's share price has underperformed in recent years, but we now have a clear, positive path that aims to drive significant value for all stakeholders going forward.\n\n## Connecting the UK\n\nOur full fibre rollout has delivered the UK's largest private national infrastructure programme, on time and on budget. It will deliver huge benefits to the UK, with nationwide full fibre broadband predicted to increase national GDP by \u00a372bn  - or about 2% - by 2030.\n\nWe've built at record speed and efficiency this past year, with an additional 3.5m premises passed, taking us to 13.8m premises covered - equivalent to well over 40% of UK homes. In fact, we're currently the fastest builder of fibre anywhere in Europe, and at a lower cost than our major competitors in the UK. More importantly, we're also seeing industry-leading customer take up of our FTTP networks at 34% - and this is even stronger where we built two or more years ago, with take up of over 50%.\n\nHaving passed peak capex on our full fibre broadband rollout and achieved our \u00a33bn cost and service transformation programme a year ahead of schedule, we've now reached the inflection point on our long-term strategy.\n\nWe've continued our rollout of 5G, which now covers 75% of the UK population, and grown our 5G-ready customer base to 11m. Our overall mobile network has increased to 88% of the UK by geography, including new mobile connectivity in 33 London Underground stations. We're also the only network provider to have hit our Shared Rural Network commitment to Government, bringing mobile coverage to many parts of the country for the first time. The customer experience uplift is evident from the scale of traffic increase that we see when new locations are connected. In remote parts of Scotland, for example, we have seen this drive new commerce for businesses, enable people to use online services for the first time, and connect emergency services in the most remote locations.\n\nWe're not just providing brilliant fixed and mobile networks - we're also combining them with the key services our customers need to live, work, game and learn. For example, we launched EE Fibre 1.6Gbps, offering the fastest home broadband speeds of any major provider, and a new EE TV app and set-top box, fully integrated with Apple TV 4K. For businesses, we announced Global Fabric, which will enable organisations to seamlessly and securely connect to multiple clouds and seize the advantages of digital automation and artificial intelligence (AI), and we've also launched new customer solutions via collaborations with companies such as Google, SAP and Microsoft. These are reflected in strong customer satisfaction metrics across the business, and external accolades such as EE being named as RootMetrics' number 1 mobile network for the 21st time.",

        "page_content": "As we move into the next phase of BT Group's transformation, we are sharpening our focus to be better for our customers and the country, by accelerating the modernisation of our operations, and by exploring options to optimise our global business.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThis year's Annual Report provides many more examples of how our long-term strategy is delivering: we're building and connecting our customers to next generation networks at pace; we're creating standout customer experiences; and we're leading the way to a bright and sustainable future.\n\nWhile building our next generation IT and network infrastructure, we're proactively moving customers off legacy platforms that don't deliver the full benefits of digital connectivity. We recently completed the sunsetting of our 3G mobile network, and we're continuing to move customers onto digital IP-based services. We now expect to have completed this shift by January 2027.\n\nWe are also radically simplifying our product and customer journeys by partnering with leading technology players and responsibly adopting new technologies such as AI to enable customer benefits and business growth.\n\nIn October, we launched our new integrated EE digital platform to drive convergence. This included new connectivity propositions, building on our FTTP and 5G leadership, improved products and services and a simpler, better set of customer journeys. Overall this is driving a better customer experience, with those that have migrated showing a higher rate of convergence and NPS.\n\nOur strategy is delivering, and when BT Group wins, the UK wins. But the world around us is moving at pace, and so must we. I will set out more on this in the coming months, but I am already clear that my ambition for BT Group is to be the UK's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.\n\n## The digital opportunity for the UK\n\nHaving spent the last decade running telecoms companies in Scandinavia, I've seen first-hand how much more digital and connected those nations are. For example, Sweden's equivalent FTTP take-up rate is over 80%, and they have far greater adoption of the new services that this connectivity enables. Digital platforms are embedded and aligned across all aspects of everyday life, with online banking, payment, public services and healthcare apps used at much higher rates than in the UK.\n\nWhat I saw in Sweden is a clear example of how a better-connected society can unlock huge benefits for both governments and citizens. As well as reducing costs, bureaucracy, fraud and complexity, these digital services also have great potential to help society decarbonise, and to underpin the creation of new, technology-based models that empower businesses to compete in an increasingly digital, global marketplace.\n\nThat's why I'm committed to ensuring BT Group plays a key role in helping the UK catch up and realise the benefits of a fully connected society. This isn't something that's nice to do - it's critical to the UK's future.\n\nHaving made huge investments into UK infrastructure and services, we must ensure everyone now benefits from them. And all the right foundations are in place to enable this. As well as our own networks, we have regulatory stability, government policy that incentivises further investment, and strong competition spurring all of us in the industry to keep innovating.\n\nI know from my years of experience in the industry that the most successful telcos around the world are national champions who leverage their history, their assets and technology leadership to create value for all. Building on the progress we have made, and with the transformation of BT Group now accelerating, we are moving into a phase where the full potential of our brands, networks, products and services can be realised.  This will unlock benefits for UK citizens, businesses and the economy as a whole - and I personally can't wait to start delivering for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Allison Kirkby\n\nChief Executive 15 May 2024",

Tightly cooperating with them makes us more agile, and more focused on customers.\n\n## Leading networks at scale\n\nWe build, own and run the UK's largest fixed and mobile networks - covering both rural and urban areas.\n\nOur fixed network connects homes and businesses at speeds of up to 1800Mbps. And we're also building the UK's new digital infrastructure to provide even better connectivity for all. With the fastest build rate in Europe, more than 13.8m premises have now been passed with full fibre.\n\nWe're continuing to grow our mobile network too. Our strong position on spectrum holdings and access to base station infrastructure has helped our 4G network cover over 99% of the population and 5G reach more than 75%.\n\n## R&D and innovation\n\nInnovation has always been the key to our success - keeping us out in front in a constantly changing world.\n\nThis year we recognised \u00a3726m on R&D. We also filed 95 patent applications, bringing our portfolio to 5,385.\n\nOpenreach continues to push innovation boundaries to help cut build and maintenance costs while improving network quality.

There's more investment in fixed and mobile markets. New entrants are speeding up disruptive trends - like the blurring of boundaries between connectivity and digital services.\n\n## Economic uncertainty\n\nToday there is widespread economic uncertainty because of inflation and high interest rates.

That means creating market-leading service, brilliant digital touchpoints and trustworthy, secure and tailored experiences.\n\nCustomers don't buy products; they buy answers to problems.

We want our solutions to create value for our home and business customers and give them the outcomes they need.\n\nWe're building value through commercial excellence - with superior sales effectiveness and better marketing and pricing capabilities.\n\n## Pillar 3: Lead the way to a bright sustainable future\n\nWe're setting up our corporate portfolio for growth. That means optimising our assets, investments and picking our partners carefully.\n\nThe best new technologies will help us to grow sustainably. Our assets, capabilities and expertise should drive profitable growth and create brilliant outcomes for our customers and country.\n\nWe're creating a more responsible, inclusive and sustainable business. That means investing in digital skills, championing responsible technology and tackling climate challenges and inequality.\n\nWe're building trusted relationships with our stakeholders.

So, our people strategy aims to make BT Group a brilliant place to work. We've made progress and achieved a lot, but there is more to do.\n\n## A culture where people can be their best\n\n## Skills and organisational development\n\n- - Today's work landscape is always changing. Giving colleagues new skills doesn't only benefit them, it's essential for our success:\n- - We've introduced My Campus - a new AI-driven learning platform for personalised learning experiences. This year, we achieved a very promising early adoption rate of 42% among colleagues that have participated in learning via the platform.\n- - We're also empowering our software engineers through new technologies like Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered coding assistant.\n\n## Inclusion, equity and diversity:\n\n- - A workforce as diverse as our customer base, and inclusion by design are critical to our strategy and will help us drive productivity, innovation and growth for the UK and beyond.\n- - We've made progress against our diversity goals but it's not yet enough; we are committed to improvement because we know inclusion and diversity enable company performance (see page 31).\n- - Important foundations are in place; we have a strong community of People Networks and partners like 10,000 Black Interns and CyberFirst.\n- - And our hard work didn't go unnoticed as the BT Group Ethnic Diversity Network was awarded 'Best Network Group' at the Ethnicity Awards.\n- - Our data and surveys tell us that colleagues from under-represented groups are experiencing barriers and non-inclusive behaviours.\n- - Our Inclusion Plan aims to remove the barriers and improve the capability of our people managers to lead their teams inclusively (see page 31).\n\n## Occupational health and wellbeing\n\n- - Colleague engagement is still higher than external UK benchmarks. Following our March 2024 Your Say colleague engagement survey, it improved by 2 points to 75% compared to last year. This has been driven mainly by Openreach.\n- - All UK colleagues had a minimum of a 5.5% pay rise. Our junior frontline colleagues got bigger pay rises of up to 10%.\n- - Our Better Workplace programme is transforming BT Group workspaces. Since the programme started, we've closed 746 older buildings and moved over 22,000 colleagues to new facilities.\n\n## 42%\n\nThis year, we achieved a very promising early adoption rate of 42% among colleagues that have participated in learning via the My Campus platform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEngineers trained this year in new fibre skills.",

These evolutions also give them the latest converged, intelligent connectivity solutions to get more from their digital lives.\n\n- - Many customers are hanging onto their phones for longer. So we introduced 'Flex plans'. The new service separates handsets and connection payments so customers can choose to pay off their phones over longer periods.\n- - We launched 'New EE' - a modern digital platform giving customers a broader range of products and more options on payments, technology and subscription management.\n- - 'New EE' is powered by an EE ID identity management system. Anyone in the UK can create an EE ID and buy products and services without having to be an EE customer. The EE ID user base exceeds 9.5m customers.\n- - We've introduced EE TV - a complete service of flexible premium content. This UK first features an Apple TV 4K app and a free multi-room option.\n- - Our new Smart Hub gives full fibre speed of 1.6Gbps and includes mobile back-up and next-generation wi-fi controls to make sure they're always connected.\n- - For business customers, we announced Global Fabric. This brand-new cloudready global network is flexible, scalable and offers pay-as-you-use connectivity - to help them get the best from a multi-cloud environment.\n- - With cyber security company Fortinet we're providing a new networking and security service to help businesses manage multi-site connections.

This will deliver better, smarter outcomes for customers.\n\n- - Our Adastral Park R&D centre continues innovating around network technology. Our experts are pioneering the next generation of communications capabilities to help transform how people live and work.\n- - The Adastral Park team also developed Multicast Assisted Unicast Delivery. It delivers more reliable, better-quality online video streaming - while cutting energy and bandwidth use during peak events by over 50%.\n- - In East Lothian we're piloting the UK's first Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers powered by our street cabinets. This could revolutionise EV charging across the country.\n- - Our remote healthcare solution uses a patient app to give them early access to health monitoring, resources to manage their conditions and instant remote access to clinicians. We're currently piloting it in 26 GP practices.\n\n## A responsible, inclusive, sustainable business\n\nOur Manifesto describes our long-term commitments to contributing positively to country and community.\n\n- - We're creating a more inclusive society to help drive UK productivity, innovation and growth:\n- - This year we helped 3.7m people and more than 200,000 business owners and employees, improve their digital skills - a total of 23m people helped since FY15 (see page 35).\n- - We partnered with AbilityNet to help around 3,000 digitally excluded over-65s build confidence and skills through various campaigns including a series of free 'BTea Room' digital workshops.\n- - To support small business customers we organised 120 Netwalks. This initiative provides self-care, mental health support, early intervention and networking opportunities to small businesses.\n- - Over 80% of UK children play games online at least a few times a week. So we launched an online resource called 'GameSmart' to give parents safety tips for managing children's gaming without being overly restrictive.\n- - We created EE Hope United to combat online hate. This year we lobbied the House of Lords to amend the Online Safety Bill to better protect women and girls.\n- - We're pushing further to become a net zero carbon emissions business by March 2031:\n- - We've cut our carbon emissions intensity by 61% since FY17. And our transition from copper to full fibre networks will speed up our carbon emissions cuts - as fibre is 80% more energy efficient than copper.\n- - We're also switching our commercial fleet to EVs. We added more than 1,700 EVs to the fleet this year, bringing the total to over 4,100.\n- - This year we cut our global energy consumption by 140GWh - a 4% drop.\n- - Our customers avoided more than 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions this year through our products and services, including full fibre broadband.\n- - Openreach brought full fibre broadband to Fair Isle, one of the UK's most geographically remote islands. To avoid protected landscapes and bird nesting season, they had to reroute the build by 100km. That's the longest continuous fibre transmission distance ever deployed in the UK.\n\n## 3.7 m\n\nThis year we helped 3.7m people and over 200,000 small business owners and their employees improve their digital skills.",

Roughly 8,000 were in the UK, including around 1,000 apprentices and 200 graduates.\n\nRoughly 17,000 colleagues left the business around 14,000 through natural attrition and 2,000 through paid leaver programmes.\n\n## Building tomorrow's skills and capabilities\n\nAs our business evolves, so too will the skills and capabilities we need - resulting in a smaller, but more skilled, diverse and tech-savvy future team.\n\nWe're now clear on what's needed to deliver on the workforce reduction targets we announced in May 2023, and to make the right changes to our mix of skills.\n\n## Safer and more inclusive leadership\n\nBuilding an inclusive environment starts with our leaders. This year we launched a 10month learning programme for our senior leaders to build more inclusive leadership practices, with 87% enrolled so far.\n\nThe programme focuses on creating an inclusive climate, building psychological safety, developing a sense of belonging\n\nand learning how to have conversations about inclusion. The training is also helping build the right habits and better accountability - with tools for leaders to apply what they've learned with their teams.\n\n## BT Business school\n\nWe created and ran a CEO-sponsored mini-MBA style programme for senior leaders in our Business unit. It helped our senior management team build a stronger community, fill in skills and knowledge gaps around effective commercial leadership and address cultural challenges.\n\n## Talent attraction, inclusion, equity and diversity\n\nWe partnered with Women Returners on the 'Restart' project to attract and retain career returners. The widespread social media campaign generated significant interest and resulted in over 300 applications for 18 places.\n\nLaunched in September 2023, our 'Business as Unusual' campaign aimed to disrupt the market around hiring talent. It generated significant social media interest which helped us find 202 talented people, identify 24 exceptionally talented people for future hire, and hire eight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the campaign we also got an overall increase in job applications. September 2023 saw the year's highest number of applicants (a 26% uplift vs August). We had more external applications from women, and overall women external hires in the UK also rose to 45% in September and October last year.\n\nEE's attraction programme kicked off in 2023. Aiming to reach a more diverse audience, it included a new EE brand campaign, industry partnerships and new candidate profiles.\n\nWe're already seeing a positive impact in terms of colleague retention. We also hired more apprentices than last year with recent cohorts 8% more likely to stay at least three months compared to our normal hiring process.\n\n## My Campus - a personal learning platform\n\nUpskilling and reskilling colleagues across the group will boost our performance and help transformation happen. Making learning easier and more habitual gives us the best chance of giving our colleagues the right skills for the future.\n\nEthnic diversity is based on voluntary disclosure.

Our UK gender pay gap is broadly the same as last year - we continue to track lower than the national average gender pay gaps:\n\n- - Our median gender pay gap narrowed slightly to 5.6% (-0.5%).\n- - Our mean gender pay gap widened slightly to 4.0% (+0.3%).\n\n## Median pay gap %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Our gender gap is still lower than the UK average of 14.3% (median) and 13.2% (mean) and our female representation in the upper pay quarter has improved.\n- - Despite an increase in female hires between 2022 and 2023, female representation remains unbalanced at 23%, with a higher attrition rate among women. This is reflected in the pay quartile distribution, with a higher proportion of women in lower pay quartiles and little improvement in the upper pay quartiles.\n- You can read our full statement including all the entities in scope at bt.com/genderpaygap\n\n## Ethnicity\n\nThis is the fourth year we've voluntarily reported our ethnicity pay gap (which is not a legal requirement).\n\n## Ethnicity pay gap %\n\n|                  | 2023   | 2023          | 2022   | 2022          |\n|------------------|--------|---------------|--------|---------------|\n|                  | Mean   | Median        | Mean   | Median        |\n| Ethnic  minority |        | (0.8)% (1.8)% |        | (0.3)% (1.2)% |\n| Asian            |        | (3.4)% (2.9)% |        | (3.6)% (2.4)% |\n| Black            |        | 5.1% (0.9)%   |        | 6.6% (0.3)%   |\n| Multi- ethnic    | 0.1%   | 4.0%          | 3.3%   | 5.2%          |\n| Other  ethnic    |        | (3.7)% (8.7)% |        | (6.2)% (9.3)% |\n\n## Ethnicity bonus gap %\n\n|                  | 2023    | 2023          | 2022   | 2022         |\n|------------------|---------|---------------|--------|--------------|\n|                  | Mean    | Median        | Mean   | Median       |\n| Ethnic  minority | 7.4%    | 4.2%          | 8.4%   | 14.2%        |\n| Asian            | 4.2%    | 2.5%          | (2.1)% | 1.3%         |\n| Black            | 41.4%   | 11.9%         | 37.7%  | 53.9%        |\n| Multi- ethnic    | (27.7)% | 2.3%          |        | 0.7% (14.9)% |\n| Other  ethnic    |         | (6.0)% (3.5)% | (1.5)% | 40.1%        |\n\nEthnic diversity is based on voluntary disclosure. In 2023, 77% of UK colleagues disclosed their ethnicity.\n\nAggregated ethnicity pay gap analyses can often mask wider issues that people of different ethnicities face at work and in society. So each year we look at our data very carefully to get a more nuanced picture.\n\nIn 2023 ethnicity pay gaps stayed low and favourable - with an overall median pay gap of -1.8% and a mean of -0.8%. But they do vary by different ethnic group.\n\nThe figures above detail the movement in pay and bonus gaps to the majority by ethnic group from FY23 to FY24.\n\n- - The Black/African/Caribbean/Black British mean pay gap is still largest of all the ethnic groups - although it did narrow slightly this year and the Asian pay gap is the narrowest. This is reflected in the fact there are more Asian colleagues in higher-paid roles like management, and more Black colleagues in frontline roles like engineering.\n\n## Disability\n\nThis is the first year we've voluntarily reported our disability pay gap (which is not a legal requirement). It reflects our drive for equal opportunity across all characteristics.\n\nDisability is based on voluntary disclosure. At the time of the snapshot date in April 2023, 68% of UK colleagues disclosed their disability status. Improving this rate is the biggest lever to help us understand and improve our disability pay gap.\n\n|       | 2023   | 2023   |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n|       | Mean   | Median |\n| Pay   | 0.7%   | 0.0%   |\n| Bonus | (6.5)% | (0.2)% |\n\n- - At group level, mean and median pay gaps are low - with a small mean gap of 0.7% and a zero median gap.\n- - The overall bonus gap is negative. This shows our disabled employees getting slightly higher bonuses - influenced by the higher declaration rate in our senior leader population.\n- You can find more examples of BT Group's initiatives to improve representation (as well as pay quartile analysis, bonus information and entity breakdowns) in our ESG Addendum at bt.com/esgaddendum\n\n## Inclusive health\n\nWe know how inclusive health affects our workforce and colleagues - so we listen to our People Networks closely. We partnered with our:\n\n- - Ethnic Diversity Network around mental health care disparities and to enhance our mental health services.\n- - Able2 Network on matters like occupational health, BT passports, living with disabilities and mental health.\n- - Jewish and Muslim Networks on coping with the impact of the situation in Israel and Gaza.\n- - Gender Equality, Carers, Pride, Peer to Peer Support and Armed Forces Networks on topics like cancer and suicide prevention.\n- - Carers Network to apply for Carer Confident Level 3 - Ambassador Status (The Employers for Carers Benchmarking Scheme).\n\n## Adjustments for everyone who needs them\n\nWe're committed to making sure any colleague who needs a workplace adjustment gets one. These are positive adaptations which help colleagues with a disability, health condition or change in personal circumstances that might stop them working at their full potential.",

Using empowER to raise cases for each referral provides Managers with a guided journey to follow and each case is supported by HR Services.\n\n## Occupational health and wellbeing\n\nAbsences across BT Group from sickness fell to an average of 3.67% calendar days lost per colleague (down from 3.87% last year).\n\nAnd when our colleagues need extra help getting back to work, our fully funded rehabilitation programme for musculoskeletal and mental health services returns 97% of them to full duties.\n\n## Better mental and physical health\n\nToday's world is psychologically challenging. In a Volatile Uncertain Complex Ambiguous world we continue to be at the forefront of innovative approaches to improve the wellbeing of our colleagues and help them maintain optimum mental health. We continue to promote our Employee Assistance Programme and CBT Mental Health Service as well as online guided self help modules.\n\nIn FY24 we started the process of getting BSI ISO 45003 certification for psychological health and safety in the workplace. We achieved the stage 1 audit objectives and the BSI auditor has recommended we now move to stage 2 audits.\n\nAs well as strengthening our fitness for work medicals for our most critical roles, we continue to do statutory health surveillance for all our poling and civil engineers.\n\n## Putting musculoskeletal health and safety first\n\nWe've been getting more sophisticated insights from our health and safety data. We have moved from reactive use of data to earlier and more active intervention.\n\n## Taking care of our team\n\nRunning the 999 emergency service\n\nWe are the first, calming voice heard every time someone in the UK calls the 999 emergency services. In FY24 we took 41 million calls - answering on average in less than a second.\n\nIn 2023, we reviewed our attendance rules for the 999 service. Our aim was to make shift patterns fairer and more consistent. The changes we're making include 'bunched' days off and a guaranteed weekend off every month. These will make our colleagues' shift schedules more predictable and structured, while allowing more flexibility and making it easier for them to plan around their working weeks.\n\n## 1,000 +\n\nTo help out teams across the whole group, this year we launched My EV - our electric vehicle salary sacrifice scheme, which generated more than 1,000 applications in the first week.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3139,000\n\nIntroduction of My Discounts - new discount scheme for colleagues. Almost \u00a3139,000 worth of savings for colleagues in the first four months.\n\nThe insights are helping us understand where to best focus our attention to make sure everyone at BT Group can work safely, and return home safe at the end of the day. Earlier intervention helps people stay in (or return to) work after injury or illness helping work become more of a part of the rehabilitation process.\n\nIn response to rising musculoskeletal related absences in our Openreach field engineering colleagues, using a data led, evidence-based approach we launched two new clinical intervention pilots this year to optimise colleagues' health - the Musculoskeletal Specialist Assessment and Medical Assistance Programme.\n\nThey include structured pathways to clinical support services, earlier categorisation based on the risk of long term sickness absence, and help for people to return to contractual work.\n\nIn FY24 we reduced musculoskeletalrelated absences by around 24,000 days equating to \u00a3500,000 in savings.",

They help us consider how to minimise harm and benefit people every time we develop, buy, use or sell tech. They're grounded in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and are part of our risk management framework.\n\n## Our responsible tech principles are:\n\nFor Good: We design and deliver tech to empower people and improve their lives. Accountable: We're accountable for our actions and take care to avoid, and protect against, tech misuse.\n\nFair: We work hard to ensure everyone is treated fairly and with respect.\n\nOpen : We listen, collaborate and are transparent about our actions.\n\nOur Responsible Tech and Human Rights Sub-Committee oversees how we implement the principles. This year it continued looking at emerging risks and strategic growth areas. We used external experts to help define our approach on topics like high-risk markets, AI and new products and innovation.\n\n## Developing new tech\n\nWe apply the principles right from the start when we design and develop new tech. This year we:\n\n- - completed a human rights impact assessment of wi-fi controls to help us identify, understand and assess the risks of the product\n- - conducted user research to understand how our responsible tech principles could build trust and differentiate us\n- - published our approach to children's digital rights.\n\n## Buying tech\n\nOur procurement company, BT Sourced, has responsibility and sustainability criteria set into its processes. They give our buyers clarity on supplier risks and opportunities. This year we:\n\n- - reviewed human rights risks in our supply chain, to better understand these risks and identify any gaps in our policies and processes\n- - launched a 'worker's voice' pilot in five supplier factories, to understand the experience of people working in our supply chain\n- - carried on doing due diligence on our direct tier 1 manufacturing supply chain (visit bt.com/modernslavery for more).\n\n## Using tech\n\nWe want to make sure our products and services are used for good. So we focus on protecting privacy and free expression and preventing online harms.\n\nThis year we published an AI standard for colleagues, to ensure our use, development, purchase and sale of AI is consistent with the responsible tech principles, thereby helping to reduce risk at every stage of the AI life cycle.\n\n## Selling tech\n\nWe sell to customers around the world. This year we:\n\n- - enhanced sales due diligence in Business by adding checks for negative media coverage. This helps us assess any potential human rights risks through the life of a customer's contract\n- - conducted a human rights impact assessment in a high-risk country, which we'll use to steer future business strategy.\n\nThe 2023 Global Child Forum Benchmark Report looked at companies' policies, approach and commitment to children's rights. It rated BT Group as one of Europe's top performing companies and as a global leader in the telecoms sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEE GameSmart helps demystify the world of gaming for parents, helping you to create positive shared experiences with your children. With game trailers, information and guides, parents feel ready to embrace the world of gaming.

We want to be champions for digital inclusion too.\n\nMany families and vulnerable groups have been badly hit by the cost of living increases of recent years. We want to support them.\n\nWe're market leader in social tariffs, currently helping around 1m low-income and vulnerable customers through affordable fibre broadband and calls. And we've frozen these tariffs this year to protect them from inflationary price rises.\n\nOur Home Essentials social tariff gives discounted broadband to customers on Universal Credit. Our EE Basics tariff does similar for eligible mobile customers. And Openreach's 'Connect the Unconnected' scheme waives connection fees for vulnerable customers, via their CP.\n\nWorking with charity partner Home-Start UK, we're also supporting the most socially excluded households through gift-in-kind contributions, fundraising and donations, which totalled more than \u00a3134,000 this year. And our digital skills help is giving more people the benefits of being online particularly vulnerable groups in society, like children and over-65s.\n\nWe're developing the right digital infrastructure so no one gets left behind. Our full fibre broadband already passes 13.8m homes and businesses, including 3.9m in rural areas. Our 4G mobile network reaches 99% of the UK population, while our 5G network now reaches 75%, as we continue the rollout of 5G across the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- You can read more on page 20.\n\n## Help with digital skills\n\nThis year we helped 3.7m more UK people and businesses improve their digital skills. Since FY15, the total is 23m people. And we're on track to hit our target of 25m by the end of FY26.\n\n## Tackling online hate\n\nHope United is part of EE's ongoing commitment to deliver positive societal change. It features a team of elite professional football players representing all four home nations coming together to tackle online hate.\n\nSo far, it's helped educate 10.9m people on being good digital citizens.",

One of the EE Hope United squad also visited 10 Downing Street to support amendments to the Online Safety Bill, helping to protect women and girls.\n\n## Supporting small businesses\n\nOur free digital skills programme helps businesses unlock their potential. This year we reached 200,000 more business owners and employees. We gave them:\n\n- - help on everything from digital marketing and social media to GenAI via our LinkedIn Live webinar series with partner Upskill\n- - practical tips and advice from successful entrepreneurs through our 'Let's Talk About' video series\n- - access to live webinars, recordings and in-person mentoring through our partnership with the National Startup and Great British Entrepreneur Awards\n- - a UK-wide tour, webinars and mentoring sessions (working with Small Business Britain).\n\n## Employability and digital skills for young people\n\nWe're bridging the gap between education and employment by making sure children and young people are part of the UK's digital skills agenda.\n\nOver 1,000 secondary school children from disadvantaged backgrounds came to our 'Get Work Ready' days at our UK workplaces. The days gave a window into the types of STEM roles and skills needed in modern business - linking what they were learning at school to the skills employers look for.\n\nWith the national STEM Learning Centre and seven state schools in the Bristol Education Partnership, we helped launch the ENTHUSE programme. It supports teachers with essential continuous professional development and industry insights - and with workplace events to inspire students to consider roles in data, digital, engineering, innovation and technology.\n\nWe're lead sponsor of the FastFutures programme to promote and grow digital talent in support of the Government's skills agenda. Partnering with Avado and other businesses, we're helping a diverse range of 18-24 year olds get into digital roles. So far, we've helped over 7,400 young people build their networks, get experience and accelerate their careers. We're currently funding two cohorts - a total of 500 learners on a Digital Analyst Boot Camp. Eightyseven BT Group colleagues were actively involved in mentoring 138 learners this year.\n\nWe also support the National Cyber Security Centre's CyberFirst programme. Aiming to encourage school pupils into cyber and tech careers, the programme hosted events for more than 2,000 pupils last year.\n\nAnd it's our 24th year organising and sponsoring the BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition, which is now one of Europe's leading science and technology exhibitions, celebrating STEM research and innovation. This year's event included 550 projects from more than 1,100 students from 219 schools across Ireland.\n\n## Child online safety\n\nWe're helping to protect children online through a number of initiatives. This year we:\n\n- - relaunched PhoneSmart with better new functionality to help minimise online harm risks, as more and more youngsters own mobile phones\n- - launched GameSmart - featuring online safety information for parents on their child's use of games and gaming devices\n- - ran a campaign with Internet Matters for parents of under-fives on healthy technology use\n- - launched an online safety hub on the Internet Matters website.\n\n## Senior skills\n\nWe have a long-standing history of helping UK citizens learn new digital skills. But today 7% of the population are still offline.\n\nOlder people are one of the key groups in this population. They're also more likely to suffer from social isolation, worries around living costs and losing their landline in the Digital Voice switchover.\n\nSo far, in partnership with AbilityNet, we've helped around 3,000 digitally excluded over-65s build their confidence and develop digital skills. Together, we ran several 'BTea Room' sessions across the UK this year. Hosted in cafes, these free digital skills workshops covered a range of skills - from getting started with devices, to social media and staying safe online.\n\nWe teamed up with lexicographer Susie Dent to create a Digital Dictionary. It breaks down common digital terms that younger people take for granted but that are often confusing for older people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn today's digital age, many essential tasks require internet access, yet 22% of seniors still do not use the internet. To bridge this gap, BT Group partnered with AbilityNet to offer tailored digital training for those aged 65 and above, boosting their skills and confidence online while promoting safety awareness.\n\n- Read more at bt.com/seniorskills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd we've also been targeting the networks of older and digitally excluded people to encourage them to help get their loved ones more online.\n\n## India skills partnership\n\nSince 2019, BT India, with partner the British Asian Trust, has helped around 1.1m young people with digital skills, STEM career guidance and job opportunities. This year they launched an Outdoor School for Girls, which will provide digital, life, sustainability and entrepreneurial skills to 180,000 girls over the next three years.\n\nWith our support, education company Katha is working with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to teach more than 4,000 girls, through setting up robotics labs, refurbishing IT labs and training teachers.",

We've been 'A' rated on climate by CDP for the past eight years running. But as the climate crisis worsens, we all need to speed up the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nThis year we refreshed our Carbon Reduction Plan. It provides stakeholders with a clear view of the actions we're taking to shift BT Group and our value chain to a net zero economy.\n\nWe'll be net zero for our operations by the end of March 2031 - and for our full value chain by the end of March 2041. We also aim to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of CO2e and build towards being a circular business by the end of March 2030.\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions in our operations\n\nWe've cut our carbon emissions intensity by 61%. This is against our science-based target of an 87% cut by the end of March 2031 (compared to FY17 levels).\n\nAll of the electricity we purchase to power our buildings estate, shops and networks worldwide is certified as renewable a through our procurement of energy from sources that include power purchase agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs, supported by renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\nLong term renewable PPAs met 24% of our UK electricity demand this year, supporting additional renewable electricity infrastructure across the UK grid. Where we don't control the supply of electricity or where we can't guarantee the origin of the electricity, we purchase additional RECs to cover the proportion of our consumption (for example, at landlord controlled sites).\n\nWe have more to do to get to net zero. But we know how to get there - by electrifying our vehicle fleet, decarbonising our estate and building more energy-efficient networks.\n\n## Switching our vehicle fleet to electric\n\nNearly 80% of our operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) come from our commercial fleet of over 33,000 vehicles.\n\nWe're working hard and investing to convert the majority of this fleet to electric or zero emission vehicles by the end of FY31. In total we have over 4,100 electric vehicles (EVs) in our fleet, including more than 1,700 that we added this year.\n\nAs a founding member of the UK Electric Fleets Coalition, we'll keep on pushing for policy measures to drive a UK EV switch. This year, the coalition published a new document to encourage more policy momentum on EVs.\n\nOur start-up and digital incubation arm, Etc., has developed an EV charging unit built from a street cabinet (traditionally used to store broadband and phone cabling). We're exploring the potential to turn up to 60,000 cabinets into EV charging points. This would increase the availability of charging infrastructure on the UK's roads and support Government sustainability targets and plans to decarbonise the UK transport system.\n\nThis year, we introduced a salary-sacrifice scheme for UK colleagues to buy EVs through personal lease arrangements. And for colleagues in India, we're introducing EVs as part of our transport and shuttle passenger services. Today there are 94 EVs in use and we'll keep growing that number.\n\n## Decarbonising our buildings\n\nWe cut our global energy consumption by around 140GWh this year - a 4% drop on FY23. This was mainly achieved through rationalising and upgrading our buildings and networks, and reducing our fuel consumption as we continue to migrate our fleet to EVs.\n\nOur Better Workplace Programme is consolidating hundreds of BT Group buildings to around 30. The new or refurbished buildings have environmental impact firmly in mind. New builds meet the BREEAM b - Excellent standard.\n\n## A rated\n\nA rated on climate by CDP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn total we have over 4,100 EVs in our fleet.",

        "page_content": "## Our Manifesto continued\n\n## Building energy-efficient networks\n\nWe're building more energy-efficient fixed and 4G/5G networks, while switching off our old legacy ones. As well as saving energy, full fibre networks are better at handling the effects of physical risks like flooding and higher temperatures. That means fewer faults or engineering visits.\n\n## Cutting carbon emissions across our value chain\n\nOur Scope 3 carbon emissions account for 95% of our overall emissions. They come mainly from purchased goods in our supply chain and from customers using our products and services.\n\nSince FY17, we've cut our Scope 3 net emissions by 26%, to 3,000,873 tonnes of CO2e this year. This is a decrease of around 4% on FY23.\n\n## Helping suppliers cut carbon\n\nWe'll keep working with suppliers on cutting carbon. We've cut supply chain emissions by 25% since FY17. Our target is a 42% reduction by the end of March 2031.\n\nThis year, we've refreshed our climate change policy, which forms part of our expectations and generic standards applicable to suppliers working with us. It requires them to conduct climate risk assessments, set 1.5\u00baC aligned sciencebased targets and to report on progress annually. And we continue to engage with key suppliers on carbon reduction through contract clauses, for example, we've seen savings from Circet that reduced over 100t CO2e in 2023 under its contract with BT Group and Openreach.\n\nAlso this year we:\n\n- - launched a campaign asking suppliers to set 1.5\u00b0C aligned science-based targets, make them public and report on progress annually\n- - encouraged more key suppliers to report to CDP to improve visibility and action on emissions. Today, over 300 of them are doing that\n- - continued working with the Exponential Roadmap Initiative and 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders to drive climate action across global supply chains - while supporting small and medium-sized enterprises through the SME Climate Hub and UK Business Climate Hub\n- - joined the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR) Board of Directors. It's an association of 27 communications providers working together to sustainably transform supply chains across the ICT sector.\n\n## Cutting our customers' carbon\n\nThere's huge potential to use our networks, products and services to help customers cut their emissions - for example through decarbonising the grid and improving our products' energy efficiency.\n\nWe'll help customers avoid 60m tonnes of carbon by the end of March 2030 - which they'll do through technologies like full fibre broadband, mobile solutions and cloud computing. This year we:\n\n- - helped customers avoid more than 1.5m tonnes of carbon (nearly 3.8m tonnes in total since 2021), mainly through our full fibre rollout that enables reductions in personal or work-related travel\n- - published a new carbon abatement methodology, to be transparent on how we calculate savings (bt.com/carbonabatement)\n- - expanded our Digital Carbon Calculator to include compute and end point devices. The calculator helps our larger customers measure, track and cut carbon footprints across their networks. Today, it shows customers are cutting their CO2e by 15% on average when transforming their networks with us\n- - enhanced our Carbon Network Dashboard to include an energy optimisation recommendation feature, which helps our larger customers use their networks more efficiently. It enables them to measure, monitor and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions\n- - hosted a Sustainability Festival at Adastral Park. More than 1,100 people came, including big customers, climateleaders, start-ups and BT Group representatives. The event showcased cutting-edge technologies and how to drive sustainability and achieve net zero emissions in various industries.\n\n## Circularity\n\nDeveloping a circular economy is vital for achieving a net zero world. Around 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from material use and handling a .\n\nWe want to build towards being a circular business by 2030, and a circular tech ecosystem by 2040.\n\n## Products & Services\n\nThis year, we collected nearly 2.6m devices from consumers and businesses through our returns and take back processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis year, we converted over 94,000 surplus BT Smart Hub 2 into Plusnet Hub 2 routers, instead of making new routers, which usually creates a lot of carbon emissions.\n\nThis effort saved around 3,900 tonnes of CO2e.\n\nBy reusing all the electronics from the Smart Hub 2, we prevented over 80,000 kilograms of new electronics from being produced.\n\n- Read more at bt.com/ annualreview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncut in our energy use this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunched a new supplier engagement campaign asking our suppliers to set 1.5\u00b0C aligned science-based targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe've set a target to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of carbon by the end of March 2030.",

        "page_content": "Through our EE Trade-In service we collected 166,000 mobile devices, pushing past the milestone of 1m devices traded in since its launch. For FY24, 96% of collected devices went for reuse and a second life. The rest we recycled responsibly. For distributed mobile devices our take back rate is 5%. We want to increase this to at least 20% by 2030.\n\nFor 2023, our return rate for customer premises equipment was 67%. Our target is a 75% return rate by FY26 a . Customers returned over 2.36m hubs and set-top boxes. Through our refurbishment process, we reused 71% and recycled the rest. We also began scaling up refurbishment of our business hubs.\n\nTo extend the lives of our customers' devices, our EE repair service (approved by Apple, Samsung and Google) fixed 58,000 devices this year (up 94% on FY23).\n\nTo measure circularity in a more integrated way, we've started a pilot using the Circular Transition Indicator Tool on some of our own brand consumer devices. We're now reviewing the inflows and outflows of those devices. We aim to expand the pilot to other business areas to implement a common measurement approach.\n\n## Operational waste - our networks and estate\n\nWe want to put zero waste into landfill by 2030. That means increasing the number of things we reuse and recycle. Globally, we generated 69,000 tonnes of operational waste this year - 14% less than in FY23. Our UK recycling, reuse and recovery rate was 92.1% (90.4% globally).\n\nAs part of modernising our network, we continued recovering old or end-of-life network equipment to reuse or recycle, much of which was through our Exchange Clearance Operations programme. This year, we recovered 3,300 tonnes. We also agreed a deal with a leading bank and global recycler EMR to support the extraction and recycling of copper cable from our network until 2028.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWe continued working to understand our impacts on nature and biodiversity, in line with the draft Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework. This year, we ran an impact assessment of our operations and procurement.\n\nAs part of our focus on conservation, BT Group has partnered with The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. We provide financial contributions to the charity and volunteering opportunities for colleagues.\n\nOpenreach created a Business Conservation Partnership with the RSPB, to make sure that, moving forward, they are better placed to implement naturepositive actions as part of the overall fibre build programme.\n\nOpenreach has also worked closely with NatureScot and National Trust for Scotland in providing fibre to Fair Isle (between Orkney and Shetland). They scheduled their build to make sure that nesting birds were undisturbed during the breeding season, and worked together to protect native plant species.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nOur UK water use fell by 12% this year to 1,349,324m 3 , mainly from operating adiabatic cooling units more efficiently within network equipment operating limits, and the pinpointing and fixing of leaks in our water supply.\n\n## Advocacy on climate action\n\nCorporations must advocate on climate action. But limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - in line with the Paris Agreement - will need supportive policies too.\n\nDuring the year we continued participating in initiatives like RE100, the UK Electric Fleets Coalition and EV100, Race to Zero and the We Mean Business Coalition. We also supported the Fossil to Clean campaign to advocate for speeding up the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy.\n\nWithin our business, we reused 10,000 pieces of network equipment. And our catering partner Lexington, working with CauliBox, has been trialling new reusable cups and containers to reduce the number of disposables we use.\n\n## 2030\n\nWe want to become a circular business by 2030 - and build towards a circular tech ecosystem by 2040.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a 5% take back rate for distributed mobile devices - we've set a target to increase this to 20% by 2030.",

And to compare old and new surveys we asked both old and new engagement index questions in the first September survey. Engagement scored pretty consistently between old and new measures - at 72% and 71% respectively.\n\nAcross the year engagement improved by two points. We closed the year on 75% in line with our target. The measure 'Getting things done here is straightforward' is not making enough progress. We're investigating why.\n\nInitiatives to improve our colleagues' experience seem to be making a difference. We've focused on leadership, making things simpler for colleagues and inclusion and diversity.

It's focused on challenging the traditional ways of buying goods and services by simplifying processes, introducing new technology and working more in partnership with suppliers and start-ups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore than 1,000 of our suppliers have signed up to C2FO and in 2023 we facilitated \u00a31.25bn in early payments.\n\nBT Sourced delivered some key initiatives this year:\n\n- - With start-up Nnamu we developed and piloted a 'negotiation bot' based on game theory. It recommends optimum negotiation strategies and tactics, and negotiates autonomously.\n- - Autonomous AI-powered platform Globality is being widely adopted. Its generative AI features are speeding up our scoping processes and streamlining how we define what we need. Plus its new E-Negotiation and online NDA features are simplifying the whole sourcing process.\n- - Specialist macro risk partner PRISM has developed a digitised platform. It shares risk reports, giving us instant access to strategic risk information and a useful archive. It's a valuable resource which is helping us make better, faster procurement decisions.\n- - Our in-house negotiation analytics team continued expanding their AI and machine learning capabilities. To give us a 360-degree view of our suppliers, they combined existing internally developed solutions with summaries of earnings reports, news feeds, projected spend and ESG position.\n- - Responding to inflationary challenges, we strengthened our partnership with C2FO to give suppliers better access to competitive working capital. We also made C2FO's early payment solution more widely available to thousands of our suppliers.\n- - As part of BT Group's ESG supply chain assurance, we worked with Labor Solutions to run a 'worker's voice' survey with five key Asia-based suppliers. Supported by strong identity safeguards, the survey got around 1,500 responses. For more on ESG, see the ESG Addendum (bt.com/esgaddendum).\n\n## The results:\n\n- - Partnering with start-ups like Nnamu will help us scale our digital procurement innovations and benefit stakeholders, buyers and suppliers.\n- - Buyers have so far launched more than 1,000 projects on the Globality platform, with a total spend of roughly \u00a37.9bn. In December 2023, the platform hit a 1.1 working day time-to-market, a big improvement on the typical seven to ten working days with traditional sourcing processes.\n- - Findings from our 'worker's voice' survey gave no major concerns. But they did give us the chance to strengthen relationships with the suppliers we surveyed. We will continue and expand the programme into FY25.\n- - More than 1,000 of our suppliers have signed up to C2FO, including many small and medium-sized businesses. In 2023 we facilitated \u00a31.25bn in early payments.\n- - We're building a more resilient supply chain by adding our new supplier management risk framework (including internal controls) into our wider group key controls framework.\n- - Responding to changing geopolitics, we're improving our crisis management capabilities.

It's supported by commitments on three themes - responsible, inclusive and sustainable.\n\nIt recognises we'll only succeed if we help solve some of the problems faced by the societies and customers we serve. In particular, our commitment to help give people digital skills will benefit wider society.\n\nOur 'BT Group charity approach' explains how we partner with charities and support our people's volunteering work.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee :\n\n- - oversees our Manifesto commitments and progress\n- - reviews our strategy and progress on societal programmes and targets\n- - monitors progress against the goal of reaching 25m UK people with help to improve their digital skills by FY26.\n\n## Results\n\nWe report on how we invest in communities on page 42.\n\nYou can read more on our Manifesto and what we've achieved this year on pages 34 to 39. That includes progress on helping people improve their digital skills.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe consider digital inclusion risks as part of our stakeholder management group risk category on page 63.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\n## Policies\n\nBeing trusted: our code sets out promises including zero-tolerance of bribery and corruption. It's supported by specific standards on Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC), gifts and hospitality, conflicts of interest and high risk third parties.\n\nThe code describes how we expect everyone who works here - or on our behalf - to do business.\n\nIt also covers extra policy areas like human rights, and equality and diversity. And it provides an ethical framework for our ambition to become the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.\n\nThrough our commitment to doing the right thing, it shows how stakeholders can depend on us.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nWe do due diligence on third parties, engage external providers to assess higher risk areas, and use an integrity risk dashboard to identify potential focus areas.\n\nWe take a risk-based approach to thirdparty due diligence. We also have enhanced approval, due diligence and monitoring processes in place for higher risk third parties.\n\nIn 2024, we're launching a new system to better manage gifts and hospitality and conflicts of interest disclosures.\n\n## Results\n\nAll colleagues get mandatory training on our code. We also publish communications that reinforce policies.\n\nTwo of our quarterly colleague engagement surveys include questions on ethical perception, with results shared with senior management.\n\nSpeak Up, our whistleblowing service, lets anyone who works for (or with) us to confidentially report anything that goes against our code. This includes bribery, corruption, human rights violations, bullying or harassment. It had 744 reports this year.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe consider ABC and ethical conduct risks within the legal compliance group risk category - where risks apply across our operations generally.\n\nSee page 66 for more.\n\n## Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 35\n\n## Policies\n\nOur Human Rights Policy explains how we respect and champion human rights in our business - and through our relationships with others. It's supported by our responsible tech principles. Our Manifesto reinforces these principles and our respect for human rights.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nWe have processes to identify and tackle potential and actual human rights impacts across our business. That includes checking we're applying responsible tech principles when we develop, buy, sell and use tech. Our Responsible Tech and Human Rights Sub-Committee oversees how we implement the principles, giving updates to the Responsible Business Committee .\n\nRespecting human rights is part of mandatory annual training for all colleagues.\n\nWe identify, measure and tackle human rights impacts through our Speak Up whistleblowing service, and through risk assessments and on-site audits.\n\n## Results\n\nWe've improved our Business sales due diligence to help us better identify and tackle potential human rights impacts from our products and services.\n\nWe report on our responsible tech principles on page 35.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe consider human rights risks as part of our stakeholder management and supply management Group risk categories on pages 63 and 70.",

We reconcile the financial measures to the closest IFRS measure on pages 230 to 233.\n\n## Financial\n\nYear ended 31 March\n\n## Changes to our KPIs\n\nWe continue to monitor and evolve our KPIs to ensure those reported are the best measures against our strategy. During FY24 we have updated our KPIs to more accurately reflect our strategic priorities.\n\nWe now recognise 'units on legacy' as a KPI, which monitors customer migration from legacy to our strategic network platforms.\n\nWe no longer recognise the cumulative number of people trained on digital skills as a KPI, but we still recognise it as an important metric and track progress - see page 35 for more details.\n\nAdjusted a EBITDA margin has been discontinued as a KPI, although revenue and adjusted a EBITDA remain KPIs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis measures free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after capital expenditure) after adjusting for a number of measures, the largest being net interest paid, payments of lease liabilities, pension deficit payments, specific items and net cash flows related to the sale of contracts assets. For a full definition refer to page 232.\n\n## Performance\n\nWe generated \u00a31,280m of normalised free cash flow (FY23: \u00a31,328m). This was down 4% from last year and reflects working capital timing and a prior year tax refund, offset by EBITDA growth and lower capital expenditure.\n\nLink to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis is our revenue as reported in our income statement.\n\n## Performance\n\nReported revenue was \u00a320,797m (FY23: \u00a320,681m). The increase was driven by price increases and fibreenabled product sales in Openreach, increased service revenue in Consumer with annual contractual price rises being aided by higher roaming and increased FTTP connections, partly offset by legacy product declines and a one-off revenue adjustment in Business.\n\nYou can read more details about CFU performance on pages 56 to 57.\n\n## Reported capital expenditure (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis measures additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the year.

The decrease was the result of lower networks spend despite higher FTTP build in the year due to reduced unit costs and efficiencies.\n\nLink to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nROCE is adjusted earnings before interest and tax as a percentage of equity, debt and debt-like liabilities excluding balances associated with tax and management of financial risk. For a full definition and a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure see page 232.\n\n## Performance\n\nROCE for the year was 8.5% (FY23: 8.3%). This is primarily due to slightly higher adjusted earnings offset by increased capital employed which reflects higher debt to fund our fibre build programme.\n\nLink to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis measures our earnings before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Performance\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was \u00a38,100m (FY23: \u00a37,928m). The increase was primarily due to revenue flow through and cost control more than offsetting cost inflation and one-off items; Openreach and Consumer delivered strong EBITDA growth, partially offset by EBITDA decline in Business due to increased input costs and legacy high-margin managed contract declines.\n\nYou can read more on page 52.\n\n1,2,3\n\nLink to strategy\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE) (%)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also recognised a \u00a3678m tax credit (FY23: \u00a3642m tax credit) in the statement of comprehensive income, mainly relating to the increase in our IAS 19 deficit.\n\nWe expect our sustainable effective tax rate before specific items to be around the UK rate of corporation tax, as we do most of our business in the UK.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nReported earnings per share was 8.7p, down 10.7p, while adjusted b earnings per share was 18.5p, down 3.5p.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure was \u00a34,880m (FY23: \u00a35,056m), down 3% primarily driven by lower network spend despite higher FTTP build in the year, due to reduced unit costs and efficiencies.\n\nCash capital expenditure was down 6% at \u00a34,969m, with the difference to reported capital expenditure primarily representing the timing of government grant funding repayments.\n\n- a Excluding depreciation and amortisation.\n- b Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 230.\n- c Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures, as explained on page 231.\n- d Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 232.\n- e On 1 September 2022 BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery announced completion of their transaction to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV) combining the assets of BT Sport and Eurosport UK. Financial information stated as pro forma is unaudited and is presented to estimate the impact on the group as if trading in relation to BT Sport had been equity accounted for in previous periods, akin to the JV being in place historically. Please refer to Additional Information on page 233 for a bridge between financial information on a reported basis and a Sports JV pro forma basis, which shows a decrease of \u00a3238m to adjusted revenue and increase of \u00a371m to adjusted EBITDA.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a35,953m, down 11%.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d was \u00a31,280m, down 4% primarily due to working capital timing and a prior year tax refund, offsetting EBITDA growth and lower cash capital expenditure. Year-on-year net working capital includes \u00a3(506)m from lower utilisation of a supply chain financing programme offset by \u00a3305m from the sale of cash flows of contract assets relating to mobile handsets and \u00a3105m as a prepayment for the forward sale of copper.\n\nYou can see a reconciliation to normalised free cash flow d from net cash inflow from operating activities (the most directly comparable IFRS measure) on page 232.\n\nThe net cash cost of specific items adjusted from normalised free cash flow d was \u00a3439m (FY23: \u00a3404m), primarily relating to restructuring payments.\n\n## Sports JV performance\n\nOur joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery ('Sports JV'), which has been rebranded to TNT Sports during the year, continues to deliver a compelling sports offering after extending Premier League rights and adding the FA Cup to its comprehensive line-up of premium content. Underlying trading operations in FY24 were profitable but we recognised a share of losses after tax of \u00a341m after adjustments made to align with the group's accounting policies.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment review by reference to the value in use of our cash generating units (CGUs) which represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate independent cash inflows. Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer and Business.\n\nOur FY24 impairment testing exercise concluded that there is significant headroom in our Consumer CGU, consistent with FY23. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to this CGU at 31 March 2024 was \u00a33.9bn (FY23: \u00a33.9bn).\n\nThe carrying value of the Business CGU exceeded its value in use by \u00a3488m. We have therefore booked an impairment charge equivalent to this amount (FY23: \u00a3nil). The charge has been recognised as a specific item.\n\nAfter impairment, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the Business CGU at 31 March 2024 was \u00a33.6bn (FY23: \u00a34.1bn). Of the \u00a34.1bn in FY23, \u00a32.6bn relates to the acquisition of EE in 2016 with the rest relating to historical small acquisitions.\n\nFor more information see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.",

In addition, the IAS 19 liabilities are set by reference to corporate bond yields. The increase in real yields and narrowing of credit spreads over the period have therefore led to an increase in the IAS 19 deficit, partly offset by scheduled contributions of \u00a30.8bn. The impact of these factors is different for the funding valuation deficit.\n\nThe 2023 BTPS funding valuation included a future funding commitment for BT to provide additional deficit contributions should the funding deficit be more than \u00a31bn behind plan at two consecutive semi-annual assessment dates. At the 31 December 2023 assessment date, the funding position was within this limit.\n\nFurther details of the BTPS triennial review can be found in note 19 - Retirement benefit plans on page 185 and in the Section 172 statement on page 93.\n\nThe movements in the deficit for the group's defined benefit plans are shown below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Government is currently consulting on how to serve 'very hard to reach' customers as well as the overall future of Universal Service.\n\nWe recognise Universal Service is a vital safety net for some customers. But we think its scope and detail isn't always proportionate to the number of homes it applies to.\n\nThe continued transformation of UK networks means increased scrutiny from Government and Ofcom on security and resilience. We're continuing to work with all parties to apply the 2018 Telecoms Security Act and remove high-risk vendors from our core network.\n\nOn 25 June 2023 we had a technical fault with the 999 service and there was a short time when calls couldn't get through. We were - and still are - sincerely sorry for the distress this caused and are working closely with the ongoing investigation.\n\nWe're proud of our networks' reliability. We welcome the chance to work with Ofcom as they consider resilience needs for the future. It's important to our customers that we keep providing very reliable services at affordable prices.\n\n## Pricing and competing fairly\n\nIn December 2023 Ofcom closed their enforcement programme into in-contract price variation terms, with no action taken on us. But recent inflation rises have raised concerns over the 'CPI+' pricing models our industry uses. Ofcom feel this can be confusing for customers. We've listened and are introducing a new consumer pricing model, switching from % figures and CPI to a clear and simple 'pounds and pence' view.\n\nWork on implementing one-touch switching continues across the industry. This will make it easier for customers to change providers.\n\nWe always try to look after customers who have difficulty paying for services. We'll continue providing affordable broadband and EE Mobile Basics products to eligible customers - and support vulnerable customers through careful judgements on debt and disconnection. We still have more customers on subsidised or social tariffs than the rest of the industry combined a .\n\nWe're proud of our networks' reliability.

It gave new guidance on traffic management and using network resources efficiently, giving us more flexibility in the products and services we can offer customers.\n\nThere's still more to be done - particularly on better sharing the cost of developing our network to handle significant volumes of content.\n\nAs Vodafone and Three announce details of their proposed merger, we continue to watch developments and feed our views into the process. It's important the UK mobile market is effective and competitive, especially around upcoming spectrum auctions.\n\nWe support the Department for Business and Trade's work on 'Smarter regulation' in the energy, water and telecoms sectors.\n\nIn general we feel that our sector is well regulated - evidenced by big investment and competition over the past few years. But there's always room to improve. We support introducing a 'growth duty' to make sure all regulatory interventions are considered (and reviewed) holistically.\n\nWe provide broadband for 72% of those in the UK who take social tariffs. 72%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## A message from the Chair of Openreach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReflecting on the year, it's clear that Openreach is doing exactly what we set out to do for all our stakeholders. Underpinned by government policy and regulation, we're upgrading the UK's broadband infrastructure at record pace.\n\nCompetitors have made progress. Market growth and inflation have been challenging. Yet Openreach's performance has again been strong.\n\nAs the UK's largest wholesale broadband company, we're continuing to invest in Ultrafast Full Fibre technology. From rural villages to city centres, we've now passed more than13.8 million homes and businesses. We're still heading towards 25 million by the end of 2026 - and we plan to keep going, reaching up to 30m by the end of the decade.\n\nBut we've always said that building the network isn't the end goal. We need customers to connect to it and get the benefits. That's why I'm really pleased to see 4.7m customers already upgraded and enjoying our new platform while we continue to drive down costs and improve the service we give them.\n\n## Delivering for our customers\n\nPeople are spending more time than ever online, and what we deliver is important to them.\n\nWe have a clear focus: delivering great service, building full fibre at pace across the UK and upgrading customers to our best available network.\n\nOpenreach isn't just meeting the high bar Ofcom has set - we're setting our own, even higher, standards.\n\nOur Net Promoter Score (an assessment direct from customers) has improved by 19.5% to 50.2% over the past year, while our Trustpilot score is now 'Excellent' at 4.6.\n\nWith fibre fault rates also lower than copper, there's strong momentum in improving customer experience, but there's always more to do.\n\n## Building efficiently and pricing competitively\n\nWe sped up our build rate again this year, to a peak of one million homes and businesses in the final quarter.\n\nBy harnessing innovation and efficiencies in our supply chain, we've also been driving down the cost of reaching each premises a achieving FTTP build costs per home at the lower end of the \u00a3250 - \u00a3350 range.\n\nTo that end, the value and quality of our product helps us stand out in a competitive market. Our Equinox 2 pricing offer has now been taken up by all our major customers - with the ability to fulfil over 36,000 orders every week. A brilliant start.\n\n## Prioritising our people\n\nOpenreach will always be a people business, and our investment in ensuring our people have the right skills to deliver for our customers continues.\n\nAs more customers move to reliable full fibre services, we'll need fewer engineers to support them because it's a more dependable platform. To that end, we've stopped backfilling certain roles when people leave or retire and we're continuing to flex our reliance on subcontractors. We're also retraining copper engineers with fibre skills and our desk-based teams are exploiting new systems and AI applications.\n\nWe're also becoming more inclusive as we try to better represent the communities we serve.\n\nOur People Networks are growing, continuing to create a safe space for minority colleagues and challenge us on the environment we create for all colleagues.\n\n## Acting sustainably and safely\n\nWe know our operations affect the environment. We've distilled our sustainability objectives into three aims to help us focus.\n\nWe want to lower our carbon footprint, use fewer materials and cut waste, and make a positive impact on nature.\n\nWe're progressing well. We're converting our diesel van fleet to electric vehicles with more than 4,100 already on the road. And last year we recycled around 4,300 tons of copper. But there is still a long way to go.\n\nKeeping colleagues, partners and the public safe is paramount. Almost everyone at\n\nOpenreach has now completed our daylong 'Hearts and Minds' safety programme - a massive investment to refocus our culture on physical and mental wellbeing. We're also keeping up our work to move network assets away from high voltage poles, with the project now completed.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nAs BT Group's deadline for retiring the analogue PSTN approaches, we've become more aware that wholesale customers need support and encouragement to switch to Digital Voice services.\n\nWe welcome new industry commitments on better protecting vulnerable customers and will carry on facilitating upgrades.\n\nAs more people move to full fibre we'll also need fewer exchanges across the UK. Exiting these buildings is challenging and will take many years. But it will help the industry be more cost and energy efficient so we're working closely with CPs to plan and manage this change.\n\n## An environment set for success\n\nFinally, it's worth reflecting on the success of the sector.\n\nA combination of UK Government tax policy and Ofcom's Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review (WFTMR) have driven investment and fierce competition across our industry.\n\nAn alt-net community - with access to our ducts and poles - has added to an already strong retail market. This is leading to better outcomes and giving customers an even wider choice of offers, products and services.\n\nThe framework is working. But the business case for full fibre investments still stretches to nearly 20 years, so what everyone needs is a continued period of regulatory and Government policy stability.\n\nMeanwhile, technology change keeps getting faster and there'll be increasing challenges to reach more rural, isolated communities. Our focus will be on upgrading as many customers as possible. And - with our unrivalled track record in rural connectivity - we're looking forward to playing our part in the Government's Project Gigabit programme.\n\nWe're doing well, and that wouldn't be possible without our people. So I want to thank all of our colleagues who've worked tirelessly to maintain that momentum this year.\n\n## Mike McTighe\n\nChair, Openreach 15 May 2024",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nRisk management taken seriously, and done simply and consistently, helps us make the best decisions for our colleagues, customers, shareholders and wider stakeholders in the face of uncertainty. It is fundamental to our strategy and performance.\n\n## Our risk management framework\n\nRisk management is integral to our business and to achieving our strategic priorities. Our risk management framework makes sure that we manage risks in a smart and structured way. It helps us reach our goals, deliver our strategy, support our business model and protect our assets while leading the way to a bright, sustainable future.\n\nWe align risk management activities with our strategic framework, business planning and performance management. This helps integrate risk thinking into key decisionmaking areas. It also makes sure we share information in a joined-up way for the biggest impact.\n\n## How we manage risks\n\nWe divide our risk landscape into 16 Group Risk Categories (GRCs) of enduring risks like People and Cyber Security - that will not change significantly over time and can be managed consistently across the organisation.\n\nFor each GRC we set our risk appetite. That is how much risk we're willing to take, underpinned by metrics with upper and lower limits which set our tolerance. We manage enduring risks within each GRC through clear policies complemented by standards and a group-wide Key Control Framework.\n\nWe use a 'three lines of defence' model to define clear roles and responsibilities, coordinate assurance activities and give confidence to stakeholders that we're managing risks effectively.\n\nWe're also aware of - and act on - current, specific risks and uncertainties which are important at a point in time and dynamic in nature. We categorise these as:\n\n- 1. Point risks: Risks we can't manage effectively through the key control framework, or that are materially significant to us and need to be managed separately.\n- 2. Emerging risks: Uncertainties which might be materially significant but whose causes and impacts we can't presently fully define.\n\nWe align these types of risks to a GRC based on their causes and consequences.\n\nFor point risks, we assess their potential impacts and likelihood, assign management ownership and decide how to best manage the risks. We keep monitoring risks and action plans - making changes like agreeing new actions as needed.\n\nWe also assess emerging risks but with different criteria. We look at potential impacts, level of preparedness and the time horizon. Reflecting that emerging risks are uncertain, we also consider those that may occur in the longer term (more than three years).\n\nSome emerging risks are more ambiguous and broader than others, needing coordinated, cross-group assessment and action. We use our emerging risk hubs when considering these risks. They bring together cross-functional representatives to share intelligence, identify potential trade-offs and agree actions.\n\n## Our risk governance and culture\n\nUltimately, the Board has overall responsibility for risk management. On the Board's behalf, the Audit and Risk Committee provides oversight of and monitors the effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls systems.\n\nTwice a year, the Board gets a summary of how we're managing key risks across all GRCs. The Audit and Risk Committee also holds discussions with Executive Committee members to conduct deep dives into specific GRCs across the year.\n\nEach GRC has an Executive Committee sponsor. They set our risk appetite, how we measure our exposure to that risk, and how we manage it within our target tolerance. This provides accountability, 'tone from the top' and joined-up risk thinking.\n\nEach unit leadership team regularly reviews, discusses, prioritises and acts on risks, aligned to GRCs. This drives conversations about risk management across every part of the organisation leading to risk-informed decisions and better business outcomes.\n\nWe have oversight bodies in place at both unit and group level - where key risk information gets reported regularly.\n\nOur leaders promote a mindset of being smart with risk when making decisions. Our code sets expected behaviours for all our colleagues. Ongoing training and formally defined risk management roles also help weave risk awareness into our culture.\n\nOur risk management tool, ARTEMIS, helps us consistently apply our risk, control and assurance frameworks across BT Group. It links risks with the relevant controls and assurance outcomes. It also simplifies and standardises reporting. This helps us to make sure we're managing risks in a joined-up and consistent way.\n\nOur leaders promote a mindset of being smart with risk when making decisions.

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Enhancing our risk management framework\n\nWe keep strengthening how we apply our risk management framework, in step with our changing business and risk landscape.\n\nThis year we launched two new training modules covering the basics of our framework and the behaviours we expect from our leaders. We rolled them out across our senior leadership team and everyone involved in making our framework a success. The training helped everyone understand the expectations and benefits risk management brings to BT Group.\n\nWe continue to develop our key control framework, and this year was about embedding it consistently across the units with our leaders taking active ownership for the controls in their area, making it core to operations, decision making and mindset.\n\nWe focused on two things:\n\n- 1. Identifying and prioritising areas that needed strengthening.\n- 2. Reviewing our overall approach to how we assess control effectiveness, including second line assurance activities across the GRCs to make sure they are sufficient and proportionate to the risks and their impact.\n\n## An ever-changing risk landscape\n\nWe operate in a challenging external environment. Economic uncertainty, adverse market conditions, growing geopolitical tensions and more regulatory scrutiny are all impacting our risk exposure - meaning more focus and management.\n\nBelow, we discuss some of the key changes to our risk landscape during the past 12 months.\n\n## Data and AI\n\nAI and data use are growing fast and changing the way businesses operate. The regulatory landscape, technological advancements and public awareness are quickly evolving in step - with hard to predict outcomes. Generative AI has the potential to change the way we serve our customers and how our workplace looks.\n\nWhilst there is a lot of opportunity, it also means we need to carefully manage risks relating to procuring, developing, using and selling AI solutions.\n\nManaging AI risks cuts across many of our GRCs. For example, we need to ensure we invest in the right AI skills and capabilities. We must also apply responsible technology principles that maintain our stakeholders' trust.\n\nThe growing use of AI also means relying even more on data, which creates new challenges and risks. Given the synergies between the two, we've expanded our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAI\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to change the way we serve our customers and how our workplace looks.\n\nData GRC to include both data and AI. This will let us use our risk management framework to make sure we have the right risk appetite, standards and key controls for increasingly material AI risks.\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThe market is filled with challenges around the macroeconomic environment, competitor movements, regulatory pressures and technological advances.\n\nWe're managing risks related to increasing competition in the broadband and mobile markets, while also navigating retail pricing pressures and making sure we treat all our customers fairly.\n\nWe're also closely monitoring and acting on the risks of disintermediation by hyperscalers as they introduce alternative technology solutions.\n\n## The geopolitical risk landscape\n\nGeopolitical tensions and wars across the world - like in the South China Sea or Ukraine - create risks to businesses like ours. This year the conflict in the Middle East region has amplified a wide range of potential impacts, including disruption to suppliers, higher energy costs and increased cyber security threats.\n\nGeopolitical risks can change fast and affect various parts of our organisation. We use our emerging risk hub to bring together the right people to make action plans as these risks evolve.",

Each GRC contains enduring risks, as well as examples of the current point and emerging risks. We also include the scenarios we've used for our viability analyses for each GRC.\n\n## Strategic\n\n## Strategy, technology and competition\n\nSponsor: Chief Financial Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nTo deliver value to our stakeholders and achieve our strategic objectives, we must carefully manage risks around economic uncertainty, intensifying competition and rapidly changing customer and technology trends. If we adopt the wrong strategy, fail to incorporate our strategy into our business plans or don't effectively implement it, we could become less competitive and hinder the creation of long-term sustainable value.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite sets our tolerance for managing 'internal' risks associated with this category. We measure and track this through specific metrics. We also qualitatively assess the clarity of our strategy, robustness of our strategic analysis and whether our business and financial plans align with our strategy. Doing this helps us make robust strategic choices and effectively implement them - to stay competitive and grow value for our stakeholders.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Macroeconomic environment factors like high inflation, high interest rates and reduced customer confidence may lower demand, increase customers' price sensitivity and drive up costs.\n- - Intensifying competition in retail and wholesale markets could increase churn and affect our market share.\n- - Disintermediation by hyperscalers could result in loss of market share and weakened customer relationships.\n- - Slower than planned progress on key programmes could limit our ability to deliver our strategy and growth ambitions.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - Failing to harness AI technologies to drive efficiencies and generate value could make us less competitive.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We research, analyse and monitor economic, customer, competitor and technology trends to inform our strategy.\n- - The Executive Committee and Board regularly review performance against our strategic priorities and targets.\n- - The Executive Committee and Board discuss key strategic topics throughout the year.\n- - BT Investment Sub-Committee considers our investments to make sure they are aligned to our strategy.\n\n## Scenarios considered in viability analysis\n\nHyperscalers strategically entering our markets through direct initiatives.\n\nCompetitive pressures from alternative FTTP network providers continue to intensify.\n\n## Stakeholder management\n\n## Sponsor: Corporate Affairs Director\n\n## What this category covers\n\nStakeholder management, built on trust, is essential to us achieving our ambitions. We engage with stakeholders fairly and transparently to maintain strong, sustainable relationships and manage reputational risks. We also consider risks around using and selling emerging technologies, environment, social and governance factors, and customer fairness.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe recognise the importance of strong stakeholder relationships and consider them when setting strategy and making decisions. We aim to balance our purpose and ambition with commercial choices we think are reasonable. At times this creates tensions when weighing up options: price rises to sustain investment, the markets we operate in, who we buy from and sell to, the way we use and develop technology and how we use data.\n\nWe want to keep being sector leader on reputation and trust among professional opinion formers, and stay in our top quartile position on ESG.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Protecting our customers' interests while migrating to digital products and closing legacy networks.\n- - Continued geopolitical tensions needing extra focus on reputational risks associated with our global operations.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- - Rapid advances in AI with associated stakeholder scrutiny on things like data ethics and reskilling.\n- - Climate change, and perceptions of our sector's role in carbon emissions. See our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (pages 71 to 80).\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - Our Manifesto (pages 34 to 39) sets out our commitment to growth through responsible, inclusive and sustainable technology. The Responsible Business Committee provides Board-level governance.\n- - We monitor the media, and track our reputation across our main stakeholder groups.\n- - We engage with stakeholders to build strong relationships.

That means looking at the nature of the risk, the cost of compliance, the value of the proposed actions and the steps we'd need to take to bring them within our risk appetite.\n\nIn corporate governance, we determine the risks for a position we take based on things like our rules and policies, market practice, investor expectations and our stakeholders' views.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Sales practices that - because of living costs or tricky market conditions - could potentially be seen as inappropriate.\n- - Failing to effectively manage third-parties, leading to fines or reputational damage.\n- - Evolving regulatory and litigation environment may lead to financial and reputational impact.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- - Increased regulatory burden around corporate governance and reporting.\n- - New laws, changes to existing ones, or trade sanctions responding to geopolitical dynamics or concerns in a particular area of law.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - Through our Code we foster a culture where colleagues know the standards we expect and speak up if something's not right.\n- - We regularly assess risks when we give legal or compliance advice on strategic projects, new business or commercial operations.\n- - We train colleagues to know where legal and compliance risks come from, how to handle them and when to get expert help.\n- - We carry out assurance on day-to-day operations, regions, partners, projects and suppliers. We investigate and fix anomalies and share what we learn, where needed.\n\n## Scenarios considered in viability analysis\n\nA breach of sanctions or export controls - leading to regulatory investigation, fines, debarring from public contracts and reputational damage.\n\nWe fail to successfully defend the high value claims brought against the group.\n\n## Financial services\n\n## Sponsor: CEO, Consumer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe're exposed to more financial services regulation as we attract new consumer credit and insurance customers. We expect to continue scaling-up and broadening these products and services in the coming years. That means meeting all applicable Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) principles, rules and requirements.\n\nOperating outside FCA rules, requirements or permissions could harm customers and lead to fines, loss of FCA permissions, slow service take-up and broader reputational damage.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe aim to minimise regulatory risk in two ways. First, by building operational capabilities that help us develop our financial services activities compliantly. Second, by maintaining a trusted relationship with the FCA.\n\nWe monitor a range of conduct risk metrics. We focus on meeting Consumer Duty outcomes including compliance monitoring, complaints data and customers in collections. These are early warning indicators of potential customer harm which we can act on.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Failing to get extra FCA permissions in time to support a planned entry into a new market.\n- - Failing to meet the additional requirements of Insurance Regulatory Framework could result in revenue loss and regulatory fines.\n- - Challenges complying with the Payment Services Directive regulation because of potential delays in us addressing Electronic Communications Exclusion cap breaches.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - There might be a mismatch between our business strategy and additional FCA regulatory permissions.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We scan the horizon, interpret new regulations and regularly communicate with the regulator.\n- - We run mandatory training on FCA regulations, aligned to job roles.\n- - We check our financial services products and promotions are compliant before we launch them, and every year afterward.\n- - We have processes in place to make sure customers get the right outcomes.\n- - Our governance framework provides clear responsibility, accountability and reporting.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nFailing to get additional FCA permissions may result in adverse impact on product rollout and projected revenues.",

That means being operationally resilient and managing any risk that could disrupt our services.\n\nService disruptions could be caused by things like bad weather, accidental or deliberate damage to our assets.\n\nSome service disruptions might depend on suppliers' and partners' reliability - making it important to pick the right ones.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe want customers to get market-leading services, underpinned by best-in-class network performance. To achieve that we must prioritise resources to give the best possible service and customer experience, while aligning with our strategy.\n\nWe aim to deliver exceptional performance for Critical National Infrastructure, high volume (FTTC/4G) and strategic (FTTP/5G) products whilst maintaining acceptable performance for legacy services.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Power cuts, caused by energy shortages, might lead to service disruptions.\n- - Increasing flood risk at non-protected sites could disrupt services.\n- - Weak contracts or badly managed third-party relationships might lead to gaps in support arrangements and extended fix times.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - More frequent extreme weather events due to climate change could impact our business operations.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We have standardised processes to keep our assets resilient across the asset lifecycle.\n- - We respond quickly to incidents. We reduce their impact through geographically dispersed emergency response teams and give customers regular updates.\n- - We have comprehensive testing and change management processes.\n- - We do regular business impact assessments that feed into tested, up-to-date business continuity and restoration plans.\n- - We make sure our operational estate has the right levels of physical security controls in place to keep our services running.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nCrisis in the energy sector leading to winter power shortages.\n\n## Cyber security\n\n## Sponsor: Chief Security and Networks Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nOur aim is to protect BT Group, colleagues and customers from harm and financial loss from cyber security events.\n\nWe run critical national infrastructure. So a cyber attack - from an external or internal threat or a third party - could disrupt both customers and the country, and compromise data.\n\nA poorly managed cyber security event might cost us money, damage our reputation and impact our market share. The regulator might also impose fines or penalties.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nCyber risk is inherent to our business, and we could suffer significant reputational damage from a major cyber event. But we acknowledge that we can't eradicate all cyber risks.\n\nCyber security events could be deliberate or accidental, coming from inside or outside the group. So we adapt our security position and controls accordingly to detect and respond to evolving threats.\n\nWe prioritise protecting our critical systems and networks, and the data and information they contain.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - State-sponsored cyber attacks could target critical national infrastructure and lead to service disruption, data loss, regulatory action and reputational damage.\n- - Being exposed to suppliers with security vulnerabilities might lead to data loss, interrupted services or reputational damage.\n- - Faster organisational change could create conditions where people didn't follow our policies, leading to a cyber security incident.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- - AI and machine learning create opportunities, but they could also be weaponised as security threats.\n- - Quantum technologies could present a threat to how we protect sensitive digital information.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We have security standards, tools and processes in place to protect our applications, systems and networks.\n- - We monitor external threats and gather intelligence on evolving cyber techniques, tactics and capabilities.\n- - So we can quickly detect, assess and respond to cyber risks we keep a vigilant security stance.\n- - We run communications, engagement and training for our colleagues.\n- - We continue to invest in our cyber defences and security tools, shifting to automation where appropriate.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nWe fall victim to a widely publicised cyber attack. It leads to loss of customer data, compensation claims and enduring reputational damage.",

We'll seek to avoid risks that could compromise key business priorities, and minimise any that can't be avoided to as low as reasonably practicable. We avoid risks that could lead us to not complying with applicable employment legislation.\n\nA relatively small number of roles have a disproportionate effect on our success. For those, we have a much lower risk tolerance of not having the right capabilities.\n\nTo deliver our transformation and achieve our ambitions, we're prepared to take carefully managed short-term employee relations risks.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Changes to our strategy, technology or business model could affect what skills we need. Combined with tightened talent markets and potentially higher attrition, that could create skills gaps.\n- - Failing to drive an inclusive culture might affect our ability to achieve our targets, and subsequently affect business results.\n- - Failing to make the organisational and cultural changes we need to drive long-term success.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - Changes in working patterns, or increased financial uncertainty, could have a negative effect on colleagues' mental health.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We have consistent performance management review processes and goals - shared through clear organisational structures, roles and job descriptions.\n- - We continually assess skills and capabilities and invest in groupwide workforce and talent planning.\n- - We provide training and development opportunities for specific roles, as well as for the future skills we need.\n- - Our Inclusion, Equity and Diversity strategy raises awareness, addresses bias and promotes our People Networks and support (more on pages 24 and 30 to 33).\n- - We monitor and try to improve employee engagement and maintain close relationships with formal representative groups and unions.\n- - We offer fair, competitive and sustainable remuneration to promote smart risk taking, boost engagement and retention and align colleagues' and shareholders' interests.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nA widespread lack of availability of frontline colleagues affecting service delivery and leading to poor customer experience and reputational harm.\n\n## Health, safety and environment\n\n## Sponsor: Chief Security and Networks Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe have diverse working environments in various locations, some of which pose a health or safety risk. We're committed to ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues, contractors, suppliers, customers, visitors and members of the public.\n\nWe are committed to protecting the environment and building a sustainable future, with effective environment and energy management - and particular focus on reducing our carbon emissions.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment (HSE) is a key priority for the business and is the foundation on which we operate. Our strategy is to maintain effective HSE risk management to make sure our employees (and others who are affected by our undertaking) and the environment are properly protected.\n\nWe apply proactive risk management to identify, control and mitigate significant risks across the business to a level deemed as low as reasonably practicable.\n\nWe consider legal, regulatory and other requirements as the minimum obligation. We want to go beyond that - aiming for zero avoidable harm and the prevention of pollution.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Heightened risks from the additional civil and construction work to support the full fibre rollout including harm to colleagues, increased regulatory scrutiny, legal claims and reputational damage.\n- - Failing to ensure effective in-life contractor management, which may result in increased risks through sub-optimal working practices, and subsequent enforcement action, legal claims and reputational damage.\n- - Failing to effectively manage waste could lead to material financial loss and reputational damage.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - Our group policy is underpinned by our standards and key controls and the HSE framework is reflected in our code.\n- - We train colleagues and make sure they're clear on their responsibilities and are competent to undertake their activities.\n- - We make sure that colleagues and their representatives participate in (and are consulted on) HSE matters.\n- - We adopt a leadership role with our contractors, helping them improve their own HSE performance.\n- - We allocate appropriate resources to develop, maintain and continually improve our HSE management system.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nA new pandemic as severe as Covid-19 causes harm to colleagues and disrupts service delivery and business operations.",

We do that while navigating customer relationships and risk in complex agreements - delivering highly sensitive, critical or essential services globally.\n\nCustomer contractual terms can be onerous and challenging to meet, which can lead to delays, penalties and disputes. Delivery or service failures against obligations and commitments could damage our brand and reputation, particularly for critical infrastructure contracts or security and data protection services.\n\nNot managing contract exits, migrations, renewals or disputes could erode profit margins and affect future customer relationships.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe want a diverse mix of major contracts to help our business grow. To do that, we must build our market share, target the right customers, make beneficial commercial and legal agreements and deliver services successfully.\n\nAs markets change, we need to proactively adjust our portfolio of services, countries and customers to avoid concentration risk, stagnation and legacy dependency.\n\nWe know this involves taking on higher risk - for example, complex customer agreements with obligations not fully covered by our standard portfolio, terms and conditions and/or delivery processes. We must manage this risk in the bid process and contract lifecycle to minimise the overall impact.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Failing to deliver on bespoke customer data requirements could lead to potential breaches, fines and reputational harm.\n- - New IT infrastructure challenges, skills shortages, scale or complexity could stop us delivering our digital portfolio transformation.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- - The changing competitor landscape might affect market dynamics and competition.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We have a clear governance framework to assess new business opportunities, manage bids and monitor in-life contract risks.\n- - As part of bids, we check non-standard unfavourable terms and conditions and mitigate them where we can.\n- - Our senior management, and a dedicated team, regularly review our contracts.\n- - We support frontline contract managers with contract and obligation management tools.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nA major incident causes reputational damage, leading to us losing major public services contracts.\n\n- a Excluding Openreach, which has separate GRC sponsorship and management.\n\n## Customers, brand and product\n\n## Sponsor: CEO, Consumer a\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe want to give customers standout service, build personal and enduring relationships, and take extra care of vulnerable customers and customers with differing needs. We aim to keep customer satisfaction high as we continue to migrate customers from legacy products and services to new ones.\n\nIf we didn't continually improve and personalise our customer experience, it could affect customer satisfaction and retention, our colleagues' pride and advocacy, revenues and brand value.\n\nAccurate and competitive pricing is important. We must also manage product and service lifecycles, inventory and supply chain, and meet our customer obligations and product and service standards.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe want to be below the industry average for Ofcom complaints and keep improving our customer NPS. We aim to maintain customer satisfaction, launch new products and services that benefit them and minimise issues.\n\nWe must serve customers through modern, cost-effective platforms and minimise the number of them on expensive, old and labour-intensive legacy products and services. We also want customers to feel we give them personalised service through frictionless channels.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Failing to switch customers (including those who are vulnerable or have differing needs) from old to new service platforms could interrupt their service, cause customer churn and/or lead to regulatory intervention.\n- - Failing to make sure we have the right current and future skills to serve our customers could lead us to not meet customer expectations, lose customers or market share and harm our reputation.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - Customer trust and confidence in future AI solutions.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We keep our promises on the service levels customers should expect and we track a range of customer experience performance metrics while continuing to improve service.\n- - We have processes in place to identify and serve vulnerable and differing needs customers.\n- - We have clear and comprehensive brand guidelines.\n- - We work with suppliers to manage relationships and risks.\n- - We design new products and services (and pilot them where possible) to make sure they benefit customers.\n- - We have a colleague retention and skills development plan to make sure we're not short on key skills.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nA defect in a customer's device - leading to a full product recall and a significant service disruption.",

        "page_content": "## Our principal risks and uncertainties continued\n\n## Operational\n\n## Supply management\n\n## Sponsor: Chief Financial Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe have a lot of suppliers. Successfully selecting, bringing on board and managing them is essential for us to deliver quality products and services.\n\nWe must make decisions about suppliers on concentration, capability, resilience, security, costs and broader issues that could impact our business and reputation.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nOur appetite guides buying decisions. That includes sole or dual sourcing for products or services that support key business aims or activities - or where alternative sources aren't economically viable. To get the best commercial rates and operational resilience we continuously engage with and challenge key suppliers on pricing, without introducing service and/or delivery risks.\n\nProperly managing so many third parties needs effective governance. So we have a low appetite for dealing with suppliers outside of our defined policies or processes.\n\nWe have to make sure third parties don't expose our brands to damage. That means avoiding - or stopping working with - any that don't meet our standards on key areas like human rights.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- - Increased energy prices, supply shortages and inflation could affect cost-cutting targets and future investments.\n- - Geopolitical tensions (like the Russia-Ukraine war and escalations in the Middle East) could disrupt supply chain, raise costs and inflation, and increase cyber security threats.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- - A difficult economic environment could put pressure on smaller suppliers.\n- - Extreme climate conditions might disrupt supply chains.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - Our sourcing strategy uses different approaches to managing risk by category. That includes standard terms and conditions and controls so we can make purchasing decisions efficiently and effectively.\n- - We have comprehensive supplier due diligence, contract management, on-boarding processes and are reviewing and improving our in-life assessment process.\n- - We have robust supplier risk management, performance, renewal and termination processes.\n- - We do demand planning and forecasting, stock counts and inventory management so we have supplies available.\n- - We get assurance that the goods and services we buy are made, delivered and disposed of responsibly. That includes monitoring energy use, labour standards and environmental, social and governance impacts.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tensions lead to supply chain disruptions and cost inflation.\n\n## Transformation delivery\n\n## Sponsor: Chief Financial Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe're accelerating transformation delivery to build a simpler, more efficient and dynamic BT Group.\n\nWe're modernising our IT, automating processes with AI, streamlining our product portfolio and migrating to nextgeneration strategic networks. All this will deliver significant cost efficiencies - while also improving our customers' and colleagues' digital experiences.\n\nFailing to manage transformation execution risks could make us less efficient and damage our financial performance and customer experience.\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe've defined the risk level we're willing to tolerate for transforming our products, customer journeys and technology. We track specific metrics to check we're achieving genuine, sustainable transformation outcomes and not just cutting costs.\n\nDelivering within our risk appetite will give us competitive advantage, enable faster delivery, improve customer experience and make sure our costs benchmark favourably with peers.\n\n## Examples of dynamic risks Point risks:\n\n- - Failure to manage complex interdependencies to complete the migration of customers and close legacy IT and networks.\n- - The volume and complexity of our transformational activities across different parts of the group, combined with day-to-day business, could dilute our efforts and stop us reaching our sustainable transformation goals.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- - Delays in switching customers onto new, strategic products could slow or stop us closing our copper network and exchanges.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage these risks\n\n- - We review transformation performance at monthly Executive Committee meetings - managing dependencies, making informed decisions and removing blockers.\n- - We have strong governance, with senior leaders owning specific operational and financial outcomes. Each quarter we assess our performance - allocating funding to the programmes delivering the most strategic value.\n- - We invest in digital and data capabilities to cut costs, grow revenue and make sure we have the right resources to deliver sustainable change effectively.\n- - We invest in our people strategy to make sure we have the right skills and culture needed to deliver transformation.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis\n\nWe are not able to execute the transformation plans we need to deliver savings initiatives.",

Matters reserved to the Board include items of big strategic importance - things that directly impact the group's funding position, reputation, integrity or ethical standards.\n\n## Responsible Business Committee\n\nThis Committee oversees our climate change strategy, programme and goals. It meets at least three times a year to monitor progress on our longterm responsible business goals including climate change. It also assesses the sustainability underpin relative to our Restricted Share Plan, and makes recommendations to the Remuneration Committee . The Chair reports to the Board after each meeting. There's more about the Responsible Business Committee on page 105.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nThis Committee monitors and assesses our risk management and internal control systems' effectiveness on the Board's behalf. That includes climate change risks which span a number of different group risk categories (GRCs). You can read more about this Committee on pages 99 to 103 and more about our GRCs on pages 63 to 70.\n\n## Management's roles and responsibilities\n\n## Chief Executive\n\nThe Chief Executive is responsible for our environmental policy and performance. That includes climate-related issues. The Chief Executive approves our targets - including those on net zero, circular economy and customer carbon avoidance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Health, Safety & Environment SubCommittee\n\nOur Group Health, Safety & Environment (GHSE) SubCommittee meets quarterly and manages a range of risk and compliance issues - including climate change - on the Executive Committee's behalf and reports back regularly. It's chaired by our Chief Security and Networks Officer - an Executive Committee member - and made up of senior leaders from across the business. The GHSE Sub-Committee reports Health, Safety, and Environmental performance to the Board monthly, including our energy consumption.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee sets our operational strategy on climate change and sustainability. It also monitors associated progress, performance and risks - supported by our responsible business team.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThis Committee agrees the remuneration framework for the Chairman, Executive Directors, and members of the Executive Committee . It also monitors remuneration practices and policies for the wider workforce. In FY24 we updated our sustainability-linked remuneration. We have a sustainability underpin relative to our Restricted Share Plan for Executive Directors, which you can read more about on page 106.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our timeframes consider our risk management framework, financial planning processes, external legal and regulatory changes and the longer-term nature of physical climate changes.\n\n## Short-term (0-3 years)\n\nThis timeframe considers the chance of events exposing us to risk over the next three years, in line with our risk management framework. We factor in acute physical risks like flooding and higher temperatures into our annual plans. This helps us to adapt and reduce the impact on our business or value chain.\n\n## Medium-term (3-5 years)\n\nThis timeframe aligns to our financial planning process, which uses a five-year horizon.\n\n## Long-term (5-20+ years)\n\nThis timeframe matches our investment timeframes for strategic assets like networks that we plan over longer periods - sometimes up to 20 years. It also influences our strategy, targets and plans for responding to climate change's bigger risks and transitional implications. Our scenario analysis considers risks in 2050 and beyond, and our long-term climate targets extend to FY41.\n\n## Transition scenarios\n\n## Physical scenarios\n\nTable 2: BT Group's Climate Scenarios\n\n| Name                     |   Temperature equivalent  scenarios (\u00b0C warming by  2100 above preindustrial  levels) | Description                                                                                                                                         | Name     |   Temperature equivalent  scenarios (\u00b0C warming by  2100 above preindustrial  levels) | Description                                                                     |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Current Policies  (CP)   |                                                                                   3   | High emissions Emissions keep  rising as no extra  climate policies are  implemented from  today.                                                   | SSP5-8.5 |                                                                                   4.4 | High emissions Emissions keep rising  at current rates with  no policy changes. |\n| Delayed Transition  (DT) |                                                                                   1.6 | Low emissions Emissions keep  rising until 2030.

Carbon prices are derived from equivalent scenarios from the IEA, to represent an explicit carbon tax.\n\n## Analysing our strategy using climate scenarios\n\nWe use scenario analysis to understand what risks and opportunities could affect us in the long term. This year we focused on advancing our financial impact modelling, and establishing metrics to monitor our progress in managing these risks and opportunities.\n\n## Our scenario analysis process\n\nWe try to identify and assess the risks and opportunities likely to have the most material financial impact on our business - like on revenues, current and future potential costs, including capital.\n\nWe use different scenarios to assess our climate risks and opportunities from physical impacts and the move to a low-carbon economy. We've based our scenarios on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a , Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and International Energy Agency (IEA), among other sources b .\n\nThe table below shows the different climate-related scenarios we've considered to help test our organisational strategy's resilience.

        "page_content": "In line with TCFD guidance and requirements a , we modelled the impact on our current strategy and business plan - using current decarbonisation plans and the commitments in our medium term plan.\n\nFor some transition risks and opportunities, we present the financial impacts of different action we could take - to show worst and best case scenarios.\n\nFor physical risks, we present the financial impacts for our UK and global sites, considering our most critical network building assets such as our telephone exchanges and data centres. This does not include mobile phone masts, telephone cabinets, or cable infrastructure.\n\nThis year, we assessed physical risks in our supply chain, looking at 28 critical suppliers. We assessed this with country-level climate data considering our suppliers' main country of operation. We assessed the impact of more flooding, more intense, longer and more frequent heatwaves and extreme weather events. As we collect more accurate locations of our suppliers and logistics network, we plan to refine this analysis and expand to other climate hazards such as drought.\n\nWe've presented the final outputs in annualised nominal terms. We haven't applied social discount factors to avoid double counting with our financial models. We categorised the financial effects using our risk management framework, and treated each risk and opportunity as mutually exclusive events.\n\n## The results of our analysis\n\nWe think our strategy is resilient to climate risks and is well positioned to capture climate opportunities in the modelled scenarios. The tables below summarises our prioritised climate risks and opportunities for the different scenarios we considered.\n\nWe've concluded that climate risks and opportunities don't have a material effect on our FY24 financial statements disclosures. As we anticipate that the magnitude of climate risks and opportunities will change over time, we'll closely monitor our risks and opportunities and expand the assessment as part of continually assessing climate risks.\n\nIn high emissions scenarios (CP and SSP5-8.5), physical risks have a greater impact than transition risks, as these are driven by more frequent and severe weather, particularly in the longer term. Our analysis looks at direct climate change impacts on the most material areas of our business. It doesn't include secondary effects - like forced migration or geopolitical tensions resulting from climate change.\n\nWe recognise the very severe consequences this scenario could have globally. We're working to play our part in decarbonising our own operations and value chain to help avoid it.\n\nAt the same time, we're making sure we prepare for increasingly severe and frequent climate-related hazards. We're investing in flood defences, cooling upgrades and better analytics data to make sure that our network is resilient.\n\nConversely, we expect transition risks to have a greater impact under low emissions scenarios (DT and NZ). That's because they're driven by changes in policy and regulation as well as stakeholders' behaviour (including customers).\n\nThere are also opportunities linked to the low-carbon transition like developing carbon abatement solutions to help customers cut emissions, and cutting energy costs through efficiency measures. DT scenario trends are similar to NZ - but with the impact on the business happening sooner under NZ.\n\nWe're acting to reduce risk across the various climate-related scenarios, with an emphasis on long-term resilience.\n\nRelative impact\n\nTable 3: Summary of our physical risks from climate change\n\n| Prioritised risk or  opportunity                                  | Time  horizon b   | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Potential financial impacts                                                                                                                           |          | 2030   | 2040   | 2050   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| More flooding c                                                   | Long              | More frequent and severe  flooding, increasing  damage to BT Group  infrastructure.                                                                                     | - Higher costs to repair damaged assets. - Lower revenue from network disruption.                                                                     | SSP5-8.5 |        |        |        |\n|                                                                   | Long              | More frequent and severe  flooding, increasing  damage to BT Group  infrastructure.                                                                                     | - Higher costs to repair damaged assets. - Lower revenue from network disruption.                                                                     | SSP2-4.5 |        |        |        |\n|                                                                   |                   |                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                       | SSP1-2.6 |        |        |        |\n| More intense,  longer and more  frequent  heatwaves More intense, | Long              | Higher temperatures and  more frequent heatwaves,  affecting BT Group  operations and leading to                                                                        | - Higher energy costs from extra cooling  demands for equipment and operations  during high temperature periods.                                      | SSP5-8.5 |        |        |        |\n| More intense,  longer and more  frequent  heatwaves More intense, | Long              | Higher temperatures and  more frequent heatwaves,  affecting BT Group  operations and leading to                                                                        | - Lower productivity from labour hours lost                                                                                                           | SSP2-4.5 |        |        |        |\n| More intense,  longer and more  frequent  heatwaves More intense, | Long              | increased energy                                                                                                                                                        | through heat stress.                                                                                                                                  | SSP1-2.6 |        |        |        |\n| longer and more  frequent  extreme weather  events                | Long              | Storms and extreme wind  damaging assets that then  our service, increasing  maintenance costs and  reducing revenue.

        "page_content": "## Embedding climate change into our strategy\n\n## Responding to our main physical risks\n\nOur exposure to physical risks changes over time. Rolling out full fibre and closing our legacy networks will mean fewer physical network sites. That will cut our exposure to physical climate change risks (but does mean more services going through fewer operational locations).\n\nOn top of that, full fibre is more 'passive' (with no electronics between exchanges and connected properties) - further mitigating the risk of flooding, or extreme heat or weather damaging our equipment.\n\nOur insurance policies cover claims on asset loss and damage which also lessens any potential financial impact of climate and weather events.\n\n## More flooding\n\nIn line with our future location strategy, last year we completed an analysis of possible flood risks from climate change across different climate change scenarios.\n\nThis year we used that analysis to decide where to invest in measures to help us minimise - or respond faster to flooding. These include installing and upgrading sump pumps and bulkheads at our sites. We also updated the site analysis with the latest data to keep it accurate and up-to-date.\n\nWe're expanding our climate change flood risk assessments to help us make decisions on future strategic locations. This year we trialled using drones to survey potential risks around water getting into the fabric of our buildings.\n\n## More intense, longer and more frequent heatwaves\n\nIn most scenarios from 2030-2050 the UK will see more extreme heat days. We have been undertaking a programme of cooling upgrades at our core network and mobile sites, which allow them to operate effectively in up to 45\u00b0C external temperatures.\n\nThis year we've invested nearly \u00a33m in these upgrades at our larger core metronode sites. We've also finished upgrades in our strategic data centres and upgraded cooling plants at our mobile core sites.\n\nIn our local exchanges, we're installing and upgrading cooling plants with adiabatic units, which use fresh air and water evaporation, making us less reliant on refrigerant gases. They work best on the hottest days - well suited to the rising ambient temperatures of different warming scenarios from 2030-2050. This year we've invested \u00a35m on cooling system upgrades for local exchanges.\n\nTo reduce energy costs from cooling, we've increased the base temperature in sites across our network while maintaining optimal temperatures for our equipment.\n\n## More intense, longer and more frequent extreme weather events\n\nOur extreme weather processes minimise service disruption. We continually scan the weather horizon to get early warning of potential weather-related risks, allowing us to prepare and launch defences. In extreme weather, our processes help us manage risks and prioritise restoring services - so customer impacts are minimised.\n\nWe had ten extreme weather events in the winter of 2023/24. Our preparation, management and strong infrastructure made sure they caused no major service disruptions.\n\nWe track storm, temperature, rainfall and impact data. We use it alongside climate projections to calculate current and future risks.\n\n## Supply chain disruption from physical climate risks\n\nThis year we assessed physical climate risks in our supply chain. We have strong supply management risk processes in place. They include comprehensive supplier due diligence, engaging with and challenging key suppliers on pricing and supply chain diversity, and demand planning and forecasting.\n\n## Managing our transition risks and opportunities\n\nCutting emissions in our value chain and hitting our net zero targets should mitigate the impact of carbon pricing, cost of capital, energy pricing volatility and reputation risks. It will also support the UK's commitment to becoming a net zero economy by 2050. Our carbon reduction plan explains what we're doing to cut our operational and value chain emissions.\n\nSee bt.com/carbonreductionplan for more information.\n\n## Changing consumer preferences and how they see us\n\nWe track changing customer preferences. We reflect this in how we engage with them and how we talk about our climate progress in customer communications and bids.\n\nAs well as opportunities around strategy and targets, our climate change actions help us stand out from the competition. We were one of the first companies to join initiatives like RE100, the CDP supply chain programme, and 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders.\n\nSupportive policies are critical to both our group and wider society to keep within the 1.5\u00b0C warming limit. So we work with regulators and policymakers to advocate for regulation to create this policy environment.\n\nWe also work with peers through associations like GSMA, techUK, Joint Audit Cooperation and the European Green Digital Coalition to build knowledge and expertise on ICT's potential to help decarbonise other sectors. We work with policymakers too to inspire others (like small and medium-sized enterprises) to take climate action.\n\n## Carbon pricing and taxation\n\nWe're not directly in the scope of a carbon pricing scheme. But we track developments and prices in the UK and other relevant jurisdictions.",

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate - related Financial Disclosures continued\n\n## Cost of capital\n\nThe Board oversees our debt status. We also have formal treasury risk management processes, delegated approvals and lender relationship management to manage credit risk across the group - including climate-related risks.\n\nOn the equity side, we engage regularly with shareholders through our investor relations team - including discussions on our ESG performance.\n\n## Carbon abatement solutions\n\nThere are lots of ways for customers to cut their carbon emissions (and associated climate risks) through our products and services. Most of our solutions reduce the need to travel, lower energy use and cut material and manufacturing needs.\n\nPartnering with sustainability tech company QiO, we've launched an AI-powered edge computing solution to help our business customers cut carbon by optimising their energy use.\n\nWe've also introduced real-time energy and carbon dashboards for bigger customers to help them estimate their networks' carbon footprints and cut emissions. We're collaborating with Johnson Controls to help customers digitalise their buildings and optimise their heating, ventilation and cooling systems to reduce energy and carbon.\n\n## Energy pricing and efficiency\n\nTransforming our operating model includes making the group as energy efficient as possible. And we've already done a lot to cut our energy consumption.\n\nWe've decommissioned redundant or underused network infrastructure and upgraded existing infrastructure to boost capacity with less energy. We've used machine learning to make incremental energy savings, and replaced supporting mechanical and electrical infrastructure (heating, cooling, and lighting) with more energy-efficient alternatives.\n\nWe're also moving to fewer, more efficient buildings. And longerterm, the switch to full fibre will need fewer exchanges and other network sites - cutting our network's overall energy consumption.\n\nClimate change, and other macroeconomic factors like war in Ukraine, expose us to fluctuating energy prices that we must manage. So our target is for UK (excluding Northern Ireland) energy demand to be at least 80% hedged a quarter before the start of the next financial year - and 50% hedged for the following financial year.\n\nIn each financial year, we aim to build our Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and virtual Power Purchase Agreement (vPPA) portfolio and explore five to ten year contract opportunities. We complement that by monitoring markets and forward purchasing electricity when the market is right.\n\n## The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our financial planning\n\nOur medium term plan considers both capital and operating expenditure over a rolling five-year timeframe.\n\nThe plan includes our investments on renewable electricity, transforming our buildings estate, making our network more resilient, energy efficiency and switching to a low carbon fleet. This helps us mitigate the potential impact of the bigger risks affecting our business and support our Manifesto goals. We also include projected revenue from carbon abatement solutions in our medium term plan.\n\n## How we manage climate risks\n\n## A structured and consistent approach to risk management\n\nWe identify, assess, manage, and monitor climate-related risks through our risk management framework.\n\nWe consider three types of risk:\n\n- 1. Enduring risks that won't change much over time.\n- 2. Point dynamic risks which change quickly over time.\n- 3. Emerging uncertainties that might emerge over longer timeframes.\n\nWe could face climate-related risks in all these risk types, which we track and report to the Audit & Risk Committee and Executive Committee.\n\nYou can read more about all of our overall GRCs on pages 63 to 70.\n\n## Identifying and assessing risks\n\nWe've identified climate-related risks in several GRCs.\n\nThey include operational resilience (like more flooding, more intense, longer and more frequent heatwaves), stakeholder management (like changing consumer preferences, and how they see us), supply management (like supply chain disruption from physical climate risks) and health, safety & environment. We identify those risks through bottom-up and top-down discussions in our units - and across the whole group. This includes existing and emerging regulatory requirements relating to sustainability, such as upcoming reporting requirements from the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\nWe judge point risks based on their potential impact and how likely they are to happen in the next three years. We judge emerging risks based on their potential impact, the timeframe over which a risk could manifest (which could be beyond the three-year horizon of point risks) and our level of preparedness.\n\nWe calculate the impact for both risk types with quantitative and qualitative measures around financial impact, customer experience and stakeholder perception. This helps us decide the relative weight we give each risk.\n\n## Managing and reporting on risks\n\nOnce we've identified and assessed risks we give them an owner, depending on their priority. These owners decide the things we need to do to respond - like assigning controls, contingencies and monitoring activities.\n\nOwners also regularly improve their action plans by checking metrics and other monitoring activities. This helps them understand future changes that might be needed - like taking new actions, escalating issues or updating assessment processes.\n\nFor emerging climate risks that are more uncertain and apply across several parts of the business, we have an established climate change emerging risk hub. It brings together people from across the group in a forum to discuss developments and agree actions.",

The Board believe that this is an appropriate timeframe as it aligns with the primary focus of our business and financial planning.\n\nThe assessment of viability is based on our medium term plan which forecasts the group's profitability, cash flows and funding requirements, and is approved by the Board at the end of each year. The medium term plan is built from bottom-up business plans and financial forecasts of each of our Customer Facing Units (CFUs) and our Corporate Units (CUs) based on some central macroeconomic assumptions such as inflation and exchange rates. This is then supplemented by items managed at a group level. The macroeconomic assumptions are informed by independent third party forecasts. The performance of the group, our CFUs and our CUs against these forecasts is monitored monthly and this is supplemented each quarter through a series of quarterly business reviews of each unit conducted by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBeyond our medium term planning horizon, the group also makes investments that have business cases covering a longer time period, such as our network investments. Significant capital expenditure investment cases are approved by the Chief Executive and, where appropriate, the Board, after taking into account longer-term risks and opportunities such as the economy, technology and regulation.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur medium term plan has been stress tested in a series of individual severe but plausible downside scenarios, each aligned to our group risk categories as set out on pages 63 to 70. This was followed by stress testing our forecasts against a combined scenario of correlated risks using a stochastic model. Finally, we then identified several mitigations that could realistically be taken by the business to avoid or reduce the impact of the underlying risk.\n\n## Scenarios included in our combined severe but plausible stress test\n\nOur hypothetical combined downside scenario is based on hostilities in the Middle East escalating into a wider conflict. US and other Western allies' involvement in the conflict increases and geopolitical relations between the West and Russia and China worsen. China increases military activities and blockades trading routes with Taiwan at the start of the five-year viability period. The combined effects on energy security and supply chain disruption lead to higher inflation, slower growth and recession which intensify cost-of-living pressures as well as increasing cyber and sanctions compliance risks. Increasing fixed infrastructure wholesale competition from alternative FTTP network providers materially impacts market share. Meanwhile, a hyperscaler makes direct moves into our markets. These impacts lead to additional pension payments being required. We fail to defend successfully the high value litigation claims brought against the group.\n\nThe individual scenarios selected for inclusion in the combined scenario were chosen based on some partial correlations and the current headwinds facing the group and the industry.\n\n| Scenario                                            | Risk Category                              | Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Winter power  shortages                             | Operational  resilience                    | A crisis in the energy sector leads to insufficient gas supply and energy volatility Assumptions:  - 35% of Britain to experience daily outages for up to 60 days  - Telecommunications companies not prioritised for service                                                                                     |\n| Supply chain  disruption                            | Supply management                          | Supply chains are disrupted due to blockage of trading routes Assumptions:  - Chinese blockades of trading routes with Taiwan slows but does not stop supply chain  - Hostilities in Middle East have limited impact outside of global shipping impacts                                                           |\n| International trade  sanctions and  export controls | Legal compliance                           | Discovery of breaches of sanctions or export controls imposed by UK, US or EU nations  Assumptions:  - Trigger for the scenario occurs in the first year  - Widespread problem in two or more units leading to unintentional but significant  breaches                                                            |\n| Recession                                           | Financing and  Communications  Regulations | The UK market experiences a significant recession with negative GDP growth.

We applied an 80th percentile confidence interval which allows for a stress test of the medium term plan with a plausible but still severe combination of events, without assuming the worst impact happens across all scenarios at the same time.  The output of the 80th percentile confidence interval is around 40% of the total sum of these individual risks.\n\n## Results\n\nApplying our severe but plausible combined scenario with related mitigations indicates that BT would experience a liquidity shortage commencing in the second year. However, there are further mitigations, including planned debt issuance, that could be applied to eliminate this liquidity shortage. We would need to adopt around a third of the mitigations we have identified to maintain positive cash flow over the full five-year period of the assessment.\n\nThe mitigations directly in our control primarily revolve around reducing operating and capital expenditure cash outflow from the group. In addition, there are also several mitigations which are outside of our control like raising debt. The Board believe that it is reasonable to expect that it could continue to access debt capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it falls due, or to renew our undrawn committed facility (which expires in March 2027, before the end of the viability period). If access to debt markets wasn't available, then equity capital markets would be considered as an alternative to raise funds.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period of their assessment.\n\nThe directors also considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements, as set out in the 'Report of directors' on page 126.",

We are cognisant of the new Code and are well placed to ensure our governance practices across the group are strengthened in line with this and evolving best practice.\n\nThe Board prioritises effective corporate governance across the group. Promoting fairness, openness and transparency in its responsibilities to stakeholders and generating long-term, sustainable success has been, and will remain, the Board's primary objective.\n\nThe Board has been educated on the key changes coming out of the new Code, published in January 2024. We're well placed to build on our corporate governance practices to comply with the Code in future years, and to ensure the Board is carrying out its role in governing the group effectively. In next year's report we'll provide an update on how the priorities of the Board and committees have been shaped by the new Code in FY25.\n\nThis Corporate governance report sets out the approach our Board takes to facilitate effective governance and how it supports our strategy and the decisions we have made, ensuring it considers the interests of our stakeholders and our contribution to society.\n\n## Board and committee changes\n\n- - Philip Jansen stepped down from the Board and as Chief Executive at the end of January. I'd like to take this time to thank Philip for the excellent job he has done during his time at BT Group and in leading our transformation.\n- - We welcomed Allison Kirkby to the role of Chief Executive in February, having served on the Board since 2019. We're delighted to have Allison lead the group and I look forward to supporting her as we drive our long-term strategy (see page 96 for details on Allison's appointment).\n- - As mentioned in last year's report, Ian Cheshire and Iain Conn stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Adel Al-Saleh also stepped down in December 2023 and Isabel Hudson will step down at the conclusion of the 2024 AGM in July after serving nine years on the Board. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them all for their valuable contributions to the Board and to the group over the years and wish them well in their future endeavours.\n- - Ruth Cairnie joined the Board in April 2023 and, from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, succeeded Iain as the Senior Independent Director and Ian as Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n- - Raphael K\u00fcbler was appointed to the Board in January 2024 having been put forward by Deutsche Telekom as their nominated director.\n- - We appointed Tushar Morzaria to the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 7 May 2024. Tushar brings a wealth of strategic financial management experience gained over 25 years where he has overseen transformation programmes and has strengthened risk and control frameworks.\n\nWith these Board changes, we have focused on complementing the existing skills on the Board, and ensuring the best mix of diversity of viewpoints, skills and experience. More details on succession planning and the work of the Nominations Committee during the year can be found on pages 96 to 98.\n\nDuring the year, the Board has also made some changes to simplify our Board and Committee structure. After careful consideration, it was decided that it was the appropriate time to disband the BT Compliance Committee and to transition its responsibilities across the Audit & Risk and Responsible Business Committee s. More detail on this can be found on pages 99 and 105.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues\n\nThis has continued to be a challenging year for our colleagues; the Board recognised this and held many colleague-focused discussions during the year.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the Board decided to make changes to our colleague engagement mechanism and establish a comprehensive colleague outreach programme led by the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement. As part of this change, the Colleague Board was disbanded during the year. Maggie Chan Jones was appointed as our new Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, succeeding Isabel, who will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2024 AGM. Maggie's previous experience, focus on coaching, and her championship of diversity, inclusivity and other colleague matters will help ensure that the voices of our colleagues continue to be heard in the boardroom. I'd like to thank Isabel for all of her support and guidance to the Colleague Board and our colleagues, over the past four years. Further detail on how the Board made this decision and how it engages with our colleagues can be found on pages 90 to 91.\n\n## Inclusion, equity and diversity\n\nWe are committed to encouraging inclusive thinking inside and outside of our business. This year, we have made progress in ethnic minority representation, with decent gains against the bold targets set out in our Manifesto. For more information on our continued progress in this area, see pages 31 to 32 and 34 to 39.\n\nThe Board's diversity targets are set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy. As at 31 March 2024, our Board comprised 50% female directors, two directors from an ethnic minority background, and one who has a disability. Ruth Cairnie's appointment during the year as the Senior Independent Director ensured that we met the requirements of the Listing Rules to have female representation in at least one of the four senior board positions. This position was reinforced by Allison's appointment as Chief Executive from 1 February 2024, meaning that half of the four senior board positions are now held by women. From the 2024 AGM, our Board will comprise 40% female directors, three directors from an ethnic minority background, and one who has a disability.\n\nLeading this Board and our business continues to be a privilege. I would like to thank all our BT Group teams for their continued efforts to help us deliver on our purpose and I am excited to work with a fantastic group of fellow directors over the next year.\n\n## Adam Crozier\n\nChairman\n\n15 May 2024",

The Colleague Board continued to successfully contribute to, and shape, some of our key initiatives this year by sharing different views and perspectives. This helped the Board and senior leadership to understand the perspectives of our colleagues on a range of different topics, and supported good decision-making practices. There was a Q&A session at each meeting which enabled Colleague Board members to ask questions of the Chief Executive and Isabel and provided an opportunity for Colleague Board members to further understand key issues impacting the group and our colleagues.\n\nAs in previous years, the Colleague Board was chaired by the Chief Executive. Members included Isabel and a number of colleagues from a diverse range of roles across the group. Sabine Chalmers, BT Group General Counsel, Company Secretary & Director Regulatory Affairs, and Athalie Williams, Chief Human Resources Officer, and two Openreach colleagues were also invited and attended all formal meetings. Other members of the Executive Committee attended meetings on a rotating basis and the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors were able to attend meetings as observers. The Director of Internal Communications was invited to attend Colleague Board meetings and members were encouraged to feedback on key internal communications. The Deputy Company Secretary was secretary to the Colleague Board and he, or his delegate, attended all meetings and provided support, guidance and advice as required.\n\nThe last formal Colleague Board meeting was held in November 2023. A final meeting with members was held with Isabel, Maggie and Allison in February 2024 to thank Isabel and the Colleague Board members for their efforts over the years and to discuss the key topics for both Maggie, as the new Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, and Allison, as Chief Executive, to be aware of going forward.\n\n## Key topics discussed in FY24\n\n| People  framework, pay  and benefits   | Colleague feedback on the people  framework, pay and benefits and a deep dive  session was hosted by the Director of Group  Reward.                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inclusion, equity  and diversity       | The group's progress on inclusion, equity  and diversity and the future priorities and  insight was fed back to Isabel for future  consideration during Board meetings.                                                            |\n| Hybrid working                         | Colleague sentiment on the hybrid working  principles and how consistently this is  applied across the group.                                                                                                                      |\n| Colleague  engagement  surveys         | The move from annually to quarterly Your  Say colleague engagement surveys. The  Board asked  Colleague Board  members to  encourage colleagues to complete the  condensed surveys and communicate the  importance of the results. |\n\n| Business  integration                 | The integration of Enterprise and Global  forming Business, and the challenges  brought about by this change, including  impacts on colleagues, whilst recognising  the overall benefits to the group.                                           |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 'Speak Up  Because We Care'  campaign | Consideration of the campaign, which was a  Colleague Board  request to address peer to  peer engagement on internal digital  platforms. The Board recognised that  engagement between colleagues has been  positively impacted by the campaign, |\n| Travel and  expenses                  | Colleague feedback on the changes made to  the travel and expenses policy. HR and  Finance subsequently carried out a review  and made the appropriate updates to ensure  the policy remains suitable for colleagues.                            |\n\n## Colleague Board engagement\n\n## With the Board\n\nAt each formal Colleague Board meeting, the Board (via Isabel) and/or management had the opportunity to discuss topics on which they would like the Colleague Board members' perspectives. Colleague Board members shared their insights on 'hot topics' in order to bring these to the attention of the Board and/or management. The Colleague Board raised and discussed a variety of topics, including those in the table above. Isabel reported back to the Board and its Committees, as appropriate, on the discussions, providing the Board with a direct insight into colleague perspectives to help inform its decision making. During the year, Isabel updated the Remuneration Committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related discussions. The Colleague Board meeting materials and notes of the meetings were also made available to the Board.\n\nThe Chief Executive and Executive Committee members' attendance, as well as the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, allowed for a mutual exchange of information, especially in relation to current 'hot topics', which was fed back into the Board and Executive Committee' s discussions and decision-making process throughout the year. One example was the feedback the Colleague Board provided on the pay review during the year which was discussed at both Colleague Board and Board meetings, ahead of a decision.\n\nSince its inception, the Colleague Board has been used alongside other colleague engagement mechanisms which will continue to be utilised and enhanced going forward. See page 41 for more information on how we engage with colleagues.\n\n## With our colleagues\n\nColleague Board members fed back to colleagues on the discussions from formal meetings as well as highlighting any other issues raised between meetings. Members were encouraged to connect via internal engagement channels including the People Networks and by reviewing the outputs of the Your Say engagement surveys to obtain an increased and broader understanding of colleagues' views.\n\nEach Colleague Board member was invited to join the senior leadership team calls hosted by the Chief Executive throughout the year to give them additional perspectives on the group's performance and strategic decisions.",

During the year, as part of a review of our governance structures carried out by the Chairman, supported by the Company Secretary, the Board concluded that it was the appropriate time to re-evaluate the workforce engagement mechanism best suited to the group.\n\nThe Board considered the workforce engagement structure and found that, whilst the Colleague Board has delivered on its aims to bring the colleague voice into the boardroom, a number of alternative approaches are available. The Board considered a number of factors including the overlap of the Colleague Board 's role with other colleague engagement mechanisms across the group, especially the change in frequency of the Your Say engagement surveys from annually to quarterly, and also the amount of work the Colleague Board members were undertaking to represent the colleague voice.\n\nAfter deliberation, the Board concluded that the Colleague Board should be disbanded and that the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement should engage in a comprehensive colleague outreach programme which will utilise the existing colleague engagement mechanisms across the group. The Board recognised the key role the Colleague Board has played in bringing the colleague voice into the boardroom for the last four years, and are appreciative of the passion and commitment of Colleague Board members over the years in aiming to make BT Group a better workplace for all.\n\nAdditionally, as part of this review, and in light of Isabel's tenure on the Board, it was considered an appropriate time to appoint a new Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement. Maggie was appointed to succeed Isabel and will bring to the role her personal experience and insight, her focus on coaching, and her championship of diversity, inclusivity and other colleague matters.\n\nAfter another challenging year for our colleagues, I would like to thank the Colleague Board members for their continued contributions and valuable insight into colleague sentiment, which I have shared with the Board throughout the year. The thought-provoking questions and constructive challenges have greatly benefitted the Board's decision-making process. I would like to congratulate Maggie on her new role and I am confident she will continue to ensure the voices of colleagues are clearly heard in the boardroom.\n\n## Isabel Hudson\n\nDesignated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement and a member of the Colleague Board (2019-2024)\n\n## Colleague engagement mechanism - FY25 and beyond\n\nMaggie will be undertaking a series of colleague engagement activities throughout FY25. The purpose of this engagement is to listen and understand colleagues' views and perspectives, and enable her to communicate these back to the Board and integrate them into decision-making. Through this, the Board will continue to obtain direct insights into colleague sentiment at all stages of the decision-making process.\n\nMaggie will receive a quarterly written report collated by the People, Ethics & Compliance team which will utilise the rich variety of data sources available on colleague sentiment across the group, including Your Say engagement survey results, inclusion, equity and diversity data, and internal communications insight reports. Whilst this report will be collated for Maggie as the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, she may consider it appropriate to share this with the wider Board.\n\nThe People, Ethics & Compliance team will also schedule regular colleague engagement sessions with Maggie to take place throughout FY25, through in person visits and virtual calls. During these sessions, colleagues will be encouraged to share personal views and experiences. These sessions will include meetings with the People Network leads, Trade Union representatives, and attending internal events. Sessions will also be scheduled with members of the reward team as appropriate, and in line with colleague events and ahead of colleague-related Board discussions, to ensure Maggie has insight into the colleague sentiment on relevant topics.\n\nIn 2024, as part of Maggie's Board induction programme, Maggie visited two contact centres in Tyneside and Gosforth and listened in on customer calls and digital chats and participated in two town hall meetings with colleagues based at those locations. More information on Maggie's induction programme can be found on page 95.\n\nThe reports, together with the colleague engagement sessions, will enable Maggie to provide the Board with a holistic view of colleague sentiment across the group, and help ensure that the colleague voice is represented in the boardroom.\n\nThe effectiveness of engagement with our colleagues will be kept under review in FY25 and changes will be made where appropriate.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my first colleague engagement experiences and I am looking forward to engaging with our colleagues across the group. We are fortunate to have a wealth of insightful data available to provide an overview of our colleagues' sentiment and I shall pair this with personal experience stories to provide the Board with a well rounded picture. My goal is to ensure that the colleague voice is represented in the boardroom and is considered throughout the Board's decision-making process. Our colleagues are our most important asset and I am passionate about making sure they are able to inform the decisions we make toward success.\n\n## Maggie Chan Jones\n\nDesignated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement",

        "page_content": "## Section 172 statement\n\nIn their discussions and decisions during FY24, the directors of BT Group plc have acted in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the group for the benefit of its members as a whole, having regard to stakeholders and the matters set out in sub-sections 172(1) (a)-(f) of the 2006 Act.\n\nThe Board considers the matters set out in section 172 of the 2006 Act in its discussions and decision making, including:\n\n## The likely consequence of any decision in the longterm:\n\n- - The Directors recognise that the decisions they make today will affect the group's long-term success. During the year, the Board had particular regard to this in its discussions on group strategy (see page 89). Our purpose and strategy demonstrate how we realise our ambition and grow value for all our stakeholders. This in turn guides the Board's decisions, specifically the balance between short and long-term investments. The third pillar of our strategy - lead the way to a bright, sustainable future incorporates our aim to identify and develop new business opportunities that will help us grow sustainably in the future. More information on our strategy can be found on pages 18 to 29.\n\n## The impact of the group's operations on the community and environment:\n\n- - The Responsible Business Committee continues to oversee the progress of our Manifesto. This aims to accelerate growth through technology that is responsible, inclusive and sustainable, ensuring the group can continue to build trust and create value for its stakeholders. The Committee also monitors progress on the digital impact and sustainability strategy and our sustainability goals. During the year, the Committee considered and approved the group's Carbon Abatement Methodology which formalises our goal to help our customers avoid 60m tonnes of carbon emissions through our products and services (see page 105).\n- - Information as to how we have addressed the recommendation of the TCFD framework can be found on pages 71 to 80.\n\n## The desirability of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct:\n\n- - The Board acknowledges its responsibility for setting and monitoring the culture, values and reputation of the group. Our colleagues are central to us achieving this ambition and we're focused on building a culture where our colleagues can be their best. During the year, the Board considered the group's culture in its decision making and discussions (see page 88).\n- - The Audit & Risk Committee also considered regular reports from the General Counsel People, Ethics & Compliance on our ethics and compliance policies and programmes and reports on issues raised through Speak Up, BT Group's confidential whistleblowing service (see page 102).\n\n## The interests of our colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with our key stakeholders :\n\n- - The Board and its Committees understand the strategic importance of stakeholders to our business. When making decisions, the Directors have regard to the interests of colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with other key stakeholders. We acknowledge that not every decision we make will necessarily result in a positive outcome for all our stakeholders, so the Board must balance competing interests in reaching its decisions.\n- - While the Board engages directly with stakeholders on some issues, the size and distribution of BT Group and our stakeholder groups means that stakeholder engagement often happens below Board level. However, the Board considers information from across the group to help it understand how our operations affect our stakeholders' interests and views. More details on how we engage with key stakeholders (including customers and suppliers) on pages 40 to 45.\n- - Our colleagues are key to our success, and they are considered as part of the Board's discussions and decision making. The Board and its Committees have reviewed colleague health and wellbeing, our inclusivity, equity and diversity ambitions, organisational culture and the impact of our transformation programmes, as well as on employee relations (see pages 30 to 33  for more details). More information on the Board's engagement with colleagues can be found on pages 90 to 91 and other colleague engagement channels are set out on page 41.\n\n## The need to act fairly between BT Group's shareholders:\n\n- - During FY24, the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, other executives and the Investor Relations team held 222 meetings with investors (see page 43 for more detail on our engagement with shareholders). These meetings gave investors the opportunity to discuss views on all matters including:\n- - our strategy and competitive position in key markets\n- - our financial and operational performance\n- - capital investment (including FTTP and 5G)\n- - our capital allocation policy\n- - prospective governmental and regulatory policy decisions\n\n- our pension fund valuation.\n\n- - The Board is mindful of having two significant shareholders but considers any decisions it makes in the interests of all shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Decisions made during the year\n\nThe following are some of the decisions made by the Board during the year which demonstrate how section 172 matters have been taken into account as part of Board discussions and decision making:\n\nDecision\n\nWhat happened\n\n## Sale of BT Tower to MCR London Holdings Limited\n\n## BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) triennial valuation\n\nThe Board was kept updated on negotiations with the BTPS Trustee on the triennial funding valuation as at 30 June 2023. This included consideration of the range of possible funding deficit outcomes and the associated deficit repair contributions. The Board was also reminded of its obligations under the Pension Schemes Act 2021 and the approach of the Pensions Regulator.\n\nThe Board considered the contractual protections previously provided to the BTPS and their prospective suitability. Specifically, the Board considered the circumstances in which it would be obliged to make additional payments to the BTPS because of cash disposals, dividends or share buy-backs made. The Board also reviewed the stabiliser mechanism and co-investment vehicle established as part of the 30 June 2020 valuation, and considered the likelihood of additional payments being triggered and future refunds being received.\n\nThe Board considered the group's capital allocation framework and the associated impact on its key stakeholders. The Board noted the need to balance its objective to invest for growth, whilst supporting the BT pension funds, maintaining a strong balance sheet and rewarding investors through its progressive dividend policy. In October 2023, after careful consideration, the Board approved the proposed package of measures which would form the 2023 valuation.\n\nImpacts of prior Board decision: funding of increased and accelerated FTTP build plan from 20m to 25m premises by December 2026\n\nSummary of decision: In 2020, the Board approved the increase of our FTTP build to 20m premises, subject to the outcome of Ofcom's Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review (WFTMR). Post the WFTMR, in May 2021, the Board further approved an increased and accelerated FTTP build to 25m premises by the end of December 2026. This was a difficult decision and in making it, the Board considered competing stakeholder interests, including the benefits to our customers, colleagues and shareholders, the impact on communities and the desire to support the Government's fibre ambitions.\n\nImpacts and outcomes: As a result of this Board decision, our rollout of the FTTP network now passes 13.8m homes and businesses, helping to better connect our customers. This year, we passed an average of 68,000 premises per week. 4.7m customers have now moved across and are enjoying the service and benefits of full fibre.\n\nOur full fibre network now also passes 3.9m rural premises a , which has added value to local communities and helped bring people together, supporting our purpose of we connect for good. We brought full fibre broadband to Fair Isle, one of the UK's most geographically remote islands and Openreach had to reroute the build by 100km, in order to avoid protected landscapes and bird nesting season.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of this Board decision, our rollout of the FTTP network now passes 13.8m homes and businesses, helping to better connect our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na Rural premises are defined according to Ofcom's Area 3 classification.\n\nDuring the year, the Board discussed in detail the proposal to sell the BT Tower to MCR London Holdings Limited, in particular:\n\n- - the need for future investment in the maintenance of the BT Tower\n- - how this fits with the simplification of the group's property portfolio\n- - the costs and timescale for exiting the BT Tower\n- - the plans that had been put in place to mitigate risks to the network functionality of the BT Tower\n- - the approach that would be taken to relocate impacted colleagues who are currently based at the BT Tower\n- - the brand association element of the transaction, including the risks associated with permitting the use of the BT brand and, if permitted, ensuring that relevant brand protections are in place\n- - the broader potential reputational impact of the sale.\n\nOn balance, the Board considered the long-term benefits of the sale, including the reduction in property running costs, and agreed that these outweighed any risks. Having carefully considered the transaction terms, in February 2024, the Board approved the sale of the BT Tower to MCR London Holdings Limited for \u00a3275m with an anticipated completion date in FY30.",

Given the changing composition of the Board (including a new Chief Executive) we did not feel it was the right time for a once in three year external evaluation. We therefore engaged Lintstock Limited on a multi-year basis. Lintstock is an accredited Board Performance Reviewer of the Chartered Governance Institute, with no other links to the group. This year, they facilitated an evaluation of our Board and Committees via questionnaires.\n\nA more thorough, interview-based review by Lintstock, will take place in FY25, at which point there will be a more stable foundation in our Board to review and in turn, the evaluation will provide greater value in terms of forward looking focus areas.\n\n## FY24 Evaluation Process\n\nTailored questionnaires were circulated to members, regular attendees and the secretary of the Board and each of its Committees. The Executive Committee and CEO, Openreach also completed an evaluation to provide their perspectives on the effectiveness of, and relationship with, the Board. The evaluations were prepared by Lintstock in line with best practice. These focused on composition, dynamics, succession and how well-placed the Board is to add value to the business, in terms of how it oversees strategy, risk management, colleagues, culture and performance. Focus was also given to core areas of governance, the Board's decision making processes, as well as how well it considers stakeholders as part of its discussions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Senior Independent Director undertook a discussion with the other Non-Executive Directors and Deputy Company Secretary, without the Chairman present, to obtain their feedback and views of the Chairman's performance during the year.

This is tailored to take into account the director's previous experience, their responsibilities and, for each Non-Executive Director, the specific responsibilities relevant to their Committee memberships. The programme includes meetings with the Chairman, Board members, the Executive Committee and senior management. Directors also receive key information on our strategy and KPIs, governance framework, the regulatory framework in which we operate, recent financial performance, risk management and internal control systems and the policies supporting our business practices.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to visit our different hubs, contact centres and BT/EE retail shops, as well as spend a day with an Openreach engineer.\n\nDetails on the Board changes made during the year can be found in the Nominations Committee Chair's Report on page 97.\n\n## Maggie and Ruth's inductions\n\nMaggie and Ruth joined the Board on 1 March and 6 April 2023 respectively as Independent Non-Executive Directors. Maggie is the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement and Ruth was appointed as Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Both Maggie and Ruth are members of the Nominations Committee , Maggie is a member of the Responsible Business Committee and Ruth is a member of the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nMaggie and Ruth received an induction pack with key reference materials that provided them with a thorough understanding of BT Group, including the most recent financial results, information on our strategy and each of our business units, the governance framework, director responsibilities, ethical policies and the Commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe part that's always the most impactful for me was seeing and experiencing our teams in action.\n\nMaggie Chan Jones Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement\n\nThroughout their first few months on the Board, Maggie and Ruth individually held a number of induction meetings including with the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, and members of the Executive Committee and key senior leaders, including the Director of Investor Relations, the heads of the business units, as well as the CEO, Openreach. The sessions included the following areas:\n\n- - Group Strategy\n- - Consumer\n- - Business\n- - Openreach\n- - Corporate Affairs\n- - Digital, Data & AI\n- - Security & Networks\n- - HR & our colleagues\n- - Financial processes, funding and risk management\n- - Regulatory context\n- - Governance.\n\nIn addition, Ruth met with the Group Director of Reward given her role as Chair of the Remuneration Committe e and Matthew Key, in his capacity as Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nIn May 2023, Maggie and Ruth joined Clive Selley, CEO, Openreach on an Openreach field visit in different locations across London and Essex, which provided them with a deeper insight into our fibre rollout and the experiences of colleagues in these roles.\n\nIn February 2024, Maggie and Ruth visited our Tyneside and Gosforth contact centres. They met with a range of colleagues and benefitted from seeing our strategic plans for the customer facing, front line part of the business come to life. They listened in on customer calls and digital chats and were guest speakers at the two colleague town hall meetings where they had the opportunity to listen to colleagues and answer questions. For Maggie, as the new Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, this visit was invaluable in providing her with a better understanding of BT Group priorities and our strategy relating to colleagues.

As a result, a sub-set of the Committee spent significant time building on the Board's succession plans and focusing on appointing the next Chief Executive, which ultimately culminated in Allison's appointment.\n\nIn the first half of the year, we commenced a formal succession process to appoint the next Chief Executive, to succeed Philip Jansen. As Chairman, I led the process, with a sub-set of the Committee. Allison was not present for any of these discussions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpencer Stuart, an independent external search agency, who has no other connection to the BT Group, or any of the Directors, was appointed to facilitate the process.

        "page_content": "## Non-Executive Director appointments\n\nThe Committee also spent time considering additional NonExecutive Directors. Russell Reynolds Associates, an independent external search consultant, who has no other connection to the BT Group, and who is a signatory of the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, was engaged to assist with the search.\n\nIn light of changes to the Board over the past year, the Committee prioritised the skills, experience and background when considering new Board appointments. As such, the search was predominantly for candidates with financial experience to supplement the capabilities of the Audit & Risk Committee , especially in light of Allison stepping down from the Committee on her appointment as Chief Executive, CEO experience potentially in a transformation focused role, and regulatory experience. As in all searches, diversity continued to be a key consideration. Russell Reynolds was tasked with enabling us to make appointments that meet the aims and targets of our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy and related targets and succession planning.\n\nIn line with the brief, the Committee agreed a shortlist of candidates with Russell Reynolds, with discussions held around ensuring the shortlist was diverse from both a gender and ethnicity perspective. A sub-set of the Committee was formed to lead the process, comprising of the Senior Independent Director (and Chair of the Remuneration Committee ), and the Chairs of the Audit & Risk and Responsible Business Committees , as well as the Chief Executive.\n\nFurther to a comprehensive benchmarking, assessment and interview process, the sub-committee discussed feedback and made its recommendation to the Board. In April 2024, on recommendation from the Committee, the Board approved in principle the appointment of Tushar Morzaria as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Final approval was delegated to the Chairman and Company Secretary and they subsequently approved Tushar's appointment with effect from 7 May 2024. Tushar brings a wealth of strategic financial management experience to our Board, gained over 25 years where he has overseen transformation programmes and has strengthened risk and control frameworks. Tushar is a member of the Audit & Risk Committee and has recent and relevant financial experience in line with the Code, as well as being a member of this Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Committee and the Board considered Tushar's other external commitments as part of this appointment process and more details on this can be found opposite.\n\n## Executive Committee succession planning and talent\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee reviewed:\n\n- - and approved the creation of a new Executive Committee role reporting to the Chief Executive titled the Chief Strategy and Change Officer to lead a new Strategy and Change unit. The purpose of the Chief Strategy and Change Officer role is to:\n- - drive the development of BT Group's corporate strategy\n- - ensure alignment of Unit strategies with the corporate strategy\n- - develop a single, aligned strategic narrative and equity story for BT Group\n- - define, drive and integrate critical, cross-Unit change programmes to deliver against the BT Group objectives.\n- - the performance and succession planning of Executive Committee members. The Committee continues to focus on broader Executive Committee succession planning, including oversight of the talent pipeline with a focus on diversity\n- - key talent at the senior leadership level. The Committee reflected on the importance of identifying critical roles and building stronger and broader diversity of experience, gender and ethnicity, as well as commercial, technology and transformation capabilities, both through potential external candidates and through our internal talent pipeline\n- - external appointments of Executive Committee members, in line with our policy on external interests for Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) and the CEO, Openreach. Under this policy, proposed external directorships and other significant external\n\ninterests must not be to an organisation that is a BT Group competitor/major supplier to BT Group, create a conflict of interest for the individual with their role at BT Group, involve significant amounts of BT Group working hours or impede the ability of the individual to perform their BT Group role, or involve disproportionate incentives or remuneration, with reference to the time commitment of the role. Any fees or other incentives arising from such appointments may be retained by the individual, subject to the amount being proportionate.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOn accepting their appointment, Directors must confirm they are able to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and any Committees of which they are members, as well as the AGM and Board off-sites. Directors are also expected to devote sufficient time to prepare for each meeting and to participate in other site or office visits to understand the business better. Before accepting new external appointments, directors are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board.\n\nBefore recommending that the Board approve the appointment of Allison Kirkby as Chief Executive, the Committee considered her other commitments, notably her directorship of Brookfield Asset Management Limited. The Committee considered the time commitment to be reasonable and was comfortable that Allison's directorship at Brookfield would not affect her ability to dedicate sufficient time to the group in her new role as Chief Executive or create any conflicts of interest. It's also within the overboarding guidelines published by proxy agencies.\n\nThe Committee also considered Simon Lowth's proposed appointment to the Board of Smith & Nephew as an Independent Non-Executive Director and as a member of their Audit and Nomination & Governance Committees. The Committee considered the role and the time commitment it would require and was comfortable that Simon would still have sufficient time to dedicate to his role at BT Group if he was to take on this external commitment.\n\nAs part of the Committee's decision to appoint Tushar Morzaria to the Board, it thoroughly considered his other commitments, notably his roles as a Non-Executive Director of both Legal & General Group and BP. Tushar also chairs the Audit Committee for both companies. The Committee considered corporate governance guidance including the overboarding guidelines published by proxy agencies. On balance, both the Committee and the Board were comfortable that Tushar's other commitments were acceptable and would not affect his ability to dedicate sufficient time to the group in his new role as a Independent Non-Executive Director or create any conflicts of interest. The Committee and the Board were in agreement that Tushar's skills and experience would be a strong addition to the Board and proceeded to appoint him with effect from 7 May 2024.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nThe Committee considered, in respect of each director, their skills and experience, time commitment and tenure as part of its recommendation to the Board in relation to the directors put forward for election or re-election at the AGM. The Board believes that each director it has recommended to shareholders for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM brings considerable knowledge, wide-ranging skills and experience to the Board, makes an effective and valuable contribution and continues to demonstrate commitment to their role.\n\nOn recommendation from the Committee, the Board also considered the continued independence of Non-Executive Directors as part of its consideration of the re-election recommendations. The Board continues to consider all Non-Executive Directors as being independent in line with the Code, with the exception of Deutsche Telekom's nominated representative. The Chairman was judged to be independent at the time of his appointment.\n\n- Details of directors' contracts or letters of appointment are in the Annual remuneration report on page 121.",

Non-Executive Directors regularly meet with management, enhancing their understanding of the business through briefing sessions. We encourage all Directors to keep their skills and knowledge up to date and to ask for any support they need. As part of ongoing development, the Company Secretary (or her delegate) briefs the Board and its Committees at each meeting, as relevant, on any key legal, regulatory and corporate governance developments. During the year, these briefings included updates on the new Code, institutional investor guidelines, the FTSE Women Leaders Review, the Parker Review and other governance publications. Directors are updated as required on developments in the environment in which the group operates and internal and external advisers are invited to meetings to provide updates as necessary.\n\n## Openreach Limited Board succession\n\nUnder its remit, the Committee has a responsibility to consider changes to the Openreach Limited Board and recommend any changes to the BT Group Board for approval. During the year, the Committee noted that the Openreach Chair and Openreach NonExecutive Directors continue to satisfy the independence criteria and should continue in their roles.\n\n## Inclusion, equity and diversity\n\nThe Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our approach to diversity on the Board and our aim to have a well-balanced Board with the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to meet our business needs and support our strategic aim of building the strongest foundations (see bt.com/governance ).\n\n## The policy ensures we:\n\n- - apply an inclusion lens to all our decision-making processes\n- - monitor the impact of our decisions on diverse populations\n- - value and communicate the benefits that difference brings and are unapologetic in our pursuit of a diverse workforce at all levels\n- - actively seek out opportunities across the business to enhance and strengthen our approach to inclusion.\n\nWhilst we appoint candidates based on merit, we continue to challenge our external search consultants to ensure that all forms of diversity are considered when drawing up candidate lists. This is a key consideration for our searches.\n\nDiversity is considered in the broadest sense and all forms of difference are considered, including age, gender, nationality, independence, professional background, social and ethnic backgrounds, business and geographic experience, as well as cognitive and personal strengths. These are considered in reviewing the composition of the Board and, where possible, are appropriately balanced. We believe a key driver in delivering our diversity commitments across the organisation is through a Board which has this balance of skills, experience, diversity and knowledge.\n\nAs at 31 March 2024, five of our ten Board directors were female (50%), two directors were from an ethnic minority background (20%), and one director has a disability.\n\nRuth Cairnie's appointment during the year as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director ensures that we meet the requirements of the Listing Rules to have female representation in at least one of the four senior board positions. This position was reinforced by Allison's appointment as Chief Executive from 1 February 2024, meaning that half of the four senior board positions are now held by women.\n\nDetails of the group's inclusion, equity and diversity strategy, including its objectives, implementation and progress can be found on pages 31 to 33.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Chairman and Non-Executive Directors' tenure:  As

Further detail on how the Committee has fulfilled these responsibilities will be included in next year's report.\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference available at bt.com/governance\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe Committee members are all Independent Non-Executive Directors with a range of skills, and the Committee as a whole has experience relevant to the sector and acts independently of management. Throughout the year, Allison attended all Committee meetings in her capacity as a Non-Executive Director and both she and I have recent and relevant business and financial experience, in line with the Code, as set out in our biographies. Allison stepped down from the Committee on her appointment as Chief Executive in February 2024. Tushar Morzaria was appointed to the Board and this Committee in May 2024 and has recent and relevant financial experience. The Deputy Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and he, or his delegate, attends all meetings and provides guidance, advice and support as required. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer attend Committee meetings as required.\n\nPrivate Committee sessions with the Non-Executive Directors and the internal and external auditor were held at each meeting without management being present. The external auditor was not present at meetings where their performance and/or their remuneration was discussed.\n\n## Meetings attended\n\n| Matthew Key (Chair)   | 6/6   | Iain Conn  b      | 2/2   |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------------------|-------|\n| Ruth Cairnie  a       | 5/5   | Allison Kirkby  c | 6/6   |\n| Ian Cheshire  b       | 2/2   | Sara Weller       | 6/6   |\n\n- a Ruth joined the Committee on her appointment to the Board on 6 April 2023.\n- b Ian and Iain stepped down from the Board and this Committee at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.\n- c Allison ceased being a member of the Committee when she became Chief Executive on 1 February 2024 but still attends meetings in her capacity as Chief Executive.\n\n## Other attendee (x Regular attendee \u00b7 Attends as required)\n\n| Chief Executive                                                   | \u00d7   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Chief Financial Officer                                           | \u00d7   |\n| Director of External Reporting and Financial Control              | \u00d7   |\n| Director of Group Internal Audit and Group Risk                   | \u00d7   |\n| General Counsel, Company Secretary & Director  Regulatory Affairs | \u00d7   |\n| Group Risk Director                                               | \u00b7   |\n| General Counsel, People, Ethics & Compliance                      | \u00b7   |\n\n- Details on the FY24 Board and Committee evaluation can be found on page 94.\n\n## Committee focus in FY24\n\nThe Committee met six times this year. As Committee Chair, I met with the KPMG lead audit partner, Director of Group Internal Audit and Group Risk, and management as appropriate ahead of meetings to discuss specific items of focus to report to the Committee. After each meeting, I also reported back to the Board on the Committee's activities, the main issues discussed and matters of particular relevance, with the Board receiving copies of the Committee's meeting papers and minutes.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered the full year and half year results, and the Q1 and Q3 trading updates. It reviewed the quality of accounting policies and practices, as well as critical accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nThe Committee considered, and was satisfied with:\n\n- - the processes supporting the preparation and consolidation of the financial statements, including consistent application of the accounting policies, and the ongoing verification by management and the external auditor\n- - management's accounting judgements and the appropriate application of the accounting policies, having also discussed these with the external auditor.\n\nThe Committee exercised its judgement when considering matters related to the financial statements , and recommended approval by the Board of each of our full year and half year results, Q1 and Q3 trading updates and the Annual Report.",

The Committee concluded that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy, and the potential impact on forward-looking assumptions supporting going concern and viability assessments.\n\nIn its assessment, it considered that the following had been carried out and this formed the basis of its recommendation to the Board:\n\n- - a verification process covering the factual content reviewed by the internal audit team\n- - comprehensive reviews by different levels of management, including the Executive Committee , to consider the messaging and ensure consistency and overall balance\n- - independent reviews by the external auditor which did not highlight any material inconsistencies.",

        "page_content": "Significant matters related to the financial statements and how these were addressed:\n\n## Group accounting policies, critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe Committee considered the accounting policies and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements regarding critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements as summarised in note 2 of the financial statements . These include the estimate of our customer refund liability, our goodwill impairment assessment, determining the point of sale of BT Tower, the valuation of our pensions assets and liabilities, taxation, contingent liabilities associated with litigation, provisions, determination of lease terms including reasonable certainty, and valuation of investments in the Sports joint venture. More detail on the Committee's oversight of these matters is set out below where appropriate.\n\n## Going concern assessment\n\nThe Committee considered management's forecasts of group cash flows and net debt, as well as the group's liquidity requirements and borrowing facilities, including downside scenarios from the viability model as discussed below. Following this review and a discussion of the sensitivities, it confirmed that the going concern basis of accounting continues to be an appropriate basis of preparation for the financial statements and ecommended it for approval by the Board. See page 126.\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe Committee reviewed the process and assessment of the group's prospects, taking into account the group's current position and principal risks. The Committee also considered the group risks in management's stress testing model, including the review of downside scenarios and a combined 'severe but plausible' scenario where multiple interconnected risks materialise. The Committee was satisfied that the viability statement could be provided and recommended it for approval by the Board. See pages 81 to 82.\n\n## Litigation provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Committee reviewed contingent liabilities associated with litigation and major contentious matters throughout the year. There has been a noted increase in the value of the gross risk faced by the Group, which is largely as a result of the increasing prevalence of collective proceedings (sometimes known as class actions) in the UK. During the year, the Committee has placed particular focus on understanding and scrutinising legal assessments by the Group's external and internal legal advisers of the claims that have materialised, to ensure the adequacy of its provisions.\n\n## Business revenue\n\nThe Committee considered and discussed the risk of billing inaccuracy and control deficiencies that had been identified in Business in relation to legacy systems and processes. They discussed the impact of these including potential customer impacts. The Committee also spent time understanding the associated potential revenue risk, the root causes, the approach to prioritise a remediation plan and considered the different approaches of estimating what the potential liability may be. The Committee considered and was satisfied with the judgements for the liability.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Committee received and discussed the key assumptions, operating cash flow forecasts, resulting headroom or impairment and the sensitivity analysis performed by management. They spent time understanding the balance of the plans and the uncertainty around the different judgements contained within it. The Committee considered and was satisfied with the key assumptions and agreed that a goodwill impairment charge was required in FY24 for Business.\n\n## BT Tower\n\nThe Committee considered the accounting for the sale of BT Tower, including the judgement made in concluding that control of the Tower passes to the buyer on completion of the sale and transfer of legal title, rather than on exchange of contracts in FY24.\n\n## Sports joint venture\n\nThe Committee reviewed the judgements in relation to the sports joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which has been in place for over 12 months, including assessments of the JV business performance, cash flow forecasts and the valuation of BT Group's interest in the JV.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Committee considered the assumptions and judgements underlying the valuation of the pension assets and liabilities in the financial statements, as summarised in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. It also considered the range of reasonable assumptions and the associated impacts on the balance sheet, income statement and related disclosures.\n\n## Divestments\n\nThe Committee reviewed the judgements made in relation to the group's divestments, including on whether the held for sale criteria had been satisfied, and how goodwill should be allocated to divested or held for sale entities.\n\n## Regulatory finance reporting\n\nThe Committee supported the processes and systems enhancements that were implemented to ensure that the group met its 2024 regulatory financial reporting obligations.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe Committee reviewed specific items quarterly, and considered and agreed that they were appropriately categorised. It considered management's view of the quality of earnings, definition of alternative performance measures and of the effective tax rate. It also challenged the phasing of working capital within normalised free cash flow. At each quarter, it considered a detailed assessment of provisions, and the Committee was satisfied with the analysis provided in relation to the results.",

This framework provides the tools to enable us to be smart with risk and to manage enduring risks consistently and efficiently across the group.\n\n- Further information on our risk management framework and principal risks can be found on pages 61 to 70.\n\nThe framework divides the risk landscape into areas of enduring risk called Group Risks Categories (GRCs), which cover strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks. The Board monitored the effectiveness of the group's systems of risk management and internal controls through reviews of the GRCs and consideration of reports from management, as well as from internal audit and other assurance functions. Much of this work was undertaken by this Committee on the Board's behalf. Given that the Board is ultimately responsible for the group's systems of risk management and internal controls, as Chair, I subsequently reported the key matters from each of these sessions to the Board.\n\nThe activities carried out during the year, collectively enable the Committee to confirm that the group's systems of risk management and internal control have been appropriately reviewed. Where required, targeted improvements have been planned or agreed to continue to transform our control environment and to appropriately manage risks. As part of its drive for continuous improvement, the Committee has overseen ongoing enhancements to the risk management framework. Further information on improvements being made to the overall risk management framework, as well as specific actions taken to manage our principal risks can be found on pages 61 to 62.\n\nThe Committee held discussions on the GRCs with the Executive Committe e risk owners to understand current and anticipated risk developments, and reviewed how effectively the risks are being managed. It considered the risk appetite and its supporting metrics for the GRCs, the effectiveness of the controls, mitigation activities and any areas for improvement. The Committee robustly assessed both current, specific concerns (point risks) and uncertainties that may materialise in the future (emerging risks), particularly as a consequence of adverse changes to the economic, social, regulatory, political or technology environment, or as an unintended consequence of new products and services being offered or developed by the group. The Committee agreed with management any actions required to manage or mitigate these risks effectively.\n\nIn addition, with the CFU and CU CEOs, the Committee undertook unit risk reviews of Consumer, Business and Openreach, as well as Digital and Networks, which cover how the GRCs are being managed in the respective units, and the significant point and emerging risks.\n\nAs well as the rolling programme of reviewing the GRCs and units, the Committee received updates on specific matters including supply chain and geopolitical risks in specific jurisdictions and our group-wide data programme.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nThe Committee considered regular reports on our ethics and compliance policies, and programmes and related learnings and culture. It spent time discussing anti-bribery and corruption, communications regulation compliance and the enhancement programme in relation to international trade, in line with the respective GRCs.\n\nEach quarter, the Committee received and reviewed reports on concerns raised through the Speak Up service, BT Group's confidential whistleblowing services operated by an independent company, 24 hours a day, in multiple languages, for both written and telephone reports. The Committee ensures that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of these and other matters via the ethics and relevant subject matter expert team.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nInternal audit provides independent, objective and timely assurance to senior management and the Board, through this Committee, over the design and operational effectiveness of key processes and controls that manage the risks across the organisation.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee:\n\n- - reviewed and approved the group internal audit annual plan, ensuring it aligned to the principal risks of the business\n- - reviewed the internal audit charter, which establishes internal audit's independence, authority, remit and reporting lines to conduct its work\n- - received regular reports from internal audit on its activities and progress against the group internal audit plan, allowing the Committee to monitor delivery against the plan\n- - held in-depth discussions with management on all internal audit reports where controls were assessed as 'inadequate', and action plans to address these. The actions were tracked by the Committee, including the responsiveness of management to the findings and recommendations, and the progress of closing any overdue actions.\n\nAn internal audit effectiveness review was completed during the year by the new Director of Group Internal Audit and Group Risk with support from a third party. Actions were agreed to ensure the function continues to develop. Based on this and the Committee's annual assessment of the performance and effectiveness of the function, the Committee concluded that internal audit continues to add value in the context of the group's overall assurance framework.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the reappointment of the external auditor, determining their independence from the group and its management and agreeing the scope and fee for the audit. The Committee concluded that the reappointment of KPMG should be recommended to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.\n\nFollowing the audit tender in FY17, KPMG was appointed as BT Group's external auditor from the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. The FY24 audit is KPMG's sixth audit of BT Group. Following a thorough review of potential candidates put forward by KPMG to succeed John Luke as lead audit partner, the Committee approved the appointment of Jon Mills as the KPMG lead audit partner for the BT Group with effect from the start of FY24.\n\n## During the year, the Committee:\n\n- - considered and approved the proposed external audit fees for the year ended 31 March 2024, including one-off fees, as well as the recurring audit fee for the regulatory financial statements and the interim review fee (see the Independent auditor's report on pages 132 to 143 for more details)\n- - reviewed with the external auditor, the external auditor's scope of work, audit plan and strategy for FY24\n- - approved the engagement letter of the external auditor\n- - recommended approval by the Board of management's letters of representation.",

        "page_content": "As part of my year-end report to the Board, I informed the Board of the outcome of the external audit.\n\nBT Group confirms that it complies with the EU Regulation on Audit Reform and the Competition and Markets Authority's Statutory Audit Services Order with regard to mandatory auditor rotation and tendering.\n\n## Independence and non-audit services\n\nThe Committee discussed the external auditor's independence and potential areas that could give rise to a conflict of interest, and considered the safeguards in place to prevent compromising their independence and objectivity. In particular, the Committee considered BT's provision of network and mobile services to KPMG UK, including KPMG's assessment and conclusion of independence. The Committee considered this and confirmed its agreement that the provision of these services to KPMG is not material from an independence perspective.\n\nBT Group's non-audit services policy sets out the non-audit services that can be provided by the external auditor, in line with the latest ethical standards. The external auditor is not permitted to perform any work which they may later be required to audit, or which might affect their objectivity and independence, or create a conflict of interest. Internal procedures describe the approval process for work performed by the external auditor, and these applied to KPMG throughout the year. The Committee monitored compliance with the policies and procedures and considered business relationships with the external auditor, and the level and appropriateness of non-audit services and fees. The Committee will continue to keep under review BT Group's non-audit services policy.\n\n## Our non-audit services policy can be found at bt.com/ governance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the confirmation and information received from the external auditor on the arrangements that it has in place to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, which are consistent with the ethical standards published by the FRC, including specific safeguards where they provide permissible nonaudit services to the group. The nature of the non-audit services carried out by the external auditor during the year are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page 161. These were required by law or regulation to be carried out by an appointed auditor and services that support us to fulfil obligations required by law or regulation, contractual requirements, or represented areas of assurance work where it was materially more efficient for the external auditor to be engaged, as opposed to another third party due to the work completed in relation to the audit, and which were permitted to be performed by an auditor under the Revised Ethical Standard 2019.\n\nAudit-related assurance services, as well as any approved nonaudit services performed by KPMG, are considered a low threat to auditor independence. Non-audit services are predominantly made up of audit-related assurance services, such as the audit of the regulatory financial statements, the interim review and providing comfort letters for bond issuances. This work falls within the scope of limited permissible services, which are closely related to existing audit work that KPMG provides. Therefore the proportion of 'other non-audit services' to 'total services' carried out by the external auditor is considered the most suitable measure of the non-audit services provided. These represented 0.1% of the total fees (FY23: 0.2%).\n\n## External auditor effectiveness and quality\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit process and the qualifications, expertise, resources, independence and objectivity of the external auditor, including the nature and extent of non-audit services throughout the year, focusing on:\n\n- - the quality of the audit and the financial reporting process, including how effective the external auditor is at identifying and addressing matters that could compromise the quality of BT Group's reporting\n- - the service of the external auditor and the relationships with the Committee, key members of management and the internal auditor\n- - whether the external auditor has demonstrated professional scepticism\n- - whether the external auditor has challenged management's assumptions where necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Review process\n\nThe Committee reviewed the audit scope and plan at the start of the year, and received regular audit reports from the external auditor. This enabled the Committee to assess the quality of audit work. The Committee had the opportunity to interact with the external auditor at meetings as well as to observe the communication and interactions between the external auditor with management and the internal auditor. The Committee reviewed and monitored management's responsiveness to the external auditor's requests for information and its findings and recommendations. The Committee Chair also regularly met with the lead audit partner.\n\nDuring the year, a questionnaire was also completed by the Committee members and management to gather their perspectives on the effectiveness and quality of the external auditor's work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee agreed that:\n\n- - the audit contributed to the integrity of the group's financial reporting\n- - the relationship between KPMG and both the Committee and management continues to be effective\n- - KPMG demonstrated an appropriate degree of professional scepticism and deployed a team with the required level of skill and expertise to enable an effective audit\n- - the audit strategy and plan was appropriately scoped, communicated and executed\n- - KPMG continues to be independent, and recommended to the Board that the reappointment of KPMG, as our external auditor, be put to our shareholders for approval at the 2024 AGM (this was subsequently approved by the Board).",

        "page_content": "Report on directors' remuneration\n\ncontinued\n\nOn behalf of the Committee I'd like to start by thanking Sir Ian Cheshire, the former Committee Chair, for a smooth handover and for securing shareholder support for our Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM). I intend to continue the work of the Committee by supporting our new Chief Executive and the executive team in realising the group's long term strategic goals.\n\nThis report sets out information on the Committee's activities during the year, our remuneration framework and its implementation.  I've also provided further context on the performance of the business throughout the year and the environment in which the Committee made decisions on executive pay.\n\n## Stakeholder context\n\n## Wider workforce pay and conditions\n\nAs reported last year, we accelerated part of our 2023 pay review and delivered a \u00a31,500 pay rise in January 2023 to support 85% of our UK colleagues (all of those earning a \u00a350,000 full-time equivalent salary or below) during the cost-of-living crisis. This cohort received a further salary increase of at least 2.5% in September 2023, while a 5.5% budget was set for all other colleagues who had received no increase in January. Combined, therefore, all UK colleagues received at least 5.5% in 2023, with our frontline colleagues receiving up to 10% and an average of 7.2%.\n\nFurther, as part of the September pay review, we also secured agreement with our unions for the 2024 review, bringing welcome certainty to both colleagues and the business. All UK frontline colleagues received a 4% increase in April 2024, while a 4% budget was available for our UK management population in June 2024.\n\nAlthough inflation has fallen in recent months, the Committee understands that our colleagues continue to face cost pressures and it receives regular updates on pay and conditions across the business throughout the year. Isabel Hudson, as the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, fed back any comments and sentiments on remuneration matters raised by the Colleague Board during the year. Maggie Chan Jones took on this responsibility during the year and the Committee will consult with Maggie to ensure these issues continue to be front-of-mind as it makes decisions on executive pay.\n\nIn 2022 we voluntarily committed to paying all our UK colleagues at least in line with the Real Living Wage and continue to do so. This year, we expanded our commitment to pay a fair living wage to direct employees in all countries in which we operate, in compliance with the Ethical Trading Initiative's Base Code #5.1. We're confident that we meet minimum wage requirements in all countries in which we operate.  Almost 85% of our management colleagues are currently paid within or above their competitive market range, and we'll continue to focus on improving competitive pay positioning as part of our annual pay cycle.\n\n## Customer context\n\nWe accentuated our focus this year on our customers during challenging economic times, and achieved particularly strong NPS results in our Business and Openreach divisions. Customer experience remains a core pillar of our strategy, and a key part of our annual bonus scorecard for the coming financial year.\n\n## Shareholder context\n\nOur share price performance over FY24 reflects the continued volatility in the wider market as well as the scale of the long term investment that we're undertaking. However, we remain confident in our longer term strategy and continue to deliver against it. We again paid dividends in FY24 and believe that we've appointed the right Chief Executive to realise our vision for BT Group, bringing longer term benefits for our shareholders.\n\n## Salary\n\n## 2023 salary review\n\nAs outlined above, our annual salary review for senior management took place in September rather than June. Simon Lowth received a base salary increase of 5.5% in line with the minimum increase for UK senior management colleagues. As disclosed previously, Philip Jansen waived his right to any increase in his base salary which had been fixed for five years following his appointment.\n\n## 2024 salary review\n\nThis year the annual salary review moves back to its usual effective date in June. UK managers are receiving an average 4% increase in salary, with an expected 2% minimum increase granted across the vast majority of our UK management population. There has been a particular focus on data-driven decision making, to target higher increases on those whose pay is less competitive versus market comparators. In line with this approach, Simon will receive a 2% increase in base salary.\n\nAllison Kirkby's salary was set at \u00a31,100,000 on appointment in February. No annual salary increase was awarded for 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Report on directors' remuneration continued\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## FY24 annual bonus outcomes\n\nFor FY24, annual bonus performance was based on a scorecard of five key financial and non-financial measures that align to our strategic priorities. Financial performance accounted for 70% of the bonus scorecard and comprised the following measures:\n\n- -Adjusted EBITDA (35%) - despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we exceeded our target for the year and delivered \u00a38.1bn in EBITDA.\n- -Normalised free cash flow (35%) - management of free cash flow was strong in-year, and we delivered  NFCF of \u00a31.28bn, above target and our guidance for the year.\n\nOur non-financial measures accounted for 30% of the bonus scorecard and comprised the following measures:\n\n- -Customer (20%) - this year saw increased NPS scores, particularly in Business and Openreach. After a disappointing previous year, we made up ground during FY24 in a difficult environment, exceeding target in three of four quarters, and stretch in two of four. Across the full year, performance was between target and stretch.\n- - Inclusion, equity and diversity (10%):\n- -Representation in senior management team (5%) - we've set ambitious and stretching diverse representation targets across BT Group, and this metric measures progress towards meeting them. Although we made significant progress in disability representation, and some improvement in representation of black and black heritage colleagues, we failed to meet our targets on gender. Overall, therefore, the outcome was between threshold and target for the year.\n- -Inclusion index (5%) - defined as the average score across four key inclusion questions in our employee engagement surveys, this measure aimed to close the gap in inclusion sentiment for key under-represented groups. Unfortunately, the average gap in inclusion index score across these four groups increased from 4.6% to 5.9%, which did not meet our threshold target.\n\nMore information on the actions we are taking on inclusion, equity and diversity can be found on pages 31 to 32. Further detail on the FY24 annual bonus scorecard outcomes can be found on page 114.\n\nThe overall formulaic outcome of the bonus scorecard was 129.2% of target. The Committee considered this result in the context of the wider performance of the business, the pace of our transformation to date, and the experience of our shareholders, and exercised its discretion to reduce the bonus payout to 110% of target.\n\nPhilip and Simon will therefore be awarded bonuses of \u00a31,452,000 and \u00a31,044,655 respectively. Half of Simon's bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## FY25 annual bonus scorecard\n\nThe Committee has agreed that the current bonus scorecard remains aligned with our strategic priorities for the year, and accordingly no changes are proposed to the measures and weightings, other than minor tweaks in how inclusion and diversity are measured to ensure they remain fit for purpose.\n\nThe annual bonus plan remains subject to a health and safety underpin and, if triggered, the Committee retains the discretion to reduce the payout as it considers appropriate, including to nil.\n\nNo changes are proposed to bonus opportunities: on-target and maximum will remain at 120% and 200% of salary for both Allison and Simon, with 50% deferred into shares for a period of three years.\n\n## Long term incentives\n\n## Vesting of 2021 Restricted Share Plan awards\n\nThe Committee carried out an assessment of the two underpins applying to the 2021 Restricted Share Plan (RSP) awards (relating to ROCE performance and ESG/reputational damage) and determined that neither were triggered.\n\nThe Committee also assessed whether there was any evidence of windfall gains at the point of grant or vesting of these awards and concluded there was not. The Committee therefore agreed that the expected vesting value is appropriate.\n\nAll three tranches of the 2021 RSP awards will therefore vest in full in June 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively. Tranches one and two remain subject to a holding requirement until June 2026.\n\n## Grant of 2023 RSP awards\n\nThe grant of our 2023 RSP awards was delayed from June until September in line with the annual salary review. Simon received an award at the normal Policy opportunity of 200% of salary, whilst Philip did not receive an award in light of him stepping down from the Board. Allison received an award upon appointment in February, granted at the normal opportunity and pro-rated to reflect that she joined part-way through the vesting period. All awards will be subject to both ROCE and sustainability underpins, details of which can be found on page 115.\n\nThe Committee considered the level of awards, mindful that the share price at the time of award was lower than at the time of the 2022 RSP award.\n\nAs set out elsewhere in this report, the group is undergoing significant change as the Board-approved plan to transform and grow the business is executed. In order to build the UK's leading networks and deliver for our customers, significant and ongoing long term investment is required. The Committee considers that the current share price reflects the position of the group in this strategic journey and that future share price increases will be as a result of management taking the right actions and consistently executing our strategy over the next three to five years, rather than as a result of a more general market recovery or windfall gain. The Committee therefore decided not to make any adjustment to the award level, but to review the value of the 2023 RSP awards at the time of vesting and use its discretion to adjust the outcome at that point, should it deem this to be appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Grant of 2024 RSP awards\n\nBoth Allison and Simon will be granted an award of 200% of salary in June. As in prior years, these awards will vest in three equal tranches in June 2027, 2028 and 2029, with all tranches subject to a holding requirement until June 2029.\n\nRSP awards will be subject to the same two underpins as the 2023 awards, measured over the initial three-year vesting period:\n\n- 1. ROCE average return on capital employed must be at least 7% a .\n- 2. Sustainability the business must have made sufficient progress over the vesting period towards meeting our sustainability commitments (this could include carbon emissions, carbon abatement and circularity).\n\n## Executive Director changes\n\n## Departure of Philip Jansen\n\nLast July we announced Philip's intention to step down from the Board once a suitable successor had been identified. He stepped down as Chief Executive on 31 January 2024, and remains an employee of the group until 30 June 2024 during which time he will make himself available to Allison Kirkby on request to ensure an orderly and effective handover. He will continue to receive his contractual salary and benefits until this date.\n\nIn line with the Policy and the treatment of prior leavers, and in light of the fact that he has retired from executive life, the Committee elected to treat Philip as a good leaver. As a result, he will be eligible to receive a full-year bonus in respect of FY24, which will be paid in full in June 2024.  Given his retirement, no deferral will apply, with the full bonus paid in June 2024.\n\nPhilip did not receive an RSP award in September 2023 as he had already announced his decision to step down. Outstanding shares under the RSP will be preserved, pro-rated for service, and will vest according to their normal schedule (subject to satisfaction of the relevant underpins). Outstanding shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) will be retained fully and vest according to their usual timeframe.\n\nPhilip will also be required to maintain a minimum shareholding equivalent to 500% of his annual salary for two years post cessation of employment.\n\n## Appointment of Allison Kirkby\n\nAllison transitioned from her role as a Non-Executive Director to Chief Executive on 1 February 2024. Allison will receive the same remuneration package as her predecessor, which is within the parameters of the Policy and aligned to the market for comparators of BT Group's size and complexity.\n\nThis includes an annual salary of \u00a31,100,000, and on-target bonus opportunity of 120% of salary, with 50% of any bonus deferred into shares for a three-year period. Allison will also receive an annual RSP grant worth 200% of salary, and an award in respect of FY24 was granted in February pro-rated to reflect that she joined part-way through the vesting period. Subject to the satisfaction of the relevant underpins, the RSP awards will vest in three tranches after three to five years and be subject to a holding period until year five.\n\nFull details of Allison's remuneration package can be found in the section outlining the planned implementation of the Policy for FY25 on page 112.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Director (NED) fees\n\nIn line with the wider workforce increase and that offered to Simon, the NED base fee will increase from 1 June by 2%, the first increase in two years. For simplicity, the fee payable for membership of the Nominations Committee (which all NEDs receive) has been consolidated into the base fee. As Chairman, Adam Crozier waived his right to receive any increase.\n\nNoting the changes to the structure and responsibility of our Board Committees that have been made this year, a full review of our Committee and additional responsibility fees was undertaken, to ensure they remain appropriate and market-competitive. These fees have not been increased since 2019, and accordingly the following was agreed:\n\n- - An increase from \u00a314,000 to \u00a325,000 for the Chair of the Responsible Business Committee , and an increase from \u00a38,000 to \u00a315,000 for members of said Committee\n- - An increase from \u00a310,000 to \u00a317,000 for the Designated NonExecutive Director for Workforce Engagement.\n\nAs always, the Committee and I wish to maintain an open dialogue on remuneration matters with our investors and I would welcome their comments or feedback, and support, at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Ruth Cairnie\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 15 May 2024",

Allison will not receive a bonus in respect of FY24. Philip's FY24 bonus will be paid fully in cash, with no deferral into shares.\n- d Value shown represents the estimated value of the second tranche of the RSP awards granted in 2020 and the first tranche of the RSP awards granted in 2021, that will vest in August and June 2024 respectively. The estimated value is based on a three-month average share price from 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2024 of 110.46p. Further details are provided on page 118. For the 2021 award, none of the value was attributable to share price appreciation over the vesting period. The Committee did not exercise any discretion in relation to the vesting of the awards or share price change.\n- e The first tranche of the 2020 RSP vested in August 2023. The 2020 RSP value reported last year (\u00a3803,000 for Philip and \u00a3537,000 for Simon) was calculated on an estimated basis using the three-month average share price from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 of 135.88p.

A 5.5% increase to Simon Lowth's salary was agreed from 1 September 2023 in line with increases for our UK senior management team, bringing Simon's salary to \u00a3791,405. Philip's salary of \u00a31,100,000 was fixed for five years at the time of his appointment in January 2019.  Allison was appointed as Chief Executive on 1 January 2024 and the Committee agreed a salary of \u00a31,100,000.\n\nAdam's annual fee has been \u00a3700,000 since his appointment as Chairman on 1 December 2021. His fee has remained at this level throughout the year as the Chairman volunteered to waive any fee increase during FY24.\n\nThe fees for Non-Executive Directors reflect Committee-related or other additional responsibilities, including on a pro-rated basis for any appointments during the year. A full breakdown of Non-Executive Director fees is set out on page 119.\n\n## Pension allowance\n\nExecutive Directors receive an annual cash allowance, which can be put towards the provision of retirement benefits.\n\nAll Executive Directors received an annual allowance of 10% of salary. This is aligned with the contribution rate available to the majority of our UK employees. We also provide death in service cover consisting of a lump sum equal to four times salary, and for Simon Lowth only, a dependants' pension equal to 30% of his capped salary.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nPhilip and Simon were eligible for an on-target bonus in respect of FY24 of 120% of salary with a maximum opportunity of 200% of salary. Having joined as Chief Executive on 1 February 2024 and in accordance with the bonus plan rules, Allison was not entitled to a bonus for FY24.  The annual bonus is based on performance against a scorecard of five key financial and non-financial measures linked to our KPIs as set out on pages 48 to 49.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Category                  | Measure                        | Weighting   | Threshold   | Target   | Stretch   | Actual   | Payout (% of max)   |     |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|-----|\n| Financial                 | Adjusted EBITDA (\u00a3m)           | 35%         | 7,959       | 8,075    | 8,191     | 8,100    |                     | 80% |\n| Financial                 | Normalised free cash flow (\u00a3m) | 35%         | 1,072       | 1,188    | 1,304     | 1,280    |                     | 92% |\n| Transformation  scorecard | Group NPS                      | 20%         | 0           | 100      | 200       | 132      |                     | 73% |\n| Transformation  scorecard | SMT representation (%)         | 5%          | 76.9        | 84.6     | 92.3      | 82.8     |                     | 53% |\n| Transformation  scorecard | Inclusion index                | 5%          | 3.5%        | 2.3%     | 1.1%      | 6.0%     |                     | 0%  |\n\nFor scorecard purposes, the EBITDA result assumes an on-target bonus payout for all colleagues. Actual post-bonus EBITDA for FY24 is \u00a38,100m.\n\nWhen determining the overall performance and bonus pay-outs, the Committee also considers a number of other factors including the wider performance of the business, share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. Despite the formulaic outcome of the final bonus scorecard being 129.2% of target, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the outcome to 110% of target. The Committee believes this is a fair reflection of the overall performance of the business.\n\nThe final bonus outturns for Philip and Simon are set out in the table below:\n\n|               | Formulaic outcome   | Following discretion   | % of max   | Value      |\n|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 129.2% of target    | 110% of target         | 65.9%      | \u00a31,452,000 |\n| Simon Lowth   | 129.2% of target    | 110% of target         | 65.9%      | \u00a31,044,655 |\n\n## 2021 RSP\n\nThe RSP is a conditional share award. Two underpins applied over the initial three-year vesting period:\n\n- - ROCE is equal to or exceeds the WACC over the same period\n- - there must have been no ESG issues which have resulted in material reputational damage for the group.\n\nThe Committee assessed performance against the two underpins at the end of the financial year and agreed that both had been satisfied.\n\nAs a result, all three tranches of the 2021 RSP award will vest in full in June 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively. Tranches one and two remain subject to a holding requirement until June 2026.",

An RSP award was made to Simon Lowth in line with the normal Policy level. Despite serving as Chief Executive for almost a year of the performance period, no award was made to Philip Jansen on the basis of him stepping down as Chief Executive at the end of January 2024.\n\nTo reflect her joining part-way through the initial three-year vesting period, a pro-rated award was made to Allison Kirkby.\n\n| Director       | Date of award    | RSP award  (shares)   | Grant price a   |   % of salary | Face value  of award   |\n|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| Allison Kirkby | 8 February 2024  | 1,484,942             | 107.00p         |           144 | \u00a31,588,889             |\n| Simon Lowth    | 7 September 2023 | 1,388,429             | 114.00p         |           200 | \u00a31,582,809             |\n\nShould one or both underpins not be met, the Committee may at its discretion reduce the number of shares vesting, including to nil.\n\nAwards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, with an additional holding period such that no shares may be sold until year five.

Allison will receive the same remuneration package as her predecessor, which is within the parameters of the Policy and aligned to the market for comparators of BT Group's size and complexity.\n\nThis includes an annual salary of \u00a31,100,000, and on-target bonus opportunity of 120% of salary, with 50% of any bonus deferred into shares for a three-years. Allison was not eligible to receive a bonus in respect of FY24. Allison's RSP opportunity under the Policy will be 200% of salary. As outlined above, Allison was granted an RSP award in respect of FY24 in February 2024 pro-rated to reflect that she joined part-way through the initial three-year vesting period. Subject to the satisfaction of relevant underpins, RSP awards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years and be subject to a further two-year holding period.\n\nAllison will be subject to our shareholding requirement, being expected to build up a shareholding of 500% of salary within five years of the date of her appointment.  This requirement continues to apply for two years post-cessation.",

Under the terms of his service contract, he will continue to receive his salary and contractual benefits until the end of his notice period, being 30 June 2024. These payments will total \u00a3458,333 basic salary and fees, \u00a38,888 benefits and \u00a345,883 pension allowance. For FY24 this amounts to \u00a3183,333 basic salary and fees, \u00a33,555 benefits and \u00a318,333 pension allowance. For FY25 this amounts to \u00a3275,000 basic salary and fees, \u00a35,333 benefits and \u00a327,500 pension allowance. Philip will receive no compensation or payment for the termination of his service contract or his ceasing to be a director of BT Group or any other group company, although BT Group will pay independent adviser fees of \u00a345,000 (paid directly to the adviser) and \u00a3100 for reconfirmation of customary post-employment restrictions on working for competitors.\n\nIn line with the Policy and the treatment of prior leavers, and in light of the fact that he has retired from executive life, the Committee elected to treat Philip as a good leaver. As a result, he will be eligible to receive a full-year bonus in respect of FY24, which will be paid in full in June 2024. Philip will not be eligible for an annual bonus in FY25.\n\nPhilip did not receive an RSP award in September 2023 as he had already announced his decision to step down. Outstanding shares under the RSP will be preserved, pro-rated for service, and will vest according to their normal schedule (subject to satisfaction of the relevant underpins). Outstanding shares under the DBP will be retained fully and vest according to their usual timeframe.\n\nPhilip will also be required to maintain a minimum shareholding equivalent to 500% of his annual salary for two years post cessation of employment.\n\n## Former directors (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to former directors during the year.\n\n## Directors' share ownership (audited)\n\nThe Committee believes that the interests of the Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The aim is to encourage the build-up of a meaningful shareholding in BT Group plc over time by retaining net shares received through the executive share plans or from market purchases.\n\nThe shareholding requirement for Executive Directors under the Policy is 500% of salary. Executive Directors are expected to meet this requirement within five years of the approval of the Policy or, in the case of any new Executive Directors appointed, within five years of their date of appointment.\n\nThe shareholding requirement continues to apply in full for two years post-cessation of employment (or the total number of shares held at cessation, if lower). The post-cessation shareholding requirement will be calculated and expressed as a fixed number of shares by reference to the closing BT Group plc share price on the day immediately prior to the cessation date. The requirement is fixed as this number of shares for a period of two years and compliance will be measured at cessation and annually thereafter. In enforcing continued compliance post-cessation, the Committee may request that the Executive Director transfers any shares subject to the shareholding requirement to be held in trust until they no longer need to be retained.\n\nWe encourage the Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis, BT Group plc shares with an aggregate value of \u00a35,000 on average each year (based on acquisition price) to further align the interests of Non-Executive Directors with those of our shareholders. They are asked to hold these shares until they cease being a member of the Board.\n\nThis does not apply to the Deutsche Telekom nominated representative director appointed to the Board as a Non-Independent, NonExecutive Director under the terms of the EE acquisition in January 2016. This helps avoid any conflict of interest.",

The numbers represent the maximum possible vesting levels. Full details of all DBP and RSP awards, including restricted periods and vesting conditions, are set out on page 118.\n\nFor Executive Directors we use the average BT Group plc share price over the preceding 12 months (or the share price at acquisition/ vesting date if higher) to determine whether the minimum shareholding requirement has been reached.\n\nDuring the period 1 April 2024 to 15 May 2024, there were no movements in directors' beneficial holdings or other interests in shares. The directors, as a group, beneficially own less than 1% of BT Group plc's shares.\n\n| Executive Directors   | Number of shares  owned outright at  31 March 2024   | RSP and  DBP a   | Options b   | Shareholding  requirement  (% of salary)   | Current  shareholding  (% of salary)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Allison Kirkby        | 525,000                                              | 787,019          | 0           | 500%                                       | 161%                                   |\n| Simon Lowth           | 1,186,387                                            | 2,695,526        | 11,222      | 500%                                       | 728%                                   |\n\n- a Subject to continued employment and, for the RSP, two underpins over the initial three-year vesting period.\n- b Includes interests in saveshare, a HMRC-approved all-employee plan and yourshare, a HMRC-approved share incentive plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                    | Beneficial holding owned  outright at 1 April 2023   | Beneficial holding owned  outright at 31 March 2024   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chairman                           |                                                      |                                                       |\n| Adam Crozier                       | 62,500                                               | 62,500                                                |\n| Non-Executive Directors            |                                                      |                                                       |\n| Ruth Cairnie a                     | n/a                                                  | 25,000                                                |\n| Maggie Chan Jones                  | 0                                                    | 70,000                                                |\n| Steven Guggenheimer                | 0                                                    | 4,700                                                 |\n| Isabel Hudson                      | 24,090                                               | 24,090                                                |\n| Matthew Key                        | 161,686                                              | 209,586                                               |\n| Raphael K\u00fcbler b                   | 0                                                    | 0                                                     |\n| Sara Weller                        | 37,000                                               | 47,000                                                |\n| Directors who left during the year |                                                      |                                                       |\n| Philip Jansen c                    | 6,412,792                                            | 7,366,259                                             |\n| Adel Al-Saleh d                    | 0                                                    | 0                                                     |\n| Ian Cheshire e                     | 19,646                                               | 19,646                                                |\n| Iain Conn e                        | 69,442                                               | 69,442                                                |\n| Total                              | 6,787,156                                            | 7,898,223                                             |\n\n- a Ruth was appointed as a Director on 6 April 2023.\n- b Raphael was appointed as a Director on 30 January 2024.\n- c Philip stepped down as a Director and Chief Executive on 31 January 2024 and the number reflects his holding at that date.\n- d Adel stepped down as a Director on 31 December 2023 and the number reflects his holding at that date.\n- e Ian and Iain stepped down as Directors at the conclusion of the AGM on 13 July 2023 and the number reflects their holding at that date.",

No salary increase will be awarded for 2024.\n\nIn line with an expected minimum increase granted across our UK management population, Simon will receive a 2% salary increase effective 1 June 2024.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFor Executive Directors, the Committee has set benefits in line with the Policy. No changes are proposed to the benefit framework for FY25.\n\n## Pension allowance\n\nIn line with the rate offered to the majority of our UK workforce, both Executive Directors receive an annual allowance equal to 10% of salary in lieu of pension provision.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nBoth Executive Directors are eligible for an on-target and maximum bonus opportunity of 120% and 200% of salary respectively. In line with the Policy, 50% of any bonus payable will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed in full the measures, weightings and targets used in the annual bonus scorecard. The FY25 annual bonus structure measures and weightings are set out below.\n\n| Category       | Measure                   | Weighting                 |\n|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                | 35%                       | Financial Adjusted EBITDA |\n|                | Normalised free cash flow | 35%                       |\n| Transformation | 20%                       | NPS                       |\n| scorecard      | Inclusion & diversity     | 10%                       |\n\nAll of the annual bonus measures are linked to our KPIs as set out on pages 48 to 49.\n\nIn addition to the annual bonus scorecard, a health and safety underpin applies which allows the Committee to exercise its discretion to reduce the annual bonus payout result if there is a significant breach in health and safety.\n\nWe do not publish details of the targets in advance as these are commercially confidential. Targets will be disclosed in full in the 2025 Report on directors' remuneration.\n\n## RSP\n\nBoth Executive Directors will be granted an award under the RSP in June 2024 to the value of 200% of salary.\n\nWhen considering the grant levels each year, the Committee takes in account of the share price performance over the preceding year. Following review, the Committee has agreed that awards will be granted to both Executive Directors this year at the normal Policy level of 200% of salary.\n\nThe Committee has agreed the same two underpins will apply for the 2024 RSP awards which will be measured over the initial threeyear vesting period:\n\n- - Average ROCE must be at least 7% 1\n- - The business must have made sufficient progress over the vesting period towards meeting our sustainability commitments (which could include carbon emissions, carbon abatement and circularity).\n\nAwards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, with an additional holding period such that no shares may be sold until year five. At vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions and overarching Committee discretion applies, as set out in the Policy.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe fees for Non-Executive Directors were reviewed in the year by the Chairman and Executive Directors, taking into consideration the role and requirements of BT Group, together with the fees paid to non-executive directors at companies of a similar size and complexity. Following the review it was agreed to increase the base fee by 2% in line with the minimum expected budget for our UK management colleagues. It was also agreed to consolidate the Nominations Committee member's fee (\u00a310,000) into the base fee. This means the base fee will increase from \u00a378,540 to \u00a390,000 a year effective from 1 June 2024.\n\nThe Chairman receives a single all-inclusive fee for his role. No increase has been awarded for FY25 and this will remain at \u00a3700,000.\n\nOther changes agreed as part of the review were:\n\n- - An increase in the Responsible Business Committee chair's fee from \u00a314,000 to \u00a325,000\n- - An increase in the Responsible Business Committee member's fee from \u00a38,000 to \u00a315,000\n- - An increase in the fee for the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement from \u00a310,000 to \u00a317,000.\n\nThe table below sets out the additional fees for membership and chairing a Board Committee and reflects the changes agreed during the year.\n\n| Committee                                 | Chair's fee   | Member's fee   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Audit & Risk                              | \u00a335,000       | \u00a325,000        |\n| National Security &  Investigatory Powers | n/a a         | \u00a38,000         |\n| Remuneration                              | \u00a330,000       | \u00a315,000        |\n| Responsible Business                      | \u00a325,000       | \u00a315,000        |\n\n## Other fees payable include:\n\n- - an additional fee of \u00a327,000 per annum to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director\n- - an additional fee of \u00a320,000 per annum to the Director appointed to the joint venture between BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNo element of Non-Executive Director remuneration is performance-related. Neither the Chairman nor the NonExecutive Directors participate in our bonus or employee share plans and nor are they members of any of the group pension schemes.",

        "page_content": "## Annual remuneration report continued\n\n## Other remuneration matters\n\n## Advisers\n\nDuring the year, the Committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte has been objective and independent. The Deloitte partner who provides remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any connections with BT Group plc that may impact their independence. Deloitte received \u00a375,800 (excluding VAT) in fees for these services.\n\nThe fees are charged on a time-spent basis in delivering advice. That advice materially assisted the Committee in its consideration of matters relating to executive remuneration and the Policy.\n\nDeloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nIn addition, during FY24, Deloitte provided the group with advice on corporate and indirect taxes, assistance with regulatory, risk and compliance issues, accounting advice, and additional consultancy services.\n\n## Dilution\n\nWe use both treasury shares and shares purchased by the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to satisfy our all-employee share plans and executive share plans. Shares held in the Trust do not have any voting rights.\n\nAs at 31 March 2024, shares equivalent to 2.31% (FY23: 3.03%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be required to satisfy all outstanding share options and awards. Of these, we estimate that for FY25, shares equivalent to approximately 0.27% (FY23: 0.87%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) will be required to satisfy the allemployee share plans.\n\n## Previous AGM voting outcomes\n\nThe table below sets out the previous votes cast at the AGM in respect of the Annual remuneration report and the Policy.\n\n|                                                     | For % of votes cast/ Number   | Against % of votes cast/ Number   | Withheld votes/ Number   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Report on  directors'  remuneration  at the 13 July | 98.15                         | 1.85                              |                          |\n| 2023 AGM                                            | 6,801,425,259                 | 128,049,792                       | 1,580,860                |\n| Policy at the  13 July 2023                         | 98.17                         | 1.83                              |                          |\n| AGM                                                 | 6,798,003,577                 | 126,721,663                       | 6,331,473                |\n\nWithheld votes are not counted when calculating voting outcomes.\n\n## Committee evaluation FY24\n\nDetails on the FY24 Board and Committee evaluation can be found on page 94.\n\n## Comparison of Chief Executive remuneration to TSR (unaudited)\n\nTSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. The graph below illustrates the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR relative to a broad equity market index over the past ten years. We consider the FTSE 100 to be the most appropriate index against which to measure performance, as BT Group plc has been a member of the FTSE 100 throughout the ten-year period.\n\n## BT Group plc's TSR performance vs the FTSE 100\n\nSource: Datastream\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## History of Chief Executive remuneration\n\nvesting\n\n| Year end   | Chief Executive   | Total  remuneration  \u00a3000   | Annual bonus  (% of max)   | ISP/RSP  (% of max)   |\n|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2024       | Allison Kirkby a  | 341                         | n/a                        | n/a                   |\n|            | Philip Jansen b   | 3,719                       | 65.9%                      | 100%                  |\n| 2023       | Philip Jansen     | 3,089                       | 43.7%                      | 100%                  |\n| 2022       | Philip Jansen     | 3,460                       | 60%                        | 19.1%                 |\n| 2021       | Philip Jansen     | 2,628                       | 60%                        | 0%                    |\n| 2020       | Philip Jansen     | 3,248                       | 50%                        | n/a                   |\n| 2019       | Philip Jansen     | 725                         | 56%                        | n/a                   |\n|            | Gavin Patterson c | 1,719                       | 28%                        | 0%                    |\n| 2018       | Gavin Patterson   | 2,307                       | 54%                        | 0%                    |\n| 2017       | Gavin Patterson   | 1,345                       | 0%                         | 0%                    |\n| 2016       | Gavin Patterson   | 5,396                       | 45%                        | 82.0%                 |\n| 2015       | Gavin Patterson   | 4,562                       | 58%                        | 67.4%                 |\n\n- a Allison was appointed as a Director on 15 March 2019 and became Chief Executive from 1 February 2024.

and Deutsche Telekom. The  appointment is terminable immediately by either party. |\n\nAs announced on 7 May 2024, Tushar Morzaria joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director with immediate effect.  In addition, Isabel Hudson will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on 11 July 2024.\n\nThere are no other service agreements, letters of appointment or material contracts, existing or proposed, between BT Group plc and any of the directors. There are no arrangements or understandings between any director or executive officer and any other person pursuant to which any director or executive officer was selected to serve. There are no family relationships between the directors.\n\n## Independent Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nEach Independent Non-Executive Director has an appointment letter setting out the terms of his or her appointment. We ask each NonExecutive Director to allow a minimum commitment of 22 days each year, subject to Committee responsibilities, and to allow slightly more in the first year in order to take part in the induction programme. The actual time commitment required in any year may vary depending on business and additional time may be required during periods of increased activity.\n\nThe service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at BT Group plc's registered office.",

There are several general reward principles which we apply at all levels:\n\n- - We'll provide a competitive package with reference to the relevant market for each colleague\n- - We'll ensure colleagues can share in the success of the business, and through the operation of all-employee share plans encourage colleagues to become shareholders\n- - Where appropriate, variable remuneration is provided to incentivise employees towards driving the strategic aims of the business. Performance is based on both individual performance and the performance of the group, using a consistent framework for our senior management team and the majority of other colleagues\n- - We offer a range of employee benefits, many of which are available to all colleagues\n- - We aim for transparency and a fair cascade of remuneration throughout the group\n- - Employment conditions for all colleagues reflect our values and are commensurate with those of a large publicly listed company, including high standards of health and safety, and a strong commitment to inclusion, diversity and wellbeing.\n\nThe Committee supports fairness and transparency of remuneration arrangements and the Policy has been designed to align with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across the wider group. To support this, the Committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations.\n\nWhilst the Committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining executive pay, the Board does receive feedback from employee surveys that take into account remuneration throughout the organisation. The Designated NonExecutive Director for Workforce Engagement also updates the Committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions.\n\nWhen setting Executive Directors' remuneration, the Committee considers the remuneration of other senior managers and colleagues in the group more generally to ensure that arrangements for Executive Directors are appropriate in this context. When determining salary increases for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the group.\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe table below sets out the Chief Executive pay ratios as at 31 March 2024, as well as those reported in respect of the prior five years. This report will build up over time to show a rolling ten-year period.\n\nThe ratios compare the single total figure of remuneration of the Chief Executive with the equivalent figures for the UK lower quartile (P25), median (P50) and upper quartile (P75) employees.\n\nA significant proportion of the Chief Executive's remuneration is delivered through long term incentives, where awards are linked to share price movements over the longer term. This means that the ratios will depend significantly on long term incentive outcomes and may fluctuate from year to year, for example, the highest ratio was exhibited in 2024 due to an above-target bonus payout, and the vesting of two separate tranches of RSP awards to Philip Jansen. We believe that these ratios are appropriate given the size and complexity of the business, and are a fair reflection of our remuneration principles and practices.\n\nWe have used the 'Option B' methodology (based on gender pay reporting), as the most robust way to identify the individual reference points within an organisation with multiple operating segments.\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief Executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a32,444,000      | \u00a334,281                 | \u00a341,477                 | \u00a351,594                 | 71:1        | 59:1        | 47:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a33,248,000      | \u00a334,881                 | \u00a342,173                 | \u00a351,351                 | 93:1        | 77:1        | 63:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a32,628,000      | \u00a335,569                 | \u00a341,600                 | \u00a350,391                 | 74:1        | 63:1        | 52:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a33,350,000      | \u00a335,722                 | \u00a340,059                 | \u00a349,488                 | 94:1        | 84:1        | 68:1        |\n| 2023 | \u00a32,956,000      | \u00a336,960                 | \u00a340,095                 | \u00a350,999                 | 80:1        | 74:1        | 58:1        |\n| 2024 | \u00a33,953,000      | \u00a335,794                 | \u00a337,617                 | \u00a353,691                 | 110:1       | 105:1       | 74:1        |\n\n## Base salary\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief Executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a31,222,000      | \u00a330,090                 | \u00a335,918                 | \u00a341,740                 | 37:1        | 31:1        | 27:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,144                 | \u00a337,321                 | \u00a342,800                 | 35:1        | 29:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,842                 | \u00a335,606                 | \u00a342,836                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,637                 | \u00a335,017                 | \u00a343,908                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 25:1        |\n| 2023 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a333,144                 | \u00a335,948                 | \u00a344,986                 | 33:1        | 31:1        | 24:1        |\n| 2024 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,973                 | \u00a334,100                 | \u00a345,948                 | 34:1        | 32:1        | 24:1        |",

Bonus payments in respect of each year have been determined based on the latest available information at the time of analysis. The median total remuneration figure for each group was then used to determine the three ratios.\n\n## Percentage change in remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and all employees\n\nBT Group plc, our parent company, employs our Chairman, Executive and Non-Executive Directors only, and as such no meaningful comparison can be drawn based on the parent company alone, as is required by the reporting regulations.\n\nInstead, we have chosen to present a comparison with our UK management and technical employee population, comprising around 23,000 colleagues.\n\nWe believe this is the most meaningful comparison given the nature of our workforce, as this group has similar performance-related pay arrangements as our Executive Directors.

        "page_content": "## Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The parent company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 and the company financial statements are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (FRS 101 'Reduced disclosure framework', and applicable law).\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company, and of the group's profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently\n- - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and, in respect of the parent Company financial statements only, prudent\n- - state whether the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted international accounting standards\n- - state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed with regards to the parent company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- - assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the parent company, and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 2006 Act. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing an annual strategic report, directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and corporate governance statement that comply with such law and regulation.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the BT Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule ('DTR') 4.1.16R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared under DTR 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with those requirements.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Board in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm, to the best of our knowledge that:\n\n- - the financial statements , prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- - the Strategic report and the Report of the directors include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThis responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 15 May 2024 and was signed on its behalf by:\n\nAllison Kirkby\n\nChief Executive\n\nSimon Lowth\n\nChief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors\n\nThe directors present the Report of the directors, together with audited financial information for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Report of the directors also encompasses the entirety of our Corporate governance report on pages 83 to 130 for the purpose of section 463 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). The Report of the directors together with the Strategic report on pages 1 to 82 form the Management report for the basis of DTR 4.1.5R.\n\nIn accordance with DTR 4.1.14R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format under the TD ESEF Regulation. The Auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over the ESEF format.\n\n## Material accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with UK-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and are set out on page 150 of the consolidated financial statements . The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed that they are appropriate for the preparation of the FY24 consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nAs far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 2006 Act) that hasn't been disclosed to the auditor. Each of the directors confirms that all steps have been taken that ought to have been to make them aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor has been made aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Strategic report on pages 1 to 82 includes information on the group structure, strategy and business model, the performance of each customer-facing unit and the impact of regulation and competition. The Group performance section on pages 50 to 57 includes information on our group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and net debt, and balance sheet position. Notes 23, 25, 26 and 28 of the consolidated financial statements include information on the group's investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, financial risk management objectives, hedging policies and exposure to interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and market risks.\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 63 to 70 including details of each risk and how we manage them. The directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks affecting the group, including any that could threaten our business model, future performance, insolvency or liquidity.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on pages 81 to 82, which has been based on the Company's strategy, balance sheet and financing position, including our \u00a32.1bn undrawn committed borrowing facility which matures in March 2027, and the potential impact of Our principal risks and uncertainties on pages 63 to 70; and which estimates the financial impact for a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually and in combination through stochastic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements . This assessment covers the period to May 2025, which is consistent with FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's overall financial position (including trading results and the ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks (including severe but plausible downsides, refer to the Viability statement on pages 81 to 82).\n\nAt 31 March 2024, the group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a30.4bn and current asset investments of \u00a32.4bn. The group also had access to committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn. These facilities were undrawn at the period-end and are not subject to renewal until March 2027.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nThe Board has a procedure that allows directors to seek independent professional advice at our expense. All directors also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and her nominated delegate.\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnity\n\nWe routinely buy insurance cover for directors, officers and employees in positions of managerial supervision of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries. This is intended to protect against defence costs, civil damages and, in some circumstances, civil fines and penalties (provided they are insurable) following an action brought against them in their personal capacity. The policy also covers individuals serving as directors of other companies or of joint ventures, or on boards of trade associations or charitable organisations at the group's request. The insurance protects the directors and officers directly in circumstances where, by law, BT Group plc cannot provide an indemnity. It also provides the group, subject to a retention, with cover against the cost of indemnifying a director or officer. One layer of insurance is ringfenced for the directors of BT Group plc.\n\nAs at 15 May 2024, and throughout FY24, BT Group plc's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity for a group of people similar to the group covered by the above insurance. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where the individual is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.\n\nAs permitted by BT Group plc's Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by law, the group indemnifies each of its directors and other officers against certain liabilities that may be",

        "page_content": "incurred as a result of their positions within the group. The indemnity was in force throughout the tenure of each director during the last financial year, and remains in force.\n\n## Interest of management in certain transactions\n\nDuring and at the end of FY24, none of BT Group plc's directors were materially interested in any material transaction in relation to the group's business. None are materially interested in any currently proposed material transactions.\n\n## Power to authorise conflicts\n\nAll directors have a duty under the 2006 Act to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the group. BT Group plc's Articles of Association include provisions for dealing with directors' conflicts of interest in accordance with the 2006 Act. The group has procedures in place, which it follows, to deal with such situations. These require the Board to:\n\n- - consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts\n- - consider the conflict situation in conjunction with its other duties under the 2006 Act\n- - keep records and Board minutes on any authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given\n- - regularly review conflict authorisation.\n\nThe Company Secretary maintains a conflicts of interest register.\n\nThe Conflicted Matters Committee identifies to what extent Board and Committee materials are likely to refer to a potential or actual conflict of interest between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom and, as a result, what materials should be shared with our NonIndependent, Non-Executive Director and Deutsche Telekom nominated representative. He owes duties to both BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom, and the Conflicted Matters Committee helps him comply with his fiduciary duties, although ultimate responsibility rests with him.\n\n## Systems of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing the group's systems of risk management and internal control each year, and for ensuring their effectiveness, including in respect of relevant assurance activities. These systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risks we face that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives and delivering our strategy. Any system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nOur group risk management framework is simple and consistent, and defines our (1) risk mindset, (2) risk process and activities; and finally (3) governance. The framework:\n\n- - provides the business with the tools to take on the right risks and make smart risk decisions\n- - supports the identification, assessment and management of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group\n- - is an integral part of BT Group's annual strategic review cycle.\n\nThe framework was designed in accordance with the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting and has been in operation throughout the year and up to the date on which this document was approved. The framework was reviewed in FY24 and was deemed effective. Continuous improvements were made in FY24, including the rollout of a new training programme to establish a core level of understanding of expectations across our senior leadership team and all those with roles that are key to making our framework a success. There was also focus on embedding our Key Control Framework, a set of Group requirements, defined by\n\nsubject matter experts, to be implemented consistently across all Units.\n\nMore information on our group risk management framework can be found in the Risk management section on pages 61 to 62.\n\nInternal audit carry out periodic assessments of the quality of risk management and control, promote effective risk management across all our units and report to management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the status of specific areas identified for improvement. We do not cover joint ventures and associates not controlled by the group in the scope of our group risk management framework. Such third parties are responsible for their own internal control assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit & Risk Committee , on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control across the group. Further details on how the Audit & Risk Committee fulfils these duties can be found on page 102.\n\n## Capital Management and Funding Policy\n\nThe objective of our Capital Management Policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating objectives, while investing in the business, supporting our pension schemes and meeting our Distribution Policy.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews the group's capital structure. Management proposes actions and produces analyses which reflect the group's investment plans and risk characteristics, as well as the macroeconomic conditions in which we operate.\n\nOur Funding Policy is to raise and invest funds centrally to meet the group's anticipated requirements. We use a combination of capital market bond issuance and committed borrowing facilities to fund the group. When issuing debt, in order to avoid refinancing risk, group treasury will take into consideration the maturity profile of the group's debt portfolio, financial market conditions as well as forecast cash flows.\n\nSee note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for details of our Treasury Policy.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the group's financial risk management objectives, policies of the group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange are given in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Credit Risk Management Policy\n\nWe take proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on our financial instruments. In managing investments and derivative financial instruments, group treasury monitors the credit quality across treasury counterparties and actively manages any exposures that arise. Management within the business units also actively monitors any exposures arising from trading balances.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nOther than the financial commitments and contingent liabilities disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements , there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on:\n\n- - our financial condition\n- - changes in financial condition\n- - revenues or expenses\n- - results of operations\n- - liquidity\n- - capital expenditure\n- - capital resources.",

If there is an offer for the shares or another transaction that would lead to a change of control, such participants may direct the trustee to accept the offer or agree to the transaction\n- - in respect of shares held in the Trust, the trustee abstains from voting those shares if there is an offer for the shares. The trustee does not have to accept or reject the offer but will have regard to the interests of the participants, may consult with the participants to obtain their views on the offer, and may otherwise take any action with respect to the offer that it thinks is fair\n- - EasyShare is the group's corporate sponsored nominee service, which allows UK and European Economic Area resident shareholders to hold BT Group plc shares electronically\n- - EasyShare is administered by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. As at 15 May 2024, 419m shares were held in EasyShare (4.21% of the issued share capital (4.22% excluding treasury shares)) on behalf of BT Group plc shareholders\n- - no person holds securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the group\n- - our share registrar, Equiniti, must receive proxy appointment and voting instructions not less than 48 hours before any general meeting (see page 130)\n- - the business of BT Group is managed by the Board. The directors may exercise all the powers of BT Group plc, subject to the Articles of Association, legislation and regulation. This includes the ability to exercise the authority to allot or purchase BT Group plc shares pursuant to shareholders passing an ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n- - we have no agreements with directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment as a result of a takeover.

        "page_content": "## Articles of Association\n\nBT Group plc's current Articles of Association were adopted pursuant to a resolution passed at the AGM of BT Group plc held on 15 July 2021 and contain, amongst others, provisions on the rights and obligations attaching to BT Group plc's shares.\n\nThe Articles of Association may only be amended by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\n- A copy of the current Articles of Association is available at bt.com/articles\n\n## Directors' appointment, retirement and removal\n\nThe Articles of Association regulate the appointment and removal of directors, as does the 2006 Act and related legislation. The Board, and shareholders (by ordinary resolution), may appoint a person who is willing to be elected as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. At every AGM, all directors must automatically retire. A retiring director is eligible for election or re-election, as applicable. In addition to any power of removal under the 2006 Act, the shareholders can pass an ordinary resolution to remove a director.\n\nRaphael K\u00fcbler was appointed as a Non-Independent, NonExecutive Director under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom. His appointment is terminable immediately by either party.\n\n## Share rights\n\n## (a) Voting rights\n\nOn a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.\n\nThere are no restrictions on exercising voting rights except in situations where BT Group plc is legally entitled to impose such a restriction (for example where a notice under section 793 of the 2006 Act has been served).\n\n## (b) Variation of rights\n\nIf the share capital of BT Group plc were to be split into different classes of shares by special resolution, the special rights attached to any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either: (i) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or (ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class. BT Group plc can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally. BT Group plc currently has one class of shares.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nThere is no specific restriction on the transfer of BT Group plc shares in the group, which is governed by the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\n## Political donations\n\nOur policy is that no company in the group will make contributions in cash or in kind to any political party, whether by gift or loan. However, the definition of political donations used in the 2006 Act is significantly broader than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. The 2006 Act's remit could cover making\n\nmembers of Parliament and others in the political world aware of key industry issues and matters affecting BT Group plc, and enhancing their understanding of the group.\n\nThe authority for political donations requested at the 2024 AGM is not intended to change this policy. It does, however, ensure that the group continues to act within the provisions of the 2006 Act, requiring companies to obtain shareholder authority before they make donations to political parties and/or political organisations as defined in the 2006 Act. During FY24, BT Group plc's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, paid the costs of attending events at (i) the Labour Party Conference and Business Conference; (ii) the Conservative Party Conference; and (iii) the Liberal Democrats Business Day. These costs totalled \u00a39,343 (FY23: \u00a35,848). No company in the BT Group made any loans to any political party.\n\n## Substantial shareholdings\n\nAs at 31 March 2024, BT Group plc had received notice, under the DTRs, in respect of the following holdings of 3% or more of the voting rights in its issued ordinary share capital:\n\n|                    | Date of notification   | Shares        | % of total  voting rights   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| Altice UK S.\u00e0 r.l. | 22 May 2023            | 2,435,476,188 | 24.50%                      |\n| T-Mobile  Holdings | 23 March 2018          | 1,196,175,322 | 12.06%                      |\n| BlackRock, Inc.    | 13 June 2023           | 470,325,337   | 4.73%                       |\n\nAs at 15 May 2024, BT Group had not received any further such notices under the DTRs.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nEngaging with our colleagues is critical to creating a culture where they can be their best and contribute to our purpose, ambition, strategy and long term success.\n\nEngaging with our colleagues takes many forms, including through:\n\n- - the Board receiving regular updates from the Chief Executive and Chief Human Resources Officer on colleagues, key people strategy initiatives, culture and overall sentiment in the organisation\n- - our Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement and the Colleague Board . The Colleague Board was in place throughout most of FY24, however the Board made the decision to disband the Colleague Board and going forward the Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement will engage in a comprehensive colleague outreach programme in its place (see pages 90 to 91)\n- - our quarterly Your Say colleague engagement surveys\n- - regular colleague communications.\n\nColleagues are kept well informed on matters such as the strategy and performance of the group, including after certain key events such as results and trading updates. We work with our highly active, engaged and award-winning People Networks. These colleague-driven groups raise awareness and advocate for change both inside and outside BT Group.\n\nColleague engagement is 75%, +5% vs UK external benchmarks and +4% since September. The resolution of industrial action and agreement for a two-year pay award have contributed to the improvement in sentiment.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors continued\n\nWe encourage all of our colleagues to become shareholders in the business through the operation of all-employee share plans. We annually consider which all-employee plans to offer, both in the UK and globally.\n\n## Employees with disabilities\n\nWe're an inclusive employer and actively encourage the recruitment, development, promotion and retention of disabled people.\n\nIn FY24 we focused on three areas to support our disabled colleagues:\n\n- - we committed to improving our workplace adjustments process so that colleagues can get the adjustments that they need when they need them, with a new initiative in the UK launched in July with plans to extend the rollout to India\n- - a development programme specifically aimed at disabled colleagues who are junior managers has been piloted, and work is under consideration for rollout to all career levels\n- - we want all colleagues and people managers to understand disability and how to support disabled colleagues, so we have launched three disability advocacy training pathways and published them to our internal disability hub for access by all colleagues.\n\nThis is the first year that we reported our disability pay gap; it reflects our drive for equal opportunity across all characteristics. At the time of the snapshot date in April 2023, the mean and median pay gaps were low, with a mean gap of 0.7% and a zero median gap. Further information can be found on page 32.\n\nWe continued our partnership with the Business Disability Forum, and we will be working to make sure that we are able to meet and exceed the commitments we made to obtain our Disability Confident leader status and our membership of Valuable 500.\n\nRead more on inclusion and diversity at bt.com/inclusion-and-diversity\n\n## AGM\n\n## Resolutions\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on all resolutions including the Annual Report, the Report on directors' remuneration , the election/re-election of directors, the reappointment of KPMG LLP as our external auditor and to authorise the Audit & Risk Committee to agree its remuneration, giving authority to the directors to allot BT Group plc shares and disapply pre-emption rights.\n\nBefore the AGM, our share registrar, Equiniti, will count the proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as votes withheld. The voting results will be announced by way of a stock exchange announcement and published on our website as soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of the AGM. As at previous AGMs, we will take votes on all matters at the 2024 AGM on a poll.\n\nThe separate Notice of meeting 2024, which we send to all shareholders who have requested shareholder documents by post, contains the resolutions (with explanatory notes) which we will propose at the 2024 AGM on 11 July 2024. We notify all shareholders of the publication of these documents which are available on our website at bt.com/annualreport\n\n## Authority to purchase shares\n\nThe authority given at the 2023 AGM for BT Group plc to purchase in the market 993m of its shares, representing 10% of BT Group plc's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares), expires at\n\nthe conclusion of the 2024 AGM. We will ask shareholders to give a similar authority at the 2024 AGM.\n\nDuring FY24 and up to 15 May 2024, no shares were purchased under this authority.\n\nAt the start of the year, \u00a336m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a31.8m, and constituting 0.36% of the issued share capital (0.36% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares. During FY24, 19.8m treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a3995,000, and constituting 0.19% of the issued share capital 0.20% excluding treasury shares)) were transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans. At 31 March 2024, a total of 16.3m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a3815,000, and constituting 0.16% of the issued share capital 0.16% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements ).\n\nSince 31 March 2024 (up to and including 15 May 2024), 552,071 treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a327,600, and constituting 0.005% of the issued share capital (0.005% excluding treasury shares)) have been transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans.\n\nAt 15 May 2024, a total of 15.7m shares (having a nominal value of \u00a3787,300, and constituting 0.16% of the issued share capital (0.16% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares.\n\nIn addition, during FY24 and up to 15 May 2024 the Trust purchased 98.2m BT Group plc shares for a total consideration of \u00a3132.5m. The Trust held 158.4m shares both at 31 March 2024 and 15 May 2024.\n\n## Cross-reference to the Strategic report\n\nWe have chosen to include the following information in the Strategic report in line with the 2006 Act (otherwise required by law to be included in the Report of the directors ):\n\n- - the final dividend proposed by the Board (page 51)\n- - an indication of likely future developments in the business of BT Group plc and its group (pages 1 to 82)\n- - an indication of our research and development activities (page 15)\n- - information about how the directors engaged with UK employees, had regard to UK employee interests, and the effect of that regard, including on principal decisions during the year (pages 24, 41 and 90 to 91)\n- - information about how the directors have had regard to the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and the effect of that regard, including on principal decisions during the year (pages 26 to 27, 40 to 45 and 90 to 91)\n- - information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy efficiency action (pages 38, 71 to 80).\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Sabine Chalmers\n\nGroup General Counsel, Company Secretary & Director Regulatory Affairs 15 May 2024",

Our opinion is unmodified\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- - the financial statements of BT Group plc give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2024, and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- - the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and\n- - the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## What our opinion covers\n\nWe have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of BT Group plc ('the Company') for the year ended 31 March 2024 ('FY24') included in the Annual Report, which comprise:\n\n## Group\n\n- - Group income statement,\n- - Group statement of comprehensive income,\n- - Group balance sheet,\n- - Group statement of changes in equity,\n- - Group cash flow statement\n- - Notes 1 to 33 to the Group financial statements, including the accounting policies in the respective notes.\n\n## Parent Company (BT Group plc)\n\n- - Company balance sheet\n- - Company statement of changes in equity\n- - Notes 1 to 3 to the Parent Company financial statements, including the accounting policies in note 1.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee ('ARC').\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nOur risk assessment is driven by understanding of the applicable financial reporting framework, our knowledge of the business, the industry and the wider economic environment in which BT Group plc operates.\n\nRevenue from non-long-term contracts remains a focus area due to the complexity arising from the large number of low value transactions managed through a number of distinct billing systems, and the complex IT landscape linking the billing systems together.\n\nIn addition, the bespoke nature of the pricing structure within some of Business' contracts means that there is a higher risk of processing error and fraud in relation to a proportion of Business' revenue derived from certain billing systems and estimation uncertainty over the associated refund liabilities.\n\nIn the current year the Group recognised an impairment charge against goodwill allocated to the Business cash generating unit (CGU) of \u00a3488mn (FY23: nil), reflecting the execution risk of the CGU's business plan and increased uncertainty over the projected cashflows.\n\nThe valuation of the BT pension scheme ('BTPS') defined obligation also remains a focus area as it is complex, relying on key actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, RPI, and mortality.\n\nWe continue to have a focus on the BTPS which holds diverse unquoted assets which are valued based on inputs not directly observable. The valuation of these assets requires the involvement of experts and significant judgement over the key unobservable input.\n\nWe continue to identify the recoverability of the Parent Company investment in subsidiaries as a focus area for the Parent Company's standalone accounts. This is due to the materiality of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries compared to the company's total assets.\n\nThe TNT Sport Joint venture company is in its second year of operations and all significant risks associated with the initial recognition of the balances relating to the disposal of the BT sports division and subsequent re-investment in the Sports JV are no longer applicable.\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                                                 | Risk FY24 vs FY23   |   Item |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| Accuracy of revenue due to complex  billing systems (Group)                       | \u00e9                   |    4.1 |\n| Impairment of Goodwill attributable to  Business CGU (Group)                      | \u2026                   |    4.2 |\n| Valuation of defined benefit obligation  of the BT pension scheme (BTPS)  (Group) | \u00e7\u00e8                  |    4.3 |\n| Valuation of unquoted investments in  the BT pension scheme (BTPS) (Group)        | \u00ea                   |    4.4 |\n| Recoverability of Parent company  investment in subsidiaries (Parent  Company)    | \u00e7\u00e8                  |    4.5 |\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee Interaction\n\nDuring the year, the ARC met 6 times. KPMG are invited to attend all ARC meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the ARC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the ARC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.\n\nThe matters included in the Audit and Risk Committee Chair's report on pages 99 to 103 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\n## Our Independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nWe have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 31 March 2024 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2019. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 6 financial years ended 31 March 2024.\n\nJonathan Mills has succeeded John Luke as the Lead Engagement Partner for the year ended 31 March 2024. The Group Engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As these are the first set of the Group's financial statements signed by Jonathan Mills, he will be required to rotate off after the FY28 audit.",

We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at \u00a3135m (FY23: \u00a395m) and for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole at \u00a3100m (FY23: \u00a390m).\n\nA key judgement in determining materiality was selecting the most relevant metric as the benchmark, considering which metrics have the greatest bearing on shareholder decisions. The relevant metrics considered for the current year included Revenue, Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (\"EBITDA\"), Profit before tax from continuing operations (\"PBTCO\"), and Total assets. The selected benchmark for the current year is \"Revenue,\" which represents a change from the prior period where the selected benchmark was PBTCO. The change to Revenue is deemed appropriate given shareholders' focus on revenue and cash generation and the current stage of the Fibre To The Premise ('FTTP') capital investment program. In the context of the high levels of capital investment for future growth, Revenue is considered a more representative and stable measure of performance. As such, we based our Group materiality on Total Revenue, of which it represents 0.65% (FY23: 4.95% of normalised PBTCO).\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3100m (FY23: \u00a390m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, limited to be less than materiality for Group materiality as a whole. It represents 0.89% (FY23: 0.80%) of the stated benchmark.\n\n## Materiality levels used in our audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Group   | Group Materiality                    |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|\n| GPM     | Group Performance Materiality        |\n| HCM     | Highest Component Materiality        |\n| PLC     | Parent Company Materiality           |\n| LCM     | Lowest Component Materiality         |\n| AMPT    | Audit Misstatement Posting Threshold |\n\n## Group scope (Item 7 below)\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world.\n\nThe total number of entities in scope for FY24 is three which is consistent with FY23.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated on page 134.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.",

As a part of our audit, we have performed a risk assessment, including enquiries of management, to understand how the impact of commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change, as well as the physical and transition risks of climate change, may affect the financial statements and our audit.\n\nThe potential impacts of these matters relate to the forwardlooking estimates, which include projections for impairment assessment of goodwill, useful economic life of vehicle fleet and infrastructure assets impacting on future depreciation charges, and significant assumptions used in pension asset valuations. Taking into account our risk assessment procedures, the remaining useful economic lives of relevant assets and the nature of the assumptions used in the pension valuation, and the financial impact of climate risk and opportunities on the forecasted cashflows, we have assessed that there is not a significant risk to the balances in the financial statements as a result of climate change. Therefore, there is no material impact on the Group's critical accounting estimates and our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the disclosures of climate related information in the annual report and considered their consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures in the Annual Report.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- - The impact of rising energy prices, supply shortages, and inflationary pressures;\n- - The impact of significant supply chain disruptions driven by geopolitical factors;\n- - The impact of plans to deliver new initiatives required to meet savings commitments not being realised;\n- - The likelihood of existing litigation crystallising within the going concern period.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as a large scale cyber breach, the UK experiencing a significant recession, adverse changes to telecoms regulation, which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.",

        "page_content": "Our procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern. Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- - We consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company's financial statements is appropriate;\n- - We have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- - We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and\n- - The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 126 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longerterm viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- - the directors' confirmation within the Viability statement on page 81 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- - the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- - the directors' explanation in the Viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability statement set out on page 81 under the Listing Rules.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 4. Key audit matters (KAM)\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- - the overall audit strategy;\n- - the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- - directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures.

The Group operates a number of distinct billing and order-entry systems and the IT landscape underpinning the end-to-end revenue process is complex.\n\nThere are multiple products sold at multiple rates with varying price structures in place. These represent a combination of service-based products, such as fixed line telephony, as well as goods, such as the provision of mobile handsets.\n\nThe revenue recognition of non-long-term contract revenue is not subject to significant judgement. However, due to the large number of transactions, manual nature of order entry and complexity of the billing systems, this is considered to be an area of most significance in our audit. Within Business we have identified a significant risk of processing error in relation to some billing systems. In addition, the bespoke nature of the pricing structure within some of Business' contracts means that there is a higher risk of processing error and fraud in relation to a proportion of Business' revenue derived from certain billing systems.\n\n## Subjective estimate of refund liabilities in Business\n\nThe bespoke pricing structure results in a risk of billing inaccuracies within a proportion of Business' revenue and so over the identification of financial liabilities for associated customer refunds. The Group have estimated refund liabilities based on the",

There is also estimation uncertainty over the appropriate terminal growth rate and discount rate applied to the projected cashflows.\n\nIn the current year the Group recognised an impairment charge against goodwill allocated to the Business CGU of \u00a3488mn (FY23: nil), reflecting the execution risk of the CGU's business plan and increased uncertainty over the projected cashflows.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the value in use used to support the recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to the Business CGU has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable impairment outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.

These included those posted by senior finance management, those posted and approved by the same user and those posted to unusual or seldom used accounts;\n- - Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias;\n- - Increased testing over certain revenue streams in Business.\n- - Evaluating the business purpose for significant unusual transactions.\n\n## Laws and regulations - Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Laws and regulations risk assessment\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the Group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group audit team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/ regulation areas\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, regulations affecting telecommunication providers, and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities (including compliance with Ofcom regulation) and its legal form.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Known actual or suspected matters\n\nFor the legal matters discussed in note 18 we assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal correspondence.\n\n## Significant actual or suspected breaches discussed with Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee other matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Context\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## \u00a3135m\n\n## (FY23: \u00a395m)\n\n## Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3135m (FY23: \u00a395m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of Total Revenue (of which it represents 0.65% (FY23: 4.95% of normalised PBTCO)).\n\nA key judgement in determining materiality was selecting the most relevant metric as the benchmark, considering which metrics have the greatest bearing on shareholder decisions. The relevant metrics considered for the current year included Revenue, Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA'), Profit before tax from continuing operations ('PBTCO'), and Total assets. The selected benchmark for the current year is \"Revenue,\" which represents a change from the prior period where the selected benchmark was PBTCO. The change to Revenue is deemed appropriate given shareholders' focus on revenue and cash generation and the current stage of the Fibre To The Premise ('FTTP') capital investment program. In the context of the high levels of capital investment for future growth, Revenue is considered a more representative and stable measure of performance.\n\nOur Group materiality of \u00a3135m was determined by applying a percentage to the Total Revenue. When using a benchmark of Total Revenue to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 0.5% - 1% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 0.65% (FY23: 4.95% of normalised PBTCO) to the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the Parent company financial statements as a whole at \u00a3100m (FY23: \u00a390m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, limited to be less than materiality for Group materiality as a whole. It represents 0.89% (FY23: 0.80%) of the stated benchmark.\n\n## \u00a387.7m (FY23: \u00a361.7m)\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY23: 65%) of materiality for BT Group plc's Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nThe Parent company performance materiality was set at \u00a365m (FY23: \u00a358.5m), which equates to 65% (FY23: 65%) of materiality for the Parent company financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the level of identified misstatements and control deficiencies during the year and the prior year.\n\n## \u00a35.4m (FY23: \u00a34.75m) Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.\n\nThis is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to BT Group plc's Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied\n\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 4% (FY23: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u00a3135m (FY23: \u00a395m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group has 215 (FY23: 226) reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (FY23: 10%) of revenue or total assets. We selected revenue and total assets because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 2 (FY23: 2) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nWe selected 1 (FY23: 1) components for which we performed work other than audits for Group reporting purposes, that was not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group's results.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results, with the prior year comparatives indicated in brackets:\n\n| Scope                     | Number of  components   | Range of materiality  applied   | Group Revenue   | Group PBT   | Group Total assets   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Full scope audit          | 2 (2)                   | (\u00a360m - \u00a380m)                   | 87% (86%)       | 83% (78%)   | 96% (90%)            |\n| Specified audit procedure | 1(1)                    | \u00a350m (\u00a335m)                     | 0% (0%)         | 10%* (11%)  | 0% (0%)              |\n\n*as a % of Total operating cost\n\nFor the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within those.\n\nThe work on 1 of the 3 in scope components (FY23: 1 of the 3 in scope components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Parent company, was performed by the Group audit team.\n\nThe Group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- - Testing of IT Systems\n- - Litigation and claims\n\nThese items were audited by the Group team for efficiency purposes, where the Group team has direct access to the underlying information. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation\n\n## Preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on pages 81 to 82, which has been based on the Company's strategy, balance sheet and financing position, including our \u00a32.1bn undrawn committed borrowing facility which matures in March 2027, and the potential impact of 'Our principal risks and uncertainties' (pages 63 to 70); and which estimates the financial impact of a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually, in combination and through stochastic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the group and parent company financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2025, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's and parent company's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors have considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the risks identified in the TCFD disclosure on pages 71 to 80 this year. There has been no material impact identified in respect of the judgements and estimates reported in these financial statements. The following impacts were considered:\n\n- - Low carbon fleet - see note 14\n\nThese financial statements consolidate BT Group plc, the parent company, and its subsidiaries (together the 'group', 'us', 'we' or 'our').\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of BT Group plc.\n\nThese financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 ('FY24'), with comparative figures for the financial year from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 ('FY23').\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThe following amended standards were effective during the year, none of which had a material impact on the financial statements of the group:\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nBT adopted IFRS 17 with retrospective application on 1 April 2023.\n\nThe standard establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The measurement method for insurance contracts required by IFRS 17 is a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, including a best estimate and an adjustment for non-financial risk calculated for groups of similar contracts.\n\nIFRS 17 primarily impacts insurance entities, however, as it applies to individual contracts it is possible that non-insurers could issue contracts that are in scope of the standard such as product breakdown contracts or warranties.\n\nWe have assessed the impact of the standard on the group, and concluded that its impact is not material. Contracts in scope of the standard entered into by the group are restricted to intragroup insurance arrangements; the group does not issue external insurance contracts.\n\n## Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)\n\nThese amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. The amendments have not resulted in any changes to accounting policies disclosures made in these financial statements.\n\n## International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes)\n\nThe IASB amended the scope of IAS 12 to introduce a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for top-up tax arising from the implementation of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. This was endorsed in the UK in July 2023 and applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nThe group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\n## Other\n\nThe following changes have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n\n- - Definition of Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8)\n- - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)\n\n## IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decisions\n\nThe IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) periodically issues agenda decisions which explain and clarify how to apply the principles and requirements of IFRS. Agenda decisions are authoritative and may require the group to revise accounting policies or practice to align with the interpretations set out in the decision.\n\nWe regularly review IFRIC updates and assess the impact of agenda decisions. No agenda decisions finalised during FY24 have been assessed as having a significant impact on the group.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective\n\nThe following new or amended standards and interpretations are applicable in future periods and are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n## Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7)\n\nThe amendments will apply to the group from FY25 onwards and require new disclosures relating to supplier finance arrangements that assist in assessing their effects on liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.\n\nWe participate in supply chain financing arrangements which the amendments will apply to, see note 17. We will include the required disclosures in the FY25 financial statements.\n\n## Other\n\nThe following are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n- - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\n- - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\n- - Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)\n\n## Accounting policy and operating segment changes\n\nDuring FY24 we changed the methodology used to allocate certain internal costs and our Business CFU began reporting as a single unit.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Basis of preparation continued\n\n## Allocation of central costs\n\nFrom 1 April 2023 we have revised the methodology used to allocate shared Network, Digital and support function costs across our units to more closely align the recharges received by each unit to their actual consumption and establish clearer driver-focused allocation of cost, harmonise principles for pricing and profitability, and support greater unit cost ownership and management and decision making.\n\nThis represents an accounting policy change and in line with the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors we have re-presented FY23 comparatives to enable comparability across periods.\n\n## Creation of the Business unit\n\nAs disclosed in the FY23 financial statements, the Enterprise and Global CFUs have been combined into a single CFU, Business, which began reporting as a single unit from 1 April 2023.\n\nIn line with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, we have re-presented FY23 comparatives to reflect the combined unit.\n\n## Re-presentation of prior year comparatives\n\nThese changes have resulted in re-presentation of prior year comparatives. Changes affect segmental disclosures only and have no impact on the overall reported group financial results.\n\nThe following disclosures are impacted by the creation of the Business unit only. Re-presentation of prior year comparatives is limited to the combination of the balances previously reported in respect of the Enterprise and Global units, with no further adjustments:\n\n- - Note 5 Revenue: disaggregation of external revenue\n- - Note 7 Employees: number of employees\n- - Note 16 Trade and other receivables: trade receivables not past due and accrued income by CFU\n\nNote 4 Segment information is also impacted by changes to the allocation of shared costs. Re-presentation of comparatives has involved adjustments to reallocate internal costs to report on a like-for-like basis with FY24 and to remove internal trading between the Enterprise and Global units. Note 32 presents a bridge between previously published FY23 financial information and comparatives presented in these disclosures: Also presented is a bridge in respect of the CFU normalised free cash flow comparatives which are re-presented in the Additional information on page 231 .\n\n## Presentation of specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting of trading results. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, impairment of goodwill, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, historical property-related provisions, significant out-of-period contract settlements, net interest on our\n\npension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nMovements relating to the sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), such as fair value gains or losses on the A and C preference shares or impairment charges on the equity-accounted investment are classified as specific. Refer to note 24 for further detail.\n\nSpecific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 9.\n\n## 2. Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying our accounting policies. We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience. As the use of estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates that carry a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We also make other key estimates when preparing the financial statements, which, while not meeting the definition of a critical estimate, involve a higher degree of complexity and can reasonably be expected to be of relevance to a user of the financial statements. Management has discussed its critical and other key accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit and Risk Committee .\n\nSignificant judgements are those made by management in applying our material accounting policies that have a material impact on the amounts presented in the financial statements. We may exercise significant judgement in our critical and key accounting estimates.\n\nOur critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements are described in the following notes to the financial\n\nstatements. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\n| Note                                                                         | Critical  estimate   | Key estimate   | Significant  judgement   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| 5.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 3. Material accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\nThe material accounting policies applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are set out below. Other material accounting policies applicable to a particular area are disclosed in the most relevant note. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\nWe have applied all policies consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries, and include its share of the results of associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The group recognises its direct rights to (and its share of) jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations under the appropriate headings in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another entity, known as the parent or investor. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries, which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original business combination and non-controlling share of changes in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the group's financial statements.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from and up to the date of change of control. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned with the policies adopted by the group. All intra-group transactions including any gains or losses, balances, income or expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nWhen the group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item.\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the group has joint control, whereby the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost (including transaction costs) except where they relate to a retained non-controlling interest in a former subsidiary, which is initially recognised at a deemed cost being the fair value of the retained interest. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equityaccounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\n## Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment to be sold to customers are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value, taking into account expected revenue from the sale of packages comprising a mobile handset and a subscription. Cost corresponds to purchase or production cost determined by either the first in first out (FIFO) or average cost method.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with the grants have been complied with and the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase or production of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the related assets and reduce future depreciation expense accordingly. Grants for the reimbursement of operating expenditure are deducted from the related category of costs in the income statement. Estimates and judgements applied in accounting for government grants received in respect of Building Digital UK (BDUK) and other rural superfast broadband contracts are described in note 14.\n\nOnce a government grant is recognised, any related deferred income is treated in accordance with IAS 20 'Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance'.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the company's functional currency. Each group entity determines its own functional currency.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into the group's presentation currency at year end exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign undertakings are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. There is no material exposure to companies operating in hyperinflationary economies.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference associated with the undertaking in the translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure, including the cost of internally developed software, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group from the asset being developed, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.\n\nCapitalisation ceases when the asset being developed is ready for use. Research and development costs include direct and indirect labour, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits (leaver costs) are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. We recognise termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to the affected employees leaving the group.",

Segment information\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to segment information\n\n## Operating and reportable segments\n\nOur operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Executive Committee, which is the key management committee and represents the 'chief operating decision maker'.\n\nOur organisational structure reflects the different customer groups to which we provide communications products and services via our customer-facing units (CFUs). The CFUs are our reportable segments and generate substantially all of our revenue.\n\nDuring the year to 31 March 2024 the group had three CFUs: Consumer, Business and Openreach. Business was formed from the merger of the Global and Enterprise units during FY23 and has been monitored by the Executive Committee on a consolidated basis since 1 April 2023.\n\nThe CFUs are supported by technology units (TUs) comprising Digital and Networks; and corporate units (CUs) including procurement and property management. TUs and CUs are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' for any of the years presented.\n\nWe aggregate the remaining operations and include them in the 'Other' category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group. The 'Other' category includes unallocated TU costs and our CUs.\n\n## Allocation of certain items to segments\n\nProvisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the 'Other' segment. On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the results of the relevant CFU and offset in the group results through the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the 'Other' segment. Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the definition of specific items as detailed in note 9, in which case they are not reflecting in the results of the reportable segment in line with how they are reported to the Executive Committee.\n\nThe costs incurred by TUs and CUs are recharged to the CFUs to reflect the services provided to them. Depreciation and amortisation incurred by TUs in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the CFUs is allocated to the CFUs based on their respective utilisation. Capital expenditure incurred by TUs for specific projects undertaken on behalf of the CFUs is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred. Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular CFU, capital expenditure is allocated among them based on the proportion of estimated future economic benefits.\n\nSpecific items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reflects how they are reported to the Executive Committee. Finance expense and income are not allocated to the reportable segments, as the central treasury function manages this activity, together with the overall net debt position of the group.\n\n## Measuring segment performance\n\nPerformance of each reportable segment is measured based on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the CFUs because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specific items, which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.  We also increasingly track adjusted operating profit which reflects the growing depreciation expense arising from our elevated network investment.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nOur revenue recognition policy is set out in note 5.\n\n## Internal revenue and costs\n\nMost of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the other CFUs, including the use of BT Ireland's network. This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through TUs which are included within the 'Other' segment. Business internal revenue arises from Consumer for mobile Ethernet access and TUs for transmission planning services. Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price. Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant CFUs and therefore the profitability of CFUs may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.\n\n## Geographic segmentation\n\nThe UK is our country of domicile and is where we generate the majority of our revenue from external UK customers. The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country in which the customer is invoiced. The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which excludes derivative financial instruments, investments, preference shares in joint ventures, retirement benefit schemes in surplus and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.",

Revenue\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to revenue\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers in scope of IFRS 15\n\nMost revenue recognised by the group is in scope of IFRS 15, excluding Openreach where most revenue is in scope of IFRS 16. The revenue recognition policy for both is set out below.\n\nOn inception of the contract we identify a 'performance obligation' for each of the distinct goods or services we have promised to provide to the customer. The consideration specified in the contract with the customer is allocated to each performance obligation identified based on their relative standalone selling prices, and is recognised as revenue as they are satisfied.\n\nThe table below summarises the performance obligations we have identified for our major service lines and provides information on the timing of when they are satisfied and the related revenue recognition policy. Also detailed in this note is revenue expected to be recognised in future periods for contracts in place at 31 March 2024 that contain unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n| Service line                                                             | Performance obligations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Revenue recognition policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Information and  communications  technology (ICT)  and managed  networks | Provision of networked IT services, managed network  services, and arrangements to design and build  software solutions. Performance obligations are  identified for each distinct service or deliverable for  which the customer has contracted, and are  considered to be satisfied over the time period that we  deliver these services or deliverables. Commitments to  provide hardware to customers that are distinct from  the other promises are considered to be satisfied at the  point in time that control passes to the customer.                                                | Revenue for services is recognised over time using a  measure of progress that appropriately reflects the  pattern by which the performance obligation is  satisfied.

Performance obligations exist for each ongoing service  provided to the customer and are satisfied over the  period that the services are provided.

These are satisfied  when the customer benefits from the service.  Connection services are not distinct performance | Fixed subscription charges are recognised as revenue  on a straight-line basis over the period that the  services are provided. Upfront charges for non-distinct  connection and installation services are deferred as  contract liabilities and are recognised as revenue over  the same period.

        "page_content": "## 5. Revenue continued\n\nWe recognise revenue based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Determining the standalone selling price often requires judgement and may be derived from regulated prices, list prices, a cost-plus derived price or the price of similar products when sold on a standalone basis by BT or a competitor. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the contract price when this represents a bespoke price that would be the same for a similar customer in a similar circumstance.\n\nThe fixed access and mobile subscription arrangements sold by our Consumer business are typically payable in advance, with any variable or one-off charges billed in arrears. Contracts are largely inflation-linked with price increases recognised when effective. Payment is received immediately for direct sales of equipment to customers. Where equipment is provided to customers under mobile and fixed access subscription arrangements, payment for the equipment is received over the course of the contract term. For sales by our enterprise businesses, invoices are issued in line with contractual terms. Payments received in advance are recognised as contract liabilities; amounts billed in arrears are recognised as contract assets.\n\nWe adopt variable consideration to allocate the transaction price to take account of the likelihood of the customer upgrading to a new handset during the contract term. Consideration is constrained to a period shorter than the contract term and is allocated to the handset and airtime based on relative standalone selling price. Certain Business long term contracts offer rebates to our customers. Where this is the case we make an estimate of variable consideration at the outset of the contract based on assumed volumes. These rebates are normally settled monthly against service revenues.\n\nWe are applying the practical expedient to recognise revenue 'as-invoiced' for certain fixed access and mobile subscription services revenues. Where we have a right to invoice at an amount that directly corresponds with performance to date, we recognise revenue at that amount. We have also adopted the practical expedient not to calculate the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied for these contracts.\n\nWe do not have any material obligations in respect of returns, refunds or warranties.\n\nWhere we act as an agent in a transaction, such as insurance services offered, we recognise commission net of directly attributable costs.\n\nWe exercise judgement in assessing whether the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contracts are distinct from the other services to be delivered under the contract and therefore represent distinct performance obligations. This determines whether revenue is recognised in the early stages of the contract, or deferred until delivery of the other services promised in the contract begins.\n\nWe recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable. If these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable. We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate. Key factors reviewed include:\n\n- - Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.\n- - Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.\n- - The status of commercial relations with customers and the implications for future revenue and cost projections.\n- - Our estimates of future staff and third party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.\n\n## Revenue from lease arrangements in scope of IFRS 16\n\nSome consumer broadband and TV products and arrangements to provide external communications providers with exclusive use of Openreach's fixed-network telecommunications infrastructure meet the definition of operating leases under IFRS 16.\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains, a lease following the accounting policy set out in note 15. Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease in which we act as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases at lease inception based on an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case then the lease is a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. For sub-leases, we make this assessment by reference to the characteristics of the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease rather than the underlying leased asset.\n\nIncome from arrangements classified as operating leases is presented as revenue where it relates to our core operating activities, for example leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers and leases of devices to consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription products. Operating lease income from other arrangements is presented within other operating income (note 6).\n\nWe recognise operating lease payments as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any upfront payments received, such as connection fees, are deferred over the lease term. Determining the lease term is subject to the significant judgements set out in note 15.\n\nWhere the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the transaction price is allocated between the components on the basis of relative standalone selling price.\n\nWhere an arrangement is assessed as a finance lease we derecognise the underlying asset and recognise a receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease. Finance lease receivables are presented in note 16. The receivable is measured based on future payments to be received discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, adjusted for any direct costs. Any difference between the derecognised asset and the finance lease receivable is recognised in the income statement. Where the nature of services delivered relates to our core operating activities it is presented as revenue. Where it relates to non-core activities it is presented within other operating income (note 6).",

See note 9.\n- b Comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented for the impact of the creation of our Business customer-facing unit, formed through the merger of our Enterprise and Global units, see note 1.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognised in future periods for performance obligations that are not complete (or are partially complete) as at 31 March 2024 is \u00a312,133m (FY23: \u00a312,792m). Of this, \u00a36,052m (FY23: \u00a36,592m) relates to ICT and managed services contracts and equipment and other services which will substantially be recognised as revenue within three years. Fixed access and mobile subscription services typically have shorter contract periods and so \u00a36,081m (FY23: \u00a36,200m) will substantially be recognised as revenue within two years.\n\nRevenue recognised this year relating to performance obligations that were satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous years was not material. Revenue related to customers' unexercised rights (for example, unused amounts on prepaid SIM cards) was not material.\n\n## Key accounting estimates made in accounting for revenue Estimate of customer refunds\n\nRevenue has been adjusted to reflect a risk of billing inaccuracy where there is a high level of manual processing through certain billing systems. This is associated with a small number of products within our Business unit which contain bespoke pricing. \u00a341m has been recognised as an IFRS 9 financial liability and deducted from revenue, and has been derived from an estimate of the possible range of the adjustment from \u00a324m to \u00a364m based on the results of a sample of billing items. This is presented within Note 17  and represents our best estimate required to cover ongoing billing adjustments to products relating to both current and prior periods. If the final quantum of adjustments is less than expected, the adjustment will be released back to the income statement.\n\n## Lease income\n\nPresented within revenue is \u00a33,031m (FY23: \u00a32,909m) income from arrangements classified as operating leases under IFRS 16 and which represent core business activities for the group. Income relates predominantly to Openreach's leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers, classified as fixed access subscription revenue in the table above, and leases of devices to Consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription offerings, classified as equipment and other services.\n\nDuring the year we also recognised:\n\n- - \u00a326m (FY23: \u00a329m) operating lease income from non-core business activities which is presented in other operating income (note 6). Note 15 presents an analysis of payments to be received across the remaining term of operating lease arrangements.\n- - \u00a340m (FY23: \u00a358m) revenue in relation to upfront gains from arrangements meeting the definition of a finance lease. These arrangements meet the criteria for revenue recognition as they concern leases and sub-leases of telecommunications infrastructure that represent core business activities of the group.\n\n\u00a338m (FY23: \u00a369m) of this income relates to the sub-leasing of right-of-use assets. These are primarily operating sub-leases of unutilised properties, and finance sub-leases of telecommunications infrastructure.",

Revenue continued\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to contract assets and liabilities\n\nWe recognise contract assets for goods and services for which control has transferred to the customer before we have the right to bill. These assets mainly relate to mobile handsets provided upfront but paid for over the course of a contract.  Contract assets are reclassified as receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional and we have billed the customer.\n\nContract liabilities are recognised when we have received advance payment for goods and services that we have not transferred to the customer. These primarily relate to fees received for connection and installation services that are not distinct performance obligations.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition or transformation phase of a long-term contract is considered to be a distinct performance obligation we recognise a contract asset for any work performed but not billed. Conversely a contract liability is recognised where these activities are not distinct performance obligations and we receive upfront consideration. In this case eligible costs associated with delivering these services are capitalised as fulfilment costs, see note 16.\n\nWe provide for expected lifetime losses on contract assets following the policy set out in note 16.\n\nContract assets and liabilities are as follows:\n\n| At 31 March          | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Contract assets      |           |           |\n| Current              | 1,410     | 1,565     |\n| Non-current          | 330       | 369       |\n|                      | 1,740     | 1,934     |\n| Contract liabilities |           |           |\n| Current              | 906       | 859       |\n| Non-current          | 175       | 193       |\n|                      | 1,081     | 1,052     |\n\n\u00a3876m of the contract liability at 31 March 2023 was recognised as revenue during the year (FY23: \u00a3903m). Impairment losses of \u00a335m were recognised on contract assets during the year (FY23: \u00a346m).\n\nThe expected credit loss provisions recognised against contract assets vary across the group due to the nature of our customers; the expected loss rate at 31 March 2024 was 3% (FY23: 3%).",

Specific items\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, impairment of goodwill, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, historical property-related provisions, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nMovements relating to the sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), such as fair value gains or losses on the A and C preference shares or impairment charges on the equity-accounted investment are classified as specific.

These items represent movements in provisions relating to various matters.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\nWe have incurred charges of \u00a3388m (FY23: \u00a3300m) relating to projects associated with our group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme. Costs primarily relate to leaver costs, consultancy costs, and staff costs associated with colleagues working exclusively on programme activity. The net cash cost of restructuring activity during the year was \u00a3348m (FY23: \u00a3326m).\n\nThe programme was first announced in May 2020 and runs until the end of FY25. In response to cost inflation, during FY23 we revised the gross annualised savings target to \u00a33.0bn (previously \u00a32.5bn), with a cost to achieve of \u00a31.6bn (previously \u00a31.3bn). We have now achieved our \u00a33bn target 12 months early at a cost to achieve of \u00a31.5bn, \u00a30.1bn lower than target (FY23: achieved gross annualised savings of \u00a32.1bn and costs of \u00a31.1bn).The cumulative cash costs incurred amount to \u00a31.5bn (FY23: \u00a31.1bn).\n\n## BT Sport disposal\n\nIn the prior year, we completed the disposal of BT Sport operations through forming the Sports JV with WBD. We recognised a profit on disposal of \u00a328m in specific items, made up of \u00a3155m charges recognised within operating costs net of \u00a3183m tax credits. We also recognised a \u00a313m credit within finance costs as specific, relating to a foreign exchange hedging arrangement with the Sports JV.\n\n## Sports JV subsequent movements\n\nSubsequent to the BT Sport disposal, we have recorded a net fair value loss of \u00a322m (FY23: \u00a334m) on the A and C preference shares held in the Sports JV (see note 24), and \u00a310m additional net costs relating to the transaction.\n\n## Other divestment-related items\n\nWe recognised a \u00a322m credit (FY23: \u00a32m charge) comprising a net \u00a325m gain on disposal from the completed divestments of Pelipod Limited, BT Enia S.p.A and certain city fibre networks and associated infrastructure assets in Germany; offset by \u00a33m charges relating to ongoing divestment activity.\n\n## Historical property-related provisions\n\nDuring FY24 we recognised a provision of \u00a334m as a specific item (FY23: nil) in relation to the cost of remediating and rectifying asbestos related property issues where we have a present obligation to do this.\n\n## Impairment charges due to property rationalisation\n\nDuring FY24, we recognised a \u00a311m impairment charge as specific (FY23: \u00a365m), in relation to an ongoing property rationalisation programme.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill\n\nWe have recognised an impairment charge of \u00a3488m (FY23: nil) in respect of goodwill allocated to our Business cash generating unit. See note 13 for more details.\n\n## Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation\n\nDuring the year we incurred \u00a3121m (FY23: \u00a318m) of interest costs in relation to our defined benefit pension obligations.\n\n## Tax on specific items\n\nA tax credit of \u00a3145m was recognised in relation to specific items (FY23: \u00a3308m, of which \u00a3183m relates to the BT Sport disposal).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 10. Taxation\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to taxation\n\nCurrent income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income. We evaluate positions taken in tax returns where tax regulation is subject to interpretation, and establish provisions if appropriate based on the amounts likely to be paid to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred and current income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for taxation\n\nWe seek to pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business. However, in some areas these laws are unclear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation. We estimate our tax on countryby-country and issue-by-issue bases. Our key uncertainties are whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes. We provide for the predicted outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates. Approximately 65% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months. \u00a3112m (FY23: \u00a3104m) is included in current tax liabilities or offset against current tax assets where netting is appropriate.\n\nWe are subject to regular tax authority review, under a downside case an additional amount of \u00a3123m could be required to be paid. This amount is not provided as we don't consider this outcome to be probable.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental. We only recognise them when we consider it is probable that they can be recovered. In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.\n\nThe value of the group's income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the group balance sheet. The value of the group's deferred tax assets and liabilities is disclosed below.\n\n## Analysis of our taxation expense for the year\n\n| Year ended 31 March                               | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| United Kingdom                                    |           |           |\n| Corporation tax at 25% (FY23: 19%)                | (10)      | -         |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years           | -         | 63        |\n| Non-UK taxation                                   |           |           |\n| Current                                           | (77)      | (67)      |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years           | (10)      | 9         |\n| Total current taxation (expense)                  | (97)      | 5         |\n| Deferred taxation                                 |           |           |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences | (280)     | 102       |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years           | 46        | 56        |\n| Remeasurement of temporary differences            | -         | 13        |\n| Total deferred taxation credit (expense)          | (234)     | 171       |\n| Total taxation (expense)                          | (331)     | 176       |",

These deductions drive a projected UK tax loss and no UK tax payments for FY24. The enhanced and accelerated tax deductions arising under the Government's super-deduction regime for qualifying capital spend during FY22 and FY23, together with full expensing in FY24 and pension deficit contribution deductions,  result in c. \u00a311.3bn of tax losses expected to be carried forward from FY24, to be utilised against future UK taxable profits. These are represented by a net c. \u00a32.8bn deferred tax asset which is disclosed within the \u00a32,911m deferred tax asset relating to tax losses in the table above.\n\nThe group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. The UK has enacted Pillar Two legislation which applies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective for the current period, the group has no related current tax exposure. Under the legislation, the group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. As the UK rate of corporation tax from FY24 will be 25%, and the group's business is primarily in the UK, the impact of these rules on the group is not expected to be material.\n\n## What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?\n\nAt 31 March 2024 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a33.7bn (FY23: \u00a33.7bn). Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below:\n\n| At 31 March 2024              | \u00a3m    | Expiry      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Restricted losses             |       |             |\n| Europe                        | -     | 2025 - 2043 |\n| Americas                      | 372   | 2025 - 2033 |\n| Other                         | 2     | 2025 - 2033 |\n| Total restricted losses       | 374   |             |\n| Unrestricted operating losses | 3,080 | No expiry   |\n| Other temporary differences   | 209   | No expiry   |\n| Total                         | 3,663 |             |\n\nAt 31 March 2024 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a316.8bn (FY23: \u00a316.8bn).

No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise. Under current tax rules, tax of \u00a344m (FY23: \u00a341m) would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.\n\n## 11. Earnings per share\n\n## How is earnings per share calculated?\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                  | 2024   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic weighted average number of shares (millions)   | 9,823  | 9,803  |\n| Dilutive shares from share options (millions)        | 39     | 83     |\n| Dilutive shares from share awards (millions)         | 136    | 171    |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) | 9,998  | 10,057 |\n| Basic earnings per share                             | 8.7 p  | 19.4 p |\n| Diluted earnings per share                           | 8.6 p  | 18.9 p |\n\nThe earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests. Profit after tax was \u00a3855m (FY23: \u00a31,905m) and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was \u00a3nil (FY23: \u00a34m). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.\n\n## 12. Dividends\n\n## What is the group's dividend policy?\n\nWe have a progressive dividend policy to maintain or grow the dividend each year whilst taking into consideration a number of factors including underlying medium-term earnings expectations and levels of business reinvestment.\n\n## What dividends have been paid?\n\nA final dividend of 5.69p per share amounting to approximately \u00a3553m is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2024 (FY23: final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to \u00a3530m paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023). An interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3227m was paid on 2 February 2024 (FY23: interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3226m paid). This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.\n\n|                                                 | 2024            | 2024   | 2023            | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|--------|\n| Year ended 31 March                             | pence per share | \u00a3m     | pence per share | \u00a3m     |\n| Final dividend in respect of the prior year     | 5.39            | 530    | 5.39            | 527    |\n| Interim dividend in respect of the current year | 2.31            | 227    | 2.31            | 226    |\n|                                                 | 7.70            | 757    | 7.70            | 753    |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 13. Intangible assets\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to intangible assets\n\nWe recognise identifiable intangible assets where we control the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the group, and we can reliably measure the cost of the asset. We amortise all intangible assets, other than goodwill, over their useful economic life. The method of amortisation reflects the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method is used.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) of the acquired business. Our goodwill impairment policy is set out later in this note.\n\n## Acquired intangible assets - customer relationships and brands\n\nIntangible assets such as customer relationships or brands acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of these relationships or brands and include management's estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by them.\n\n## Telecommunications licences\n\nLicence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period or where our usage can extend beyond the initial licence period, over the period we expect to benefit from the use of the licences, which is typically 20 years. Licences acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. The fair value is based on management's assumption of future cash flows using market expectations at acquisition date.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software comprises computer software licences purchased from third parties, and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost. We capitalise costs directly associated with the production of internally developed software, including direct and indirect labour costs of development, only where it is probable that the software will generate future economic benefits, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs which do not meet these criteria and research costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nOur development costs which give rise to internally developed software include upgrading the network architecture or functionality and developing service platforms aimed at offering new services to our customers.\n\n## Other\n\nOther intangible assets include website development costs and other licences. Items are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life or the term of the contract.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful economic lives assigned to the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- - Computer software\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- - Telecommunications licences\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n- - Customer relationships and brands\n\n1 to 15 years\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash generating unit and the fair value less costs to dispose.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as described below. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, as a specific item. If a cash generating unit is impaired, impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro-rata basis against intangible and other assets.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Impairment of goodwill\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to impairment of goodwill\n\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment review.\n\nGoodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit (CGU) level. These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer and Business.\n\nWe allocate goodwill to each of the CGUs that we expect to benefit from the business combination. Each CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe value in use of each CGU is determined using risk-adjusted cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period. They reflect management's risk-adjusted expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance. Cash flows beyond the fifth year have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates made in reviewing goodwill for impairment\n\n## Determining our CGUs\n\nThe determination of our CGUs is judgemental. The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows. This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams.\n\nIn FY23 our CGUs were aligned with the Consumer, Enterprise and Global customer-facing units in existence at the time. From 1 April 2023 the Enterprise and Global units are managed and reported as a single combined unit, Business. Financial information is provided to the Executive Committee on a consolidated basis only, and there have been material changes to the structure and organisation of the combined Business unit following the merger.\n\nDuring FY24 we have reviewed the identification of our CGUs in light of the creation of Business. We concluded that the Enterprise and Global CGUs have been replaced with a single Business CGU. In reaching this conclusion we considered the way in which the combined unit is monitored and the degree of integration within the combined unit, specifically in relation to revenue streams and its asset base. This conclusion also reflects the fact that the cash flows of the legacy Enterprise and Global units are no longer independent and it is no longer possible to report the performance of these units on an individual basis.\n\nAccordingly, our CGUs are Consumer and Business from 1 April 2023, aligned with the corresponding CFUs and operating segments (note 4).\n\n## Estimating value in use\n\nOur value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including management's expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows and the discount rate for each CGU. Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are on a nominal basis and based on risk-adjusted projections derived from the  latest Board-approved five-year financial plans, representing management's best risk-adjusted estimate of future growth. This includes the direct and indirect impacts of inflation and associated mitigations. Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates and consideration of the overall variability relating to individual assumptions at the unit level. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\n## Estimating terminal growth\n\nA long term growth rate into perpetuity is applied immediately at the end of the five year forecast period. We calculate this for each CGU as the lower of the nominal GDP growth rate forecasts and the long-term compound annual growth rate as estimated by management. Long-term compound annual growth rates may be lower than forecast nominal GDP growth rates due to marketspecific factors including inflation expectations, the regulatory environment and competition intensity.\n\nWe tested our goodwill for impairment as at 31 March 2024. The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.",

We have therefore booked an impairment charge equivalent to this amount in the income statement, presented as a specific item (note 9). No impairment was recognised in FY23.\n\nHistorical trends including the transition from legacy products indicate risk within forecasts which we have made appropriate adjustment for in line with IAS 36, so as to arrive at a risk adjusted estimate of future economic conditions which reflects long-term viability and trading risks inherent in delivering against the group's strategic pillars.\n\nAt the same time, to acknowledge this risk we have reduced terminal growth rate applied to cash flows when calculating the terminal value. We have also excluded uncommitted restructuring costs and benefits including those that relate to the group-wide restructuring programmes. The combined impact of these adjustments has led to a value in use for IAS 36 impairment testing purposes that is indicative of an impairment. Calculating the value in use has involved the application of assumptions and estimates that have had a material impact on the impairment charge recognised. Management judge that the Board-approved forecasts used to calculate value in use support the carrying amount of the Business CGU as at 31 March 2024. We consider below the impact of reasonably possible alternatives in the next 12 months.\n\n## What discount rate have we used?\n\nThe pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the calculation of the group's weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data. The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation for Consumer was 9.25% in FY24 and 9.4% in FY23. We have used a slightly higher rate of 9.27% for Business. This reflects the higher risk countries in which it operates, which in FY23 were part of the Global CGU. In FY23 we used a discount rate of 9.4% for Enterprise and 9.7% for Global, again reflecting the higher risk from countries in which it operates. The reduction in discount rates in FY24 reflects that the cash flows, rather than the discount rate, have been risk adjusted.\n\n## What growth rates have we used?\n\nThe perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets and analysts' expectations. None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected average long-term growth rates for those markets or sectors. In FY24 we have used a perpetuity growth rate of 1.0% for Consumer and 0.7% for the Business CGU. In FY23 the perpetuity growth rate was 2.0% for Enterprise and Consumer, and 2.4% for Global.\n\n## Key assumptions applied to testing goodwill allocated to the Business CGU\n\nKey assumptions that value in use is most sensitive to are EBITDA growth over the 5-year forecast period; the long term growth rate for the terminal period; and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flows.\n\n- - Our value in use assumes risk-adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth of 0.7% over the 5-year forecast period. The growth rate is the projected adjusted EBITDA growth rate on the cash flow forecasts used in our goodwill impairment model and reflect the growth and maturity of the industry we operate in and historical trends. Compound annual growth rates are risk-adjusted to  the compound annual growth rates used in our Board-approved forecasts.\n- - Application of the terminal growth rate of 0.7%, equivalent to compound annual growth within the terminal period, is viewed as a key assumption with c.75% of the value in use derived from terminal cash flows.\n- - Value in use is sensitive to the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the \u00a3488m impairment recognised to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions:\n\n|                                           | Low scenario              | High scenario         |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| EBITDA compound annual growth rate +/- 1% | (\u00a31,260m) more impairment | \u00a3374m less impairment |\n| Long term growth rate +/- 0.7%            | (\u00a3478m) more impairment   | \u00a3488m less impairment |\n| Weighted average cost of capital +/- 1%   | (\u00a3865m) more impairment   | \u00a3488m less impairment |",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Other sensitivities applicable to the Business CGU\n\nApplying a severe but plausible downside scenario, reflecting a plan that we are highly confident will be achieved or exceeded, based on the same risk population would result in a further impairment charge of \u00a32,430m in addition to the \u00a3488m recognised. Management consider that it is reasonably possible to expect that actual future cash flows will outperform the risk-adjusted cash flows modelled for the purpose of testing goodwill impairment. A less conservative view of risks and opportunities in the base case of our forecast would result in headroom of approximately \u00a32,083m rather than the impairment charge booked.\n\n## 14. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to property, plant and equipment\n\nOur property, plant and equipment is included at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation, government grants and any impairment charges. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations is initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for on the same basis as our existing assets. We derecognise items of property, plant and equipment on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the date of disposal is recognised in operating costs in the income statement.\n\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure and equipment are direct and indirect labour costs, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available for use, to write off the asset's cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\n- - Freehold buildings\n\n14 to 50 years\n\n- - Short-term\u00a0leasehold\u00a0improvements\n\nShorter of 10 years or lease term\n\n- - Leasehold land and buildings\n\nShorter of unexpired portion of lease or 40\u00a0years\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nTransmission equipment\n\n- - Duct\n\n40 years\n\n- - Cable\n\n3 to 25 years\n\n- - Fibre\n\n5 to 20 years\n\nExchange equipment\n\n2 to 13 years\n\nOther network equipment\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n## Other assets\n\n- - Motor vehicles\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- - Computers\u00a0and\u00a0office\u00a0equipment\n\n3 to 7 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are recognised prospectively.\n\n## Network share assets\n\nCertain assets have been contributed to a network share arrangement by both EE and Hutchison 3G UK Limited, with legal title remaining with the contributor. This is considered to be a reciprocal arrangement. Our share of the assets on acquisition of EE was recognised at fair value within tangible assets, and depreciated in line with policy. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\nWe test property, plant and equipment for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, we assess the recoverable amount by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant asset and the fair value less costs to dispose. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for the individual asset then we assess impairment by reference to the relevant cash generating unit as described in note 13.",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Building Digital UK (BDUK) government grants\n\nWe receive government grants in relation to BDUK and other rural superfast broadband contracts. Where we have achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, we have an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding. Where this is the case, we recognise deferred income in respect of the funding that will be re-invested or repaid, and make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment.\n\nAssessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable. Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long-term take-up trend.\n\nOur assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up. The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 17.\n\n|                                    | Land and buildings   | Held by  Openreach   | Held by other units   | Other a   | Assets under construction   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|---------|\n|                                    | \u00a3m                   | \u00a3m                   | \u00a3m                    | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m                          | \u00a3m      |\n| Cost                               |                      |                      |                       |           |                             |         |\n| At 1 April 2022                    | 1,022                | 31,276               | 24,439                | 1,444     | 1,446                       | 59,627  |\n| Additions b                        | 7                    | -

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\nIncluded within the disclosure are assets used in arrangements which represent core business activities for the group and which meet the definition of operating leases:\n\n- - \u00a315,699m (FY23: \u00a314,777m) of the carrying amount of the network infrastructure asset class represents Openreach's network infrastructure. The majority of the associated assets are used to deliver fixed-line telecommunications services that have been assessed as containing operating leases, to both internal and external communications providers. Network infrastructure held by Openreach is presented separately in the table above; however it is not practicable to separate out infrastructure not used in operating lease arrangements.\n- - Other assets includes devices with a carrying amount of \u00a3160m (FY23: \u00a3163m) that are made available to retail customers under arrangements that contain operating leases. These are not presented separately in the table above as they are not material relative to the group's overall asset base.\n\nThe carrying amount of land and buildings, including leasehold improvements, comprised:\n\n| At 31 March              |   2024 \u00a3m |   2023 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Freehold                 |        71 |        80 |\n| Leasehold                |       347 |       369 |\n| Total land and buildings |       418 |       449 |\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nSome of our network assets are jointly controlled by EE Limited with Hutchison 3G UK Limited. These relate to shared 3G network and certain elements of network for 4G rural sites. The net book value of the group's share of assets controlled by its joint operation MBNL is \u00a3759m (FY23: \u00a3721m) and is recorded within network infrastructure.\n\nWithin network infrastructure are assets with a net book value of \u00a311.5bn (FY23: \u00a310.9bn) which have useful economic lives of more than 18 years.\n\n## BT Tower\n\nIn FY24 we agreed to the sale of the BT Tower for headline consideration of \u00a3275m, as part of the simplification of the group's property portfolio.\n\nThe carrying amount of the BT Tower asset is \u00a34m at 31 March 2024. It is not considered to meet the IFRS 5 criteria for classification as held for sale at the reporting date, reflecting the extent of decommissioning work needed to provide vacant possession of the site.\n\nThe useful economic lives of assets associated with the BT Tower have been reassessed in light of the anticipated disposal in FY30.\n\n## Significant judgements made in accounting for the BT Tower sale\n\nExchange of contracts in respect of the BT Tower sale with MCR Hotels occurred during FY24, with transfer of legal title anticipated to take place in a three year window between 2028 and 2031 subject to achieving vacant possession of the site. We will continue to enjoy exclusive rights to occupy and access the site prior to completion. The delay between exchange and completion reflects the extensive work required to decommission the site.\n\nWe have exercised significant judgement in concluding that control over BT Tower passes to the buyer at the point of completion rather than exchange. In doing so we performed a detailed assessment of the restrictions placed on BT's use of the asset in the period following exchange, as well as the transaction pricing structure, and concluded that they were insufficient to represent a transfer to the buyer of sufficiently all the risks and rewards associated with ownership. We placed particular weight on the fact that legal title to the site does not transfer to the buyer until the point of completion. Had we concluded that control had passed on exchange of contracts in FY24, the transaction would have been treated as a sale and leaseback with profit on disposal recognised in the period and associated derecognition of the BT Tower asset and accounting for the leaseback.\n\n## Low carbon fleet\n\nAs reported in our TCFD statement on page 78, we're working hard and investing to convert the majority of our fleet to electric or zero emission vehicles by the end of FY31. This plan does not trigger a significant impairment of fleet assets as substantially all non-electric vehicles held by the group at 31 March 2024 will be fully depreciated ahead of FY31.",

Leases\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to leases\n\n## Identifying whether a lease exists\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A lease exists if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for consideration. In making this assessment, we consider whether:\n\n- - The contract involves the use of an identified asset, either explicitly or implicitly. The asset must be physically distinct or represent substantially all the capacity of a physically distinct asset. Assets that a supplier has a substantive right to substitute are not considered distinct.\n- - The lessee (either the group, or the group's customers) has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n- - The lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset, in other words, has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nWhere practicable, and by class of underlying asset, we have elected to account for leases containing a lease component and one or more non-lease components as a single lease component. Where this election has been taken, it has been applied to the entire asset.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nWe recognise a lease liability and right-of-use asset at the commencement of the lease.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are due over the lease term, discounted using the group's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for the impact of any extension options that we are reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise, or termination options that we are reasonably certain that the lessee will not exercise.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is the rate that we would have to pay for a loan of a similar term, and with similar security, to obtain an asset of similar value.\n\nLease payments include:\n\n- - fixed payments\n- - variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate\n- - amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees\n- - the exercise price of any purchase options that we are reasonably certain to exercise\n- - payments due over optional renewal periods where we are reasonably certain to renew\n- - penalties for early termination of the lease where we are reasonably certain to terminate early\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments, including changes in the index or rate used to determine those payments, or the amount we expect to be payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWe also remeasure lease liabilities where the lease term changes. This occurs when the non-cancellable period of the lease changes, or on occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances within the control of the lessee and which changes our initial assessment in regard to whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options. Where the lease term changes we remeasure the lease liability using the group's incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment. Where a significant event or change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term remains unchanged and the carrying amounts of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset will decline over time.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at the initial amount of the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepaid lease payments, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any decommissioning costs that have been recognised as provisions, less any lease incentives received. They are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment following the policy set out in note 14 and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nWe have elected not to recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases of low-value assets with a purchase price under \u00a35,000. We recognise  payments for these items as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAny variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as usage-based payments, are recognised as an expense in the period to which the variability relates.",

Leases continued\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nWhen we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, we make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, we consider certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen we are an intermediate lessor, we account for our interests in the headlease and the sublease separately. We assess the lease classification of a sublease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the headlease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a headlease is a short-term lease to which we apply the exemption described above, then we classify the sublease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then we apply IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nWe apply the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. We further regularly review estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nWe recognise lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'other revenue'.\n\n## Significant judgements made in accounting for leases\n\nThe lease term is a key determinant of the size of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised where the group acts as lessee; and the deferral period for any upfront connection charges where the group acts as lessor. Determining the lease term requires judgement to evaluate whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options. Key facts and circumstances that create an incentive to exercise those options are considered; these include:\n\n- - Our anticipated operational, retail and office property requirements in the mid and long term.\n- - The availability of suitable alternative sites.\n- - Costs or penalties associated with exiting lease arrangements relative to the benefits to be gained, including costs of removing leasehold improvements or relocating, and indirect costs such as disruption to business.\n- - Significant investments in leased sites, in particular those with useful lives beyond the lease term.\n- - Costs associated with extending lease arrangements including rent increases during secondary lease periods.\n\nOur definition of 'reasonable certainty', and therefore the lease term, will often align with the judgements made in our medium-term plan, in particular for leases of non-specialised property and equipment on rolling (or 'evergreen') arrangements that continue until terminated and which can be exited without significant penalty.\n\nFollowing initial determination of the lease term, we exercise judgement in evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances are sufficiently significant to change the initial assessment of whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options; and in the subsequent reassessment of the lease term.\n\n## Key judgements exercised in setting the lease term\n\nThe quantum of the lease liability and right-of-use asset currently recognised on our balance sheet is most significantly affected by the judgement exercised in setting the lease term for the arrangement under which the bulk of our operational UK property estate is held. Setting the lease term for our leased cell sites has also involved the use of judgement, albeit to a lesser degree.",

Leases continued\n\n## UK operational property portfolio\n\nSubstantially all of our leased property estate is held under an arrangement which can be terminated in 2031, at which point we may either vacate some or all properties or purchase the entire estate. If neither option is taken the lease continues to the next unilaterally available break point in 2041. The lease liability recognised for the arrangement reflects a lease end date of 2031.\n\nOn initial recognition we concluded that, although the majority of these properties are expected to be needed on a long-term basis, we couldn't be reasonably certain that we wouldn't exercise the termination option or that we would exercise the purchase option. In coming to this conclusion, we had due regard to material sub-lease arrangements relating to the estate.\n\nAs time progresses our assessment may change; if this happens, we will remeasure the lease liability and right-of-use asset to reflect either the rentals due for any properties we will continue to occupy, or the cost of purchasing the estate, using an updated discount rate. There would be no overall impact on net assets.\n\nIf the assessment were to change at the balance sheet date of 31 March 2024:\n\n- - Exercising the purchase option would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn.\n- - Continuing to lease the estate beyond 2031 until the next available break in 2041 would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn.\n\nOur assessment will be directly linked to future strategic decisions, which will be resolved at some time prior to 2031, around the development of the fixed network and the associated rationalisation of our exchange estate. The breadth of the ranges reflects the significant uncertainty around key variables used to determine cash outflows, especially future inflation and which properties the group will be able to exit prior to or in 2031.\n\nEstimates are based on discounted cash outflows and do not reflect the likely and significant impact of cash inflows generated from the disposal, repurposing or subleasing of properties retained post-2031.\n\nWe are permitted to hand a limited number of properties back to the lessor prior to 2031. On initial adoption of IFRS 16 we were not reasonably certain which properties would be handed back and as such the lease term did not reflect the exercise of these options. Subsequently we exercise judgement in identifying significant events that trigger reassessment of our initial conclusion. We exercise similar judgement in identifying events triggering reassessment of whether we are reasonably certain we will not exercise termination options associated with other leased properties.\n\nIn doing so we consider decisions associated with our ongoing workplace rationalisation programme, in particular decisions to exit a particular location or lease an alternative property. Generally we remain reasonably certain that we will not exercise a termination option until implementation of the associated business plan has progressed to a stage that we are committed to exiting the property. At that point we reassess the lease term by reference to the time we expect to remain in occupation of the property and any notice period associated with exercise of the option.\n\n## Cell sites\n\nMost of the liability recognised in respect of leased cell sites relates to multi-site arrangements with commercial providers. The fixed-term nature of these arrangements means it has not been necessary to exercise significant judgement when determining the lease term. Where the arrangements offer extension options we have been required to conclude whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Although the balance sheet could be materially affected by the conclusion reached in regard to these options, we have not been required to exercise a significant degree of judgement in arriving at the lease term having regard to the period of time covered by the options, the difficulty in predicting the group's long-term network requirements, and the relatively high threshold that 'reasonably certain' represents.\n\nA smaller proportion of the cell site liability relates to arrangements with individual landlords which are either rolling or can be exited with notice. When setting the initial lease term for these arrangements we exercised significant judgement in establishing the period that we are reasonably certain to require use of the site. We broadly aligned lease terms with our medium-term planning horizon after assessing the relative strengths of the following factors:\n\n- - Long-term economic incentives to remain on sites including existing capital improvements;\n- - A need to maintain flexibility in our ability to develop and manage our network infrastructure to react quickly to technological developments and evolving capacity requirements; and\n- - Incentives to renegotiate arrangements in the medium term to gain more security over sites to support future capital investment.\n\nAlthough significant judgement has been exercised in determining the lease term, reaching an alternative conclusion would not have a material impact on the balance sheet having regard to the most feasible alternative lease terms.\n\nSubsequently, we consider key events that trigger reassessment of lease terms to be developments which resolve uncertainty around our economic incentive to remain on individual sites in the long term. These are primarily lease renegotiations and significant capital investments, for example that associated with our 5G rollout and other capital refresh programmes.",

Trade and other receivables\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to trade and other receivables\n\nTrade receivables are recognised where the right to receive payment from customers is conditional only on the passage of time. We initially recognise trade and other receivables at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts receivable.\n\nWe provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers. Because of this, we recognise an allowance for doubtful debts on initial recognition of receivables, which is deducted from the gross carrying amount of the receivable. The allowance is calculated by reference to credit losses expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. In estimating a loss allowance we consider historical experience and informed credit assessment alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues. We consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.\n\nOnce recognised, trade receivables are continuously monitored and updated. Allowances are based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged category as well as forward-looking information and general economic conditions. Allowances are calculated by individual CFUs in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that CFU.\n\nThe group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. Trade receivables that are subject to debt factoring arrangements are derecognised if they meet the conditions for derecognition detailed in IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' and the related cash flows received are presented as cash flows from operating activities.\n\nContingent assets such as any insurance recoveries which we expect to recoup, have not been recognised in the financial statements as these are only recognised within trade and other receivables when their receipt is virtually certain.",

Trade and other receivables continued\n\n## Deferred contract costs\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to deferred contract costs\n\nWe capitalise certain costs associated with the acquisition and fulfilment of contracts with customers and amortise them over the period that we transfer the associated services.\n\nConnection costs are deferred as contract fulfilment costs because they allow satisfaction of the associated connection performance obligation and are considered recoverable. Sales commissions and other third party contract acquisition costs are capitalised as costs to acquire a contract unless the associated contract term is less than 12 months, in which case they are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. A portfolio approach is used to determine contract term.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contractual arrangements represent distinct performance obligations, costs in delivering these services are expensed as incurred. Where these services are not distinct performance obligations, we capitalise eligible costs as a cost of fulfilling the related service. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, unless the pattern of service delivery indicates a more appropriate profile. To be eligible for capitalisation, costs must be directly attributable to specific contracts, relate to future activity, and generate future economic benefits. Capitalised costs are regularly assessed for recoverability.\n\nThe following table shows the movement on deferred costs:\n\n|                  | Deferred connection  costs \u00a3m   | Deferred contract  acquisition costs -  commissions \u00a3m   | Deferred contract  acquisition costs -  dealer incentives \u00a3m   | Transition and  transformation \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2022  | 24                              | 124                                                      | 324                                                            | 90                                  | 562        |\n| Additions        | 15                              | 100                                                      | 285                                                            | 70                                  | 470        |\n| Amortisation     | (15)                            | (94)                                                     | (276)                                                          | (67)                                | (452)      |\n| Impairment       | -                               | (1)                                                      | (1)                                                            | -                                   | (2)        |\n| Other            | (2)                             | 2                                                        | (2)                                                            | 4                                   | 2          |\n| At 31 March 2023 | 22                              | 131                                                      | 330                                                            | 97                                  | 580        |\n| Additions        | 10                              | 134                                                      | 315                                                            | 57                                  | 516        |\n| Amortisation     | (11)                            | (118)                                                    | (292)                                                          | (56)                                | (477)      |\n| Impairment       | -                               | (2)                                                      | (7)                                                            | -                                   | (9)        |\n| Other            | (8)                             | 2                                                        | 3                                                              | 5                                   | 2          |\n| At 31 March 2024 | 13                              | 147                                                      | 349                                                            | 103                                 | 612        |",

We subsequently carry them at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nWe use a supply chain financing programme to extend payment terms with a limited number of suppliers to a more typical payment term. We also use a separate supply chain financing programme to allow suppliers to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date. We assess these arrangements against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing schemes continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings. At 31 March 2024 under the terms of the arrangement the funder's payment to the supplier does not legally extinguish our obligation to the supplier so it remains within trade and other payables. Cash flows only occur when the trade payable is extinguished and are therefore presented in cash flows from operating activities.\n\n| At 31 March                                   | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current                                       |           |           |\n| Trade payables                                | 4,119     | 4,196     |\n| Other taxation and social security            | 544       | 581       |\n| Minimum guarantee with sports joint venture a | 194       | 195       |\n| Accrued expenses                              | 543       | 458       |\n| Deferred income b                             | 355       | 532       |\n| Other payables c                              | 572       | 602       |\n|                                               | 6,327     | 6,564     |\n| Non-current                                   |           |           |\n| Minimum guarantee with sports joint venture a | 271       | 465       |\n| Deferred income b                             | 342       | 403       |\n| Other payables                                | 24        | 52        |\n|                                               | 637       | 920       |\n\n- a Liability recognised on the minimum revenue guarantee in BT's distribution agreement with the sports joint venture (see note 22).

        "page_content": "## 18. Provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nOur provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, third party claims, litigation and regulatory risks. Contingent liabilities primarily arise from litigation and regulatory matters that are not sufficiently certain to meet the criteria for recognition as provisions.\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nWe recognise provisions when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\n\nWhere these criteria are not met we disclose a contingent liability if the group has a possible obligation, or has a present obligation with an outflow that is not probable or which cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a nominal pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Cash flows are adjusted for the effect of inflation where appropriate.\n\n## Significant judgements made in identifying contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet. By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes where this can be reasonably determined.\n\nIn identifying contingent liabilities we make key judgements in relation to applicable law and any historical and pending court rulings, and the likelihood, timing and cost of resolution.\n\nEstablishing contingent liabilities associated with litigation brought against the group may involve the use of significant judgements and assumptions, in particular around the ability to form a reliable estimate of any probable outflow. We provide further information in relation to specific matters in the 'contingent liabilities' section below.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for provisions\n\nWe exercise judgement in determining the quantum of all provisions to be recognised. Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nWhen measuring provisions we reflect the impact of inflation as appropriate, particularly in relation to our property, asset retirement obligation and third party claims provisions. Although this involves a degree of estimation, it does not represent a significant source of estimation uncertainty having regard to the quantum of the balances in question and the anticipated timing of outflows.\n\nProperty provisions relate to obligations arising in relation to our property portfolio, in particular costs to restore leased properties on vacation where this is required under the lease agreement. In measuring property provisions, we have made estimates of the costs associated with the restoration of properties by reference to any relevant guidance such as rate cards. Cash outflows occur as and when properties are vacated and the obligations are settled.\n\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to obligations to dismantle equipment and restore network sites on vacation of the site. The provision represents the group's best estimate of the costs to dismantle equipment and restore the sites. Obligations are settled as and when sites are vacated and the timing is largely influenced by the group's network strategy.\n\nOur regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters. The charge/credit for the year represents the outcome of management's re-assessment of the estimates and regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues. The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators. When estimating the likely value of regulatory risk we make key judgements, including in regard to interpreting Ofcom regulations and past and current claims. The precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory and compliance decisions will result in financial settlement. The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\nLitigation provisions represent the best estimate to settle present obligations recognised in respect of claims brought against the group. The estimate reflects the specific facts and circumstances of each individual matter and any relevant external advice received. Provisions recognised are inherently judgemental and could change over time as matters progress.\n\nThird party claims provisions (previously described as insurance provisions) represent our exposure to claims from third parties, with latent disease claims from former colleagues and motor vehicle claims making up the majority of the balance. We engage an independent actuary to provide an estimate of the most likely outcomes in respect of latent disease and third party motor vehicle accident claims, and our in-house insurance teams review our exposure to other risks.\n\nOther provisions do not include any individually material provisions.\n\nFor all risks, the ultimate liability may vary materially from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.",

We have disclosed below a number of such matters including any matters where we believe a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group is possible and the likelihood of a material outflow of resources is more than remote.\n\nWhere the outflow of resources is considered probable, and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts and reflected in the table above. Where an outflow is not probable but is possible, or a reasonable estimate of the obligation cannot be made, a contingent liability exists.\n\nIn respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group. There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and/or the often slow pace of litigation.\n\n## Class action claim - landline only services\n\nIn January 2021, Justin Le Patourel, represented by law firm Mishcon de Reya applied to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring a proposed class action claim for damages they estimated at \u00a3608m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a3589m (inclusive of simple interest) alleging anti-competitive behaviour through excessive pricing by BT to customers with certain residential landline services. Ofcom considered this topic in 2017. At that time, Ofcom's final statement made no finding of excessive pricing or breach of competition law more generally but we implemented a voluntary commitment to reduce prices for customers that have a BT landline only and not to increase those prices beyond inflation (CPI). In September 2021 the Competition Appeal Tribunal certified the claim to proceed to a substantive trial on an opt-out basis (class members are automatically included in the claim unless they choose to opt-out). In July 2023 Justin Le Patourel amended his claim seeking increased damages estimated at \u00a31,338m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a31,309m (inclusive of simple interest), later revised to \u00a31,307m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a31,278m (inclusive of simple interest). A hearing took place between January and March 2024 and we are awaiting judgment. At the reporting date we are not aware of any evidence to indicate that a present obligation exists such that any amount should be provided for.\n\n## Class action claim - combined mobile and handset services\n\nIn November 2023, Justin Gutmann, represented by law firm Charles Lyndon applied to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring a proposed class action claim for damages estimated at \u00a31.1bn (inclusive of simple interest) on behalf of customers who purchased combined handset and airtime contracts who are outside their minimum contract terms but who continue to pay the same price as during their minimum contract terms. The claim alleges this approach was an anti-competitive abuse of a dominant position. Similar claims have also been brought against Vodafone, Three and O2 with the total damages claimed \u00a33.285bn (inclusive of simple interest). At the reporting date we are not aware of any evidence to indicate that a present obligation exists such that any amount should be provided for. Class actions must be certified by the Competition Appeal Tribunal at a Collective Proceedings Order (CPO) hearing before proceeding to a substantive trial. A first case management conference to determine next procedural steps is scheduled for 23 May 2024. If the class action is certified the substantive trial will not conclude during FY25. BT intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\n## Italian business\n\nMilan Public Prosecutor prosecutions: In FY20 proceedings were initiated against BT Italia for certain potential offences, namely the charge of having adopted, from 2011 to 2016, an inadequate management and control organisation model for the purposes of Articles 5 and 25 of Legislative Decree 231/2001. BT Italia disputed this and maintained in a defence brief filed in April 2019 that: (a) BT Italia did not gain any interest or benefit from the conduct in question; and (b) in any event, it had a sufficient organisational, management and",

The trial commenced on 26 January 2021. On 23 April 2021, the Court allowed some parties to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties ('parte civile') - a procedural feature of the Italian criminal law system. These claims were directed at certain individual defendants (which include former BT/ BT Italia employees). Those parties successfully joined BT Italia as a respondent to their civil claims ('responsabile civile') on the basis that it is vicariously responsible for the individuals' wrongdoing.\n\nThe first instance phase of the trial has now concluded with the Court handing down its decision on 25 January 2024. The Court convicted certain individuals (including certain former BT Italia employees) for manipulation of BT Italia's financial statements for the financial year ending 31 March 2016 and for fraud against an Italian company, Sed Multitel S.r.l. The Court dismissed all charges that had been brought against BT Italia but ordered that BT Italia indemnify certain individual minority shareholders in the company and Sed Multitel for their losses. The Court has not quantified the indemnification amount, such that the indemnified parties must now seek to recover these amounts from BT Italia by agreement or separate civil proceedings. The quantum of those claims, if they are pursued successfully, is not anticipated to be material.\n\nAccounting misstatement claims: a law firm acting on behalf of a group of investors has made claims under s.90A of the Financial Services & Markets Act 2000, alleging that untrue or misleading statements were made in relation to the historical irregular accounting practices in BT's Italian business (which have been the subject of previous disclosures). No value is stated and the matter is in the early stages. As mentioned in our earlier reports, the accounting issues in Italy have previously been the subject of class actions in the US that were dismissed by the US courts.\n\n## Phones 4U\n\nSince 2015 the administrators of Phones 4U Limited have made allegations that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure Phones 4U's insolvency. Legal proceedings for an unquantified amount were issued in December 2018 by the administrators. The trial on the question of liability/breach ran from May to July 2022. In November 2023 the High Court dismissed Phones 4U's claim in its entirety. Phones 4U has subsequently appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal and a hearing is expected in May 2025. We continue to dispute these allegations vigorously.\n\n## UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation\n\nOn 12 July 2022 the CMA opened a competition law investigation into BT and other companies involved in the purchase of freelance services for the production and broadcasting of sports content in the UK. The investigation is focused on BT Sport. In February 2023, the CMA extended its investigation to include suspected breaches of competition law in relation to the employment of staff supporting the production and broadcasting of sports content in the UK however in March 2024 the CMA confirmed this limb of its investigation would not be progressed. The CMA has said no assumption should be made at this stage that competition law has been infringed. BT is cooperating with the investigation.\n\n## 19. Retirement benefit plans\n\n## Background to BT Group's pension plans\n\nThe group has both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement benefit plans. The group's main plans are in the UK:\n\n- - The BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) is the largest UK Defined Benefit plan sponsored by BT Group, constituting 97% of BT Group's IAS 19 liability. It was closed to future benefit accrual in 2018 for the majority of members, and has 55,000 deferred members and 210,000 pensioners. All BTPS members receive pension benefits at retirement based on salary and years of service; some members also receive a  lump  sum  payment  at  retirement.  Increases  for  the  majority  of  benefits  are  linked  to  either  the  Retail  Price  Index  (RPI)  or  the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n- - The  EE  Pension  Scheme  (EEPS)  has  a  Defined  Benefit  section  that  was  closed  to  future  benefit  accrual  in  2014  and  a  Defined Contribution section which was closed to future accrual in July 2023. The Defined Benefit section constitutes 2% of BT Group's IAS 19 liability.\n- - The BT Retirement Saving Scheme (BTRSS) is a Defined Contribution, contract-based, plan operated by Standard Life which new UK employees join. There are around 67,000 employees currently contributing to the BTRSS.\n\nThe group also has retirement arrangements around the world in line with local markets and culture; the principal ones being in the Netherlands and Germany.\n\n## Types of retirement benefit plans\n\n## Defined Benefit (DB) plans\n\nDB plan benefits are determined by the plan rules, typically dependent on factors such as years of service and pensionable pay, but not on the value of actual contributions made by the group or members. The group is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from assets held, regular contributions and expected investment income.\n\nThe net defined benefit liability, or deficit, is the present value of all expected future benefit cash flows to be paid by each plan, calculated using the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries (also known as the Defined Benefit Obligation, DBO or liabilities) less the fair value of the plan assets. A net defined benefit asset, or surplus, occurs when the fair value of assets exceeds the liabilities.\n\n## Defined Contribution (DC) plans\n\nDC plan benefits are linked to the value of each member's fund, which is based on contributions paid and the performance of each individual's chosen investments. The group has no exposure to investment and other experience risks (including longevity).",

The Trustee's key powers include setting the investment strategy of BTPS (after consultation with BT Group) and agreeing with BT Group the actuarial assumptions to be used when assessing the BTPS funding position and the resulting contributions that will be paid.\n\nThere are nine Trustee directors, all of whom are appointed by BT Group, as illustrated below. Trustee directors are usually appointed for a three-year term but are then eligible for re-appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chair of the Trustee directors\n\n## Member nominated Trustee directors\n\n## Employer nominated Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions.\n\nAppointed by BT based on nominations by trade unions.\n\nAppointed by BT.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 19. Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## BTPS IAS 19 assets\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made when valuing the BTPS assets\n\nUnder IAS 19, plan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and include quoted and unquoted investments.\n\n## Valuation of main quoted investments\n\n- - Equities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices.\n- - Bonds that are regularly traded are valued using broker quotes, based on sale/bid prices.\n- - Exchange traded derivative contracts are valued based on closing bid prices.\n\n## Valuation of main unquoted investments\n\nA portion of unquoted investments are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable, which require more judgement. The assumptions used in valuing unquoted investments are affected by market conditions.\n\n- - Equities are valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEVC) guidelines where the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and earnings assumptions.\n- - Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer using RICS guidelines. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates.\n- - Bonds, including those issued by BT Group, that are not regularly traded are valued by an independent valuer using pricing models making assumptions for credit risk, market risk and market yield curves.\n- - Holdings in investment funds are typically valued at the Net Asset Value provided by the fund administrator or investment manager. The significant assumption used in the valuation is the Net Asset Value.\n- - Infrastructure investments are valued by an independent valuer using a model-based valuation such as a discounted cash flow approach, or at the price of recent market transactions if they represent fair value. Where a discounted cash flow model is used, the significant assumptions used in the valuation are the discount rate and the expected cash flows.\n- - Over the counter derivatives are valued by an independent valuer using cash flows discounted at market rates. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are the yield curves and cost of carry.\n- - The BTPS entered into a longevity insurance contract in 2014, and a second in August 2023. The two longevity insurance contracts are valued by discounting the fixed cash flows payable by the BTPS and the floating cash flows payable by the insurers under the contracts (projected by an actuary, consistent with the terms of the contracts). The significant assumptions used to value the assets are the discount rate (set as a margin above a risk-free rate to reflect credit and liquidity risk) and the mortality assumptions.\n\n\u00a35.7bn of unquoted investments that are formally valued periodically by the investment manager have a latest valuation that precedes the balance sheet date. These assets consist of: \u00a32.4bn non-core credit; \u00a31.0bn mature infrastructure; \u00a31.2bn private equity; \u00a30.9bn secure income assets; and \u00a30.2bn property. These valuations have been adjusted for cash movements between the previous valuation date and 31 March 2024. The valuation approach and inputs for these investments would only be approximately updated where there were indications of significant movements, for example implied by public market indicators. No such adjustment was required at 31 March 2024.\n\n## Asset-Backed Funding (ABF) arrangement\n\nThe ABF arrangement, issued to the BTPS in May 2021, has a fair value of \u00a31.2bn at 31 March 2024 (FY23: \u00a31.3bn) calculated as the present value of the future stream of payments, allowing for the probability of the BTPS becoming fully funded and therefore the payments to the BTPS ending early. It is not recognised as a pension asset when measuring the group's IAS 19 net defined benefit liability as it is a non-transferable financial instrument issued by the group.\n\n## How are the BTPS assets invested?\n\nThe Trustee regularly reviews the allocation of assets between different investment classes, taking into account current market conditions and trends. The allocations reflect the Trustee's views on a range of areas, including: i) the balance between seeking returns and incurring risk; ii) the extent to which the assets should be allocated to match movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rates, inflation and/or longevity (i.e. liability-driven investments, or LDI); iii) the extent to which the assets should provide cash flows to meet expected payments to beneficiaries; and iv) liquidity needed to meet benefit payments and collateral requirements for derivatives contracts.\n\nFinancial derivatives (e.g. swaps) are used to reduce the mismatch between movements in the liabilities and the assets from changes in interest rates, inflation, longevity, and exchange rates. This provides greater stability in the funding position, and therefore the deficit contributions that may be required from BT Group. The sensitivity chart on page 194 shows how the use of some of these derivatives adjusts outcomes for the BTPS. While the use of derivatives reduces funding risk, it increases the BTPS's liquidity requirements which is factored into the overall investment strategy. Following the impact of the September 2022 mini-budget on derivatives, the Bank of England and the Pensions Regulator issued guidance on the minimum level of collateral pension schemes should hold. At 31 March 2024 (and 31 March 2023), the BTPS held more collateral than these minimum levels.\n\nThe table below analyses the fair value of the BTPS assets by asset category, subdivided by valuations based on a quoted market price in an active market, and those that are not (such as investment funds).",

We use estimates for all of these uncertain events. Our assumptions reflect historical experience, market expectations (where relevant), actuarial advice and our judgement regarding future expectations at the balance sheet date. While assumptions are made for these events, actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower than the assumption, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed. The liabilities are the present value of the future expected benefit payments.\n\n## What are the forecast benefits payable from the BTPS?\n\nThere are c.265,000 members, and their dependants, who will be receiving benefits from the BTPS for the remainder of their lives. Members currently receiving pension benefits make up around 73% of the liabilities and 79% of the membership by number.",

If inflation is higher than the caps that apply to benefits, the assets will increase by more than the liabilities. Similarly, in a  deflationary environment, the asset values are expected to fall by more than the IAS 19 liabilities and funding liabilities  since the payments on index-linked gilts would be reduced but pensions paid by the BTPS would not necessarily fall to  fully offset the fall in asset values. |\n|                         | Hedging CPI benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                         | The BTPS primarily holds RPI inflation-linked assets and derivatives to hedge inflation-linked benefits.

The funding deficit at 30 June 2023 was \u00a33.7bn, down from \u00a38.0bn at the 2020 funding valuation following \u00a34.4bn of deficit contributions.\n\nAnnual contribution amounts remain unchanged, at \u00a3600m in each financial year until 31 March 2030, a final payment of \u00a3490m before 30 April 2030, and the \u00a3180m pa payments due under the ABF arrangement agreed at the 2020 valuation.\n\nNo payments are currently payable under the future funding commitment (see page 195).\n\nThese payments are summarised in the table below.\n\n| Year to 31 March (\u00a3m)              | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   | 2029   | 2030   | 2031   | 2032   | 2033   | 2034   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Payments from BT plc a             | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 490    | -      | -      | -      |\n| Future funding commitment payments | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Payments from ABF                  | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n| Total                              | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 670    | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n\n- a  Payments are due by 30 April each year.\n- b  \u00a310m is directly payable to the BTPS, and BT Group currently intends to pay the balance into the co-investment vehicle.\n\n## ABF\n\nUnder the ABF, \u00a3180m p.a. is paid into the BTPS until June 2033, secured on EE Limited. If the BTPS reaches full funding as calculated by the Scheme Actuary at any 30 June, the ABF payments to the BTPS will cease. BT Group received tax relief at inception of the ABF based on the original market value of \u00a31.7bn, and will receive further tax-relief if payments are made to the BTPS in excess of this amount.\n\nAssuming they are all paid, future payments from the ABF have a present value of \u00a31.3bn at 31 March 2024 (FY23: \u00a31.4bn). The fair value of the ABF is \u00a31.2bn at 31 March 2024 (FY23: \u00a31.3bn) which allows for the probability of the BTPS becoming fully funded, and the payments to the BTPS ending early.\n\nThe fair value of the ABF is included in the assets of the BTPS when assessing the funding deficit. Payments from the ABF to the BTPS are treated in the same way as coupon payments from bonds, and do not affect the funding deficit when they are paid.\n\nThe fair value of the ABF is not included in the assets of the BTPS when assessing the IAS 19 deficit in the group consolidated accounts, as it is a non-transferable asset issued by the group. Payments from the ABF to the BTPS are treated as deficit contributions, and reduce the IAS 19 deficit, when they are paid.\n\n## Co-investment vehicle\n\nA co-investment vehicle was set up in 2021 which provides BT Group with some protection against the risk of overfunding and therefore enables BT Group to provide upfront funding with greater confidence. BT Group is eligible for future refunds if some or all of the coinvestment vehicle funds are surplus to the BTPS's requirements, unless the BTPS, acting prudently but reasonably, decides to defer or reduce these payments. Assessments will be carried out over a series of dates between June 2032 and June 2041.\n\nPayments made by BT Group into the co-investment vehicle will be invested as if part of the overall BTPS investment strategy. BT Group will receive tax relief in respect of any funds paid to the BTPS from the vehicle but does not receive tax relief when payments are made to the co-investment vehicle.",

This showed a funding deficit of \u00a3218m. The group is scheduled to contribute \u00a31.7m each month until 31 July 2025 and a final payment of up to \u00a380m by 31 March 2026. \u00a331.7m (FY23: \u00a313.3m) of deficit contributions were paid by the group to the EEPS during the year.\n\nAt the triennial valuation date, the EEPS had a diversified investment strategy, investing scheme assets in: global equities (25%), property & illiquid alternatives (20%), an absolute return portfolio (24%) and a liability-driven investment portfolio (31%).\n\n## 20.

Share-based payments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to share-based payments\n\nWe operate a number of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which the group receives services from employees in consideration for equity instruments (share options and shares) of the group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group's estimate of the options or shares that will eventually vest. Fair value of share option schemes is measured using a Binomial options pricing model.\n\nService conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions which are taken into account to determine the fair value of equity instruments granted.  When an award or option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a nonvesting condition that is within the control of either counterparty, it is accounted for as a cancellation. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised in the income statement. As the requirement to save under an employee saveshare arrangement is a non-vesting condition, employee cancellations, other than through a termination of service, are treated as an accelerated vesting.\n\nNo adjustment is made to total equity for awards that lapse or are forfeited after the vesting date.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                        | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee saveshare plans                   | 13        | 21        |\n| Yourshare                                  | 13        | 12        |\n| Executive share plans:                     |           |           |\n| Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)                  | 9         | 12        |\n| Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP) | 36        | 35        |\n|                                            | 71        | 80        |",

Share-based payments continued\n\n## What share incentive arrangements do we have?\n\nOur plans include savings-related share option plans for employees and those of participating subsidiaries and several share plans for executives. All share-based payment plans are equity-settled. Details of these plans are set out below.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nUnder HMRC-approved savings-related share option plans, employees save on a monthly basis, over a three- or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted. This price is set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans. The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Similar plans operate for our overseas employees. The scheme did not operate in FY24 or FY23.\n\n## Yourshare\n\nIn FY21 and FY22, all eligible employees of the group were awarded \u00a3500 of BT shares. The shares are held in trust for a three-year vesting period after which they will be transferred to employees, providing they have been continuously employed during that time. A similar plan operated for overseas employees. Under the terms of Yourshare and the executive share plans, dividends are reinvested in shares that are added to the relevant share awards, unless the employee has elected to receive dividends in cash.\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)\n\nAwards are granted annually to selected senior employees where part of their bonus is awarded in shares in the group. These shares vest after three years.\n\n## Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP)\n\nAwards are granted to selected employees. Shares in the group are transferred to participants at the end of a specified retention or restricted period if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.\n\n## Incentive Share Plan (ISP)\n\nUnder this scheme, certain employees were awarded shares if the group met performance measures linked to total shareholder return, normalised free cash flow and revenue growth over a three year period. The last ISP was granted in 2019 and vested in 2022.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nMovements in Employee Saveshare options are shown below.\n\n|                         | Number of share options   | Number of share options   | Weighted average exercise price   | Weighted average exercise price   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 March     | 2024 millions             | 2023 millions             | 2024 pence                        | 2023 pence                        |\n| Outstanding at 1 April  | 269                       | 342                       | 102                               | 102                               |\n| Granted                 | -                         | -                         | -                                 | -                                 |\n| Forfeited               | (23)                      | (42)                      | 118                               | 130                               |\n| Exercised               | (64)                      | (5)                       | 89                                | 96                                |\n| Expired                 | (26)                      | (26)                      | 151                               | 208                               |\n| Outstanding at 31 March | 156                       | 269                       | 103                               | 102                               |\n| Exercisable at 31 March | -                         | -                         | -                                 | -                                 |\n\nThe weighted average share price for all options exercised during FY24 was 118p (FY23: 153p).\n\nThe following table summarises information relating to options outstanding and exercisable under Employee Saveshare plans at 31 March 2024.\n\n| Normal dates of vesting and exercise (based on calendar years)   | Exercise price per share   | Weighted average exercise price   |   Number of outstanding options millions |   Weighted average  remaining contractual  life (months) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2024                                                             | 164p                       | 164p                              |                                       27 |                                                       10 |\n| 2025                                                             | 82p                        | 82p                               |                                      129 |                                                       22 |\n| Total                                                            |                            | 96p                               |                                      156 |                                                       20 |",

An expected life of six months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option.\n\nThe fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date. The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in FY24 was 135p (FY23: 188p) and for RSP awards granted in FY24 was 112p (FY23: 183p).\n\n## 22. Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nWe classify non-current assets or a group of assets and associated liabilities, together forming a disposal group, as 'held for sale' when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through disposal rather than continuing use and the sale is highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed divestment within one year from the date of classification. We measure non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\nUpon completion of a divestment, we recognise a profit or loss on disposal calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest less costs incurred in disposing of the asset or disposal group and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or disposal group (including goodwill). The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item, see note 9.\n\nIn the event that non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale form a separate and identifiable major line of business, the results for both the current and comparative periods are reclassified as 'discontinued operations'.\n\n## Divestments\n\nDuring the year, we completed the disposals of certain city fibre networks and associated infrastructure assets in Germany and Pelipod Limited, both of which were classified as held for sale in FY23, and the disposal of BT Enia, a subsidiary of BT Italia. We recognised a net profit on disposal after tax of \u00a325m through specific items from these divestments, see below for further details.\n\nIn FY23, we completed the disposal of BT Sport operations through forming a sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recognising a profit on disposal after tax of \u00a328m through specific items. During the current year, we recorded \u00a310m additional net transaction costs through specific items and received \u00a324m from the deferred cash consideration recorded at completion of the transaction.\n\nThe disposals in the current or prior year have not been reclassified as discontinued operations as they do not meet our definition of a separate major line of business.",

Discovery (WBD) combining BT Sport and WBD's Eurosport UK business. As part of the transaction, the group's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc (BT plc or BT) and WBD each contributed, sub-licensed or delivered the benefit of their respective sports rights and distribution businesses for the UK & Ireland to the Sports JV. Both parties each hold a 50% interest and equal voting rights in the Sports JV.\n\nBT Sport's distribution agreement with Virgin Media transferred to the Sports JV, and the Sports JV also entered into an agreement with Sky extending beyond 2030 to provide for its distribution of the Sports JV's combined sports content.\n\nThe production and operational assets of BT Sport transferred to WBD who manage and operate the production of the Sports JV's sport content.\n\nBT plc entered into a distribution agreement with the Sports JV to procure the sport content required to continue to supply our broadband, TV and mobile customers. BT plc's agreement with the Sports JV will extend beyond 2030 and the first four years includes a minimum revenue guarantee of approximately \u00a3500m per annum, after which the agreement will change to a fully variable arrangement.\n\nBT no longer has control of the BT Sport operations based on the assessment of ownership and joint control over the key decisions of the Sports JV (50/50 with WBD) established through the Sports JV agreement. The group's retained ordinary equity interest in the combined business has been classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11, see note 24.\n\nWBD have the option to acquire BT plc's 50% interest in the Sports JV at specified points during the first four years of the Sports JV (Call Option). The price payable under the Call Option will be 50% of the fair market value of the Sports JV to be determined at the time of the exercise, plus any unpaid fixed consideration and remaining earn-out as described below. If the Call Option is not exercised, BT plc will have the ability to exit its shareholding in the Sports JV either through a sale or IPO after the initial four-year period.",

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\n## Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for the BT Sport disposal in FY23\n\nThe following critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements were made in accounting for the BT Sport disposal in FY23 only and are not considered to be ongoing significant judgements.\n\n## Assessment of whether BT has joint control over the Sports JV\n\nSee note 24 for assessment of control.\n\n## Valuation of investment in A preference shares (akin to contingent consideration)\n\nBT will receive an earn-out from the Sports JV (subject to liquidity and usual UK company law requirements), which will end at the earliest of:\n\n- - four years post completion of the transaction;\n- - the exercise by WBD of the Call Option; and\n- - if the earn-out reaches an agreed cap.\n\nThe earn-out cash flows to BT are dependent on the cash profit generation of the Sports JV over the earn-out period and is therefore akin to contingent consideration, initially recorded at a fair value of \u00a3428m reflecting the present value of expected cash flows.\n\nSubsequent to the initial recognition, the group's carried forward investment in A preference shares are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 9, see note 24.\n\n## Valuation of the minimum revenue guarantee in BT's distribution agreement with the Sports JV\n\nBT plc's obligation under the minimum revenue guarantee of c. \u00a32bn over the first four years of the Sports JV represents both a trading arrangement on market terms and a financing arrangement for the off-market element of the revenue guarantee, which has been recorded as a financial liability at an initial fair value of \u00a3712m.\n\nThe valuation of this financial liability, and what a fair cost-per-subscriber would be, is sensitive to a number of assumptions on volumes and price, and there is a range of outcomes which we could have arrived at. Alternative scenarios considered, based on the different prices and terms used with other market participants, could have resulted in a liability ranging from \u00a3543m to \u00a3837m.\n\nThe key assumptions in calculating the financial liability are in estimating what is a market wholesale price at market volume commitment that is supported by the forecast volumes for the related revenue streams. The volumes used are consistent with those included in the jointly-agreed business plan for the Sports JV. We note that the bottom of the range disclosed above is based on the price that we will pay when the minimum revenue guarantee has ended, however we do not believe that is an appropriate rate from the outset due to existing volume commitments.\n\nThe liability is held at amortised cost within trade and other payables on the balance sheet (see note 17) - the carrying amount at 31 March 2024 has reduced to \u00a3465m (FY23: \u00a3660m) after payments made to the Sports JV on the minimum revenue guarantee.\n\n## Valuation of BT's equity interest in the Sports JV\n\nWBD has the option to acquire BT plc's 50% interest in the Sports JV at specified points during the first four years of the Sports  JV. If the Call Option is not exercised, BT plc will have the ability to exit its shareholding in the JV either through a sale or IPO.\n\nThe group valued its interest in the Sports JV based on the estimated fair value at exit and using the following key assumptions:\n\n- - BT expect to realise its interest in the Sports JV through exit rather than ongoing value in use.\n- - BT expect WBD to exercise its option to acquire BT's 50% interest in the Sports JV at the end of the first four years of the Sports JV.\n- - An earnings multiple has been applied to the expected year 5 EBITDA per the jointly-agreed business plan - the multiple is at the lower end of a possible range identified from comparable peers and transactions in the premium sports subscription and broadcasting market.\n\nThe investment is subsequently accounted for using the equity method and will be subject to impairment testing at each reporting period, with any impairment losses recognised through specific items, see note 24.\n\n## Discounting of cash flows\n\nAll cash flows expected to be received or paid over time were discounted at a rate applicable to the risks associated with the cash flows:\n\n- - Deferred payments due to BT from WBD have been discounted at an appropriate post-tax cost of debt;\n- - BT's earn-out from the Sports JV has been discounted at the weighted average cost of capital for the Sports JV at completion date; and\n- - BT's commitments under the minimum guarantee have been discounted at the group's post-tax cost of debt.\n\nWe do not consider the net present value of the transaction would be materially affected by a reasonable change in the discount rate.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nAt 31 March 2024 there are no assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale at 31 March 2023 related to certain city fibre networks and associated infrastructure assets in Germany and Pelipod Limited. These divestments completed during FY24, and information on the gains and losses on disposal is disclosed above.",

The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Investments classified as fair value through profit and loss\n\nThese investments are initially recognised at fair value plus direct transaction costs. They are re-measured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value and changes are recognised directly in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nWe have made an irrevocable election to present changes in the fair value of equity investments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income. All gains or losses, aside from dividends, are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement when the investments are disposed of, instead any balance remaining in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained earnings. Dividends are recognised in the income statement when our right to receive payment is established. Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.\n\n| At 31 March                                   | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current assets                            |           |           |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 23        | 23        |\n| Fair value through profit or loss             | 6         | 6         |\n| Total non-current asset investments           | 29        | 29        |\n| Current assets                                |           |           |\n| Investments held at amortised cost            | 2,366     | 3,548     |\n| Current asset investments                     | 2,366     | 3,548     |\n\nInvestments held at amortised cost relate to money market investments denominated in sterling of \u00a32,355m (FY23: \u00a33,094m), in euros of \u00a35m (FY23: \u00a3446m) and US dollars of \u00a36m (FY23: \u00a38m).

The Sports JV is the only material equity-accounted investment held by the group, see below for further details.\n\n## Sports JV\n\nIn FY23 we formed the Sports JV (known externally as TNT Sports) with WBD, combining BT Sport and WBD's Eurosport UK business. Further details on the transaction are provided in note 22.\n\nKey developments in the Sports JV during the year:\n\n- - BT Sport's linear channels and live content were rebranded to TNT Sports prior to the start of the 2023/24 football season with streaming customers migrated to WBD's discovery+ platform in October 2023. Eurosport UK rebranding will follow later in the year.\n- - Underlying trading, before adjustments made to align with the group's accounting policies (see below), was profitable with stable subscriber volumes.\n- - Premier League rights were extended with a four-year deal to air 52 exclusively live matches per season until 2029, and a four-year deal was agreed with the Football Association to show the FA Cup from 2025.\n\nThe group holds both ordinary equity shares and preference shares in the Sports JV entity.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Joint ventures and associates continued\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to the Sports JV\n\n## Assessment of whether BT has joint control over the Sports JV\n\nThe Sports JV is classified as a joint venture based on an assessment under IFRS 10 and 11 of the ownership, voting power and joint control established through the joint venture agreement between BT and WBD.\n\nFactors relevant to our assessment:\n\n- - Equal voting rights over the activities that most significantly impact the returns of the Sports JV, namely decisions around new or existing sports rights and distribution arrangements.\n- - Unequal cash distribution during the first four years of the JV due to the earn-out mechanism and larger business contributed into the JV by BT.\n- - Revolving credit facility (RCF) provided by BT to fund short-term liquidity required by the Sports JV for working capital and commitments to sports rights holders.\n- - WBD's call option to acquire BT's 50% interest in the Sports JV is not exercisable before key decisions over material activities of the Sports JV are made such that joint control still applies.\n\nThe assessment whether joint control remains in place is reviewed at each reporting period.\n\n## Accounting policies adopted by the Sports JV\n\nThe Sports JV has a financial year-end of 31 July and has not yet prepared its first set of audited financial statements. In order to recognise our share of the Sports JV's results for our equity-accounted investment, we have prepared the Sports JV's financial information disclosed below based on management accounts for the period ending 31 March 2024 after making certain adjustments to comply with IFRS.\n\nSignificant judgements made in preparing the Sports JV's financial information:\n\n- - IFRS 3 acquisition accounting should be applied by the Sports JV over the business combination achieved through the transfer of the BT Sport and Eurosport UK businesses from BT and WBD respectively, recognising acquired intangibles on the current and future value of programme rights, and goodwill.\n- - Revenues from the minimum guarantee in the Sports JV's distribution agreement with BT should be adjusted to reflect a trading agreement on market terms with a separate financing arrangement for the off-market portion accounted for under IFRS 9 - this mirrors the accounting treatment applied by BT (see note 22).\n- - A and C preference shares issued by the Sports JV to BT should be classified as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9, as cash flows of the liability can be modified by both financial and non-financial factors that are not closely related to the instrument itself.\n- - Hedge accounting should be applied on the Sports JV's forward contracts with BT (see note 30) with fair value movements on the derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income and held in the cash flow hedge reserve until recycle on settlement of the forward contracts.\n- - Programme rights should be recognised on the balance sheet from the point at which the licence period begins and are consumed by the Sports JV on a straight-line basis over the programming period which is generally 12 months. This is consistent with accounting policy applied in our previous BT Sport operations that have been transferred to the Sports JV.\n\nAccounting policies in other areas are consistent with those applied by the group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key accounting estimates made in accounting for the Sports JV\n\n## Valuation of investment in A preference shares\n\nWe expect the group's A preference shares to be redeemed by the Sports JV for the distribution of cash to BT under our earn-out entitlement. BT's return on the shares is driven by the underlying cash profit generation of the Sports JV and therefore have been classified as a fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) financial asset under IFRS 9 and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.\n\nThe fair value recorded is supported by a jointly-agreed business plan and internal valuation model with the following key assumptions:\n\n- - Approximately 45% of revenues and 90% of costs during the remaining earn out period are contractually committed.\n- - Material contracts are renewed at an economic value no less than current terms.\n- - Total premium sports subscriber base does not materially grow or decline over the remaining earn-out period.\n\n## Ordinary equity shares\n\nOur retained ordinary equity interest in the Sports JV is held under the equity method of accounting, consistent with our accounting policy on associates and joint ventures.\n\n|                                                | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Carrying amount at 1 April                     | 352       | 414       |\n| Share of total comprehensive loss for the year | (52)      | (62)      |\n| Dividends received during the year             | -         | -         |\n| Carrying amount at 31 March                    | 300       | 352       |",

Underlying trading before these adjustments was profitable. In addition, the Sports JV had other comprehensive losses of \u00a322m relating to fair value movements on its foreign exchange hedging arrangement with the group (see note 30) that have been designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nOur share of the Sports JV's results in FY23 included amortisation from provisional fair value adjustments, which were subject to true-up within 12 months from the Sports JV formation. We have subsequently finalised these fair value adjustments and recorded a \u00a325m credit in the current year as a true-up to the amount recorded in FY23, of which our 50% share is \u00a313m. The difference is not material and therefore we have not retrospectively adjusted our share of total comprehensive loss in FY23.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nIn addition to BT's ordinary shareholding, BT held the following investments in preference shares in the Sports JV that have not been included within the equity-accounted interest above.\n\n| At 31 March                       |   2024 \u00a3m |   2023 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Investment in A preference shares |       387 |       429 |\n| Investment in C preference shares |       146 |       126 |\n| Total                             |       533 |       555 |\n\nA net \u00a322m movement has been recorded on the group's preference share investments relating to fair value changes only, see below for further details.\n\n- - A preference shares - a \u00a342m fair value loss has been recognised through specific items (see note 9), largely driven by a reduction in forecast cash flows following the Sports JV's investment in new sports content, leading to lower cash available for distribution under BT's earn-out entitlement.\n- - C preference shares - these shares are expected to be sold to WBD at the end of BT's earn-out entitlement in consideration for any sports rights funded by BT at that point. BT's return on the shares is driven by changes in the Sports JV's sports rights portfolio which in turn is dependent on changes in the wider sports rights market and the Sports JV's financial performance and are therefore held as a financial asset at FVTPL under IFRS 9. A \u00a320m fair value gain has been recognised through specific items (see note 9) driven by an expected growth in the Sports JV content portfolio, which will increase the payment to BT for pre-funded sports rights up to the end of BT's earn-out entitlement.\n\nThe preference shares are held at Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy, reflecting a valuation methodology that does not use inputs based on observable market data - see note 23 for further details on the fair value hierarchy. See below for sensitivities we have applied in determining the fair value.",

Joint ventures and associates continued\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe group's ordinary equity and preference share investments in the Sports JV, carry both upside and downside risk from changes in micro and macroeconomic factors affecting the sports content subscription market and risk appetite of investors in that market. Further, a key decision point in the next 12 months, relating to the renewal of a material customer contract, could significantly impact the value of our investments.\n\nWe have applied the following sensitivities to these risk factors:\n\n- - EBITDA decline from loss of revenue or improvement from outperformance against revised forecasts.\n- - Increase or decrease in the valuation multiple achieved.\n- - Increase or decrease in the discount rate applied.\n\n| Sensitivity                               | Fair value of A and C preference  shares in Sports JV   | Headroom on impairment test  over equity-accounted  investment   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 20% increase or decrease in EBITDA        | +/- \u00a3112m                                               | +/- \u00a3117m                                                        |\n| 10% increase or decrease in discount rate | +/- \u00a34m                                                 | +/- \u00a314m                                                         |\n| 10% change in valuation multiple          | -                                                       | +/- \u00a357m                                                         |\n\nNone of these sensitivities generated an impairment on the group's equity-accounted investment in the Sports JV.\n\nIn valuing our investments, we have assumed an exit after the earn-out period ends on the fourth anniversary of forming the Sports JV. However, an earlier exit would not have a material impact on the amounts recorded.\n\n## 25. Cash and cash equivalents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less. All are held at amortised cost on the balance sheet, equating to fair value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within the current element of loans and other borrowings (note 26).\n\n| At 31 March                                           | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                              | 332       | 336       |\n| Cash equivalents                                      |           |           |\n| Indian rupee deposits                                 | 74        | 55        |\n| Other deposits                                        | 8         | 1         |\n| Total cash equivalents                                | 82        | 56        |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents                       | 414       | 392       |\n| Bank overdrafts (note 26)                             | (58)      | (11)      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents per the cash flow statement | 356       | 381       |\n\nThe majority of cash at bank balance was held at counterparties with a credit rating of A2/A or above.

Loans and other borrowings\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to loans and other borrowings\n\nWe initially recognise loans and other borrowings at the fair value of amounts received net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and, if included in a fair value hedge relationship, are re-valued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. The resulting amortisation of fair value movements, on de-designation of the hedge, is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## What's our capital management policy?\n\nOur capital management policy targets an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target of BBB+/Baa1 and minimum rating of BBB/Baa2 while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and meeting our distribution policy. To meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue or repurchase shares or adjust dividends paid to shareholders. We manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it accordingly to reflect changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group. The Board regularly reviews the capital structure and capital management policy and no changes were made in FY24. For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 20.\n\nOur capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders' equity. The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.\n\n| At 31 March                         | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net debt                            | 19,479    | 18,859    |\n| Total parent shareholders' equity a | 12,513    | 14,490    |\n| Capital structure                   | 31,992    | 33,349    |\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities (both current and non-current) less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet. Amounts due to joint ventures and loans and borrowings recognised in relation to monies received from the sale of cash flows of contract assets and as prepayment for the forward sale of redundant copper are excluded. Currency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swap rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed. We explain the rationale for using net debt as a key performance indicator, together with changes to the metric in FY24, in Additional Information on page 231.\n\nNet financial debt is defined as net debt excluding lease liabilities.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (current and non-current), current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents. A reconciliation from these IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt is given below.\n\n| At 31 March                                                                                             | Notes   | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans and other borrowings a                                                                            |         | 18,526    | 18,521    |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                       | 15      | 4,955     | 5,359     |\n| Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale b                                                    | 22      | -         | 3         |\n| Less:                                                                                                   |         |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                               | 25      | (414)     | (392)     |\n| Current asset investments                                                                               | 23      | (2,366)   | (3,548)   |\n|                                                                                                         |         | 20,701    | 19,943    |\n| Adjustments:                                                                                            |         |           |           |\n| To retranslate debt balances at swap rates where hedged by currency swaps c                             |         | (512)     | (819)     |\n| To remove accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method and fair value  adjustments |         | (275)     | (254)     |\n| Loans with joint ventures                                                                               | 30      | (11)      | (11)      |\n| Loans related to the forward sale of redundant copper                                                   |         | (106)     | -         |\n| Loans related to sale of contract assets                                                                |         | (318)     | -         |\n| Net debt                                                                                                |         | 19,479    | 18,859    |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                       | 15      | (4,955)   | (5,359)   |\n| Lease liabilities classified as held for sale b                                                         |         | -         | (3)       |\n| Net financial debt                                                                                      |         | 14,524    | 13,497    |\n\n- c The translation difference between spot rate and hedged rate of loans and borrowings denominated in foreign currency.",

Financial instruments and risk management\n\nWe issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations; to finance corporate transactions such as share buybacks and acquisitions; for the temporary investment of short-term funds; and to manage currency and interest rate risks. In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.\n\n## How do we manage financial risk?\n\nOur activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Treasury operation\n\nWe have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated market risks, and credit risk.\n\n## Treasury policy\n\nTreasury policy is set by the Board. Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures. The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations. Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThere has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31 March 2024 and the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\n## How do we manage interest rate risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings. Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.\n\nOur policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of ongoing net debt is at fixed rates. Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the Chief Financial Officer, the Corporate Finance Director or the Group Treasury Director who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn order to manage our interest rate profile, we enter into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed. The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments. The majority of the group's long-term borrowings are subject to fixed sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.\n\n## How do we manage foreign exchange risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nForeign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.\n\nThe Board's policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.\n\nThe Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the Chief Financial Officer, the Corporate Finance Director or the Group Treasury Director.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nA significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in sterling. Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility. We do not have a material exposure to hyperinflationary economies.\n\nWe enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments. The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US dollars, euros, Indian rupees and",

To demonstrate this volatility, management has concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis:\n\n- - For interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across sterling, US dollar and euro currencies.\n- - For foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies.\n- - For energy, a 10% increase in energy prices.\n\nThe impact on equity, before tax and excluding any impact related to retirement benefit plans, of a 1% increase in interest rates, a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies, and a 10% increase in energy prices is as detailed below:\n\n| At 31 March              | 2024 \u00a3m Increase (reduce)   | 2023 \u00a3m Increase (reduce)   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Sterling interest rates  | 602                         | 579                         |\n| US dollar interest rates | (300)                       | (371)                       |\n| Euro interest rates      | (316)                       | (284)                       |\n| Sterling strengthening   | (142)                       | (169)                       |\n| Energy prices            | 27                          | 45                          |\n\nA 1% decrease in interest rates, 10% weakening of sterling against other currencies would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\nThe impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the group's annual net finance expense, 10% change in energy prices on group's income statement and our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging (excluding translation exposures), would not have been material in FY24 and FY23.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nWe continue to target a BBB+/Baa1 credit rating over the cycle, with a BBB/Baa2 floor. We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements. These include the pension deficit and shareholder distributions.\n\nOur December 2030 bond contains terms that require us to pay higher rates of interest when our credit ratings are below A3 in the case of Moody's or A- in the case of Standard & Poor's (S&P). Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade. Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of \u00a32.1bn at 31 March 2024, our finance expense would increase/decrease by approximately \u00a311m a year if the group's credit rating were to be downgraded/upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.\n\nOur credit ratings were as detailed below:\n\n|                   | 2024   | 2024    | 2023   | 2023    |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| At 31 March       | Rating | Outlook | Rating | Outlook |\n| Rating agency     |        |         |        |         |\n| Fitch             | BBB    | Stable  | BBB    | Stable  |\n| Moody's           | Baa2   | Stable  | Baa2   | Stable  |\n| Standard & Poor's | BBB    | Stable  | BBB    | Stable  |",

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## How do we manage liquidity risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nWe maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined by using short- and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period. On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the longterm funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters. We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise. The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2024 is disclosed in note 26. We have term debt maturities of \u00a30.7bn in FY25.\n\nOur treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by the Board. We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2024 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn (FY23: \u00a32.1bn) maturing in March 2027.\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of the remaining cash flows including interest payable for our non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which may therefore differ from both the carrying value and fair value.\n\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities At 31 March 2024   | Loans and other borrowings \u00a3m   | Interest on loans and other borrowings \u00a3m   | Trade and other payables c \u00a3m   | Lease  liabilities \u00a3m   | Provisions d \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                                     | 1,103                           | 738                                         | 5,438                           | 765                     | -

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## How do we manage energy price risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nUK (excluding Northern Ireland) and European energy prices continue to be exposed to volatility driven by fears of reduced gas supply as Europe continues the shift from Russian gas to LNG and renewables (which themselves are subject to short-term fluctuations given their intermittent nature). In order to manage our exposure to fluctuating energy prices, we have a target for UK (excluding Northern Ireland) energy demand to be at least 80% hedged one quarter before the start of the next financial year, and 50% hedged for the following financial year. We achieve this through forward over the counter hedges and a mixture of new and existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and derivative virtual PPAs (vPPAs).\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn each financial year our strategy is to build on our existing PPA and vPPA portfolio, exploring opportunities with 5-10 year contracts delivering favourable net present values. We complement this by monitoring the markets and forward purchasing electricity (power) when the market is favourable. In the forthcoming financial year the aim is to be 95% hedged, which allows for headroom for increased outputs from the renewable sources should weather conditions prevail.\n\n## How do we manage credit risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nOur exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation (primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents) and from trading-related receivables.\n\nFor treasury-related balances, the Board's defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3/A- for long-term and P1/A1 for short-term investments. If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.\n\nThe treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.\n\n## Operational management policy\n\nOur credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the customer-facing units (CFUs) to ensure compliance. The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards. Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit. We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure of the group's financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n| At 31 March                   | Notes   | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Derivative financial assets   |         | 1,070     | 1,479     |\n| Investments                   | 23      | 2,395     | 3,577     |\n| Trade and other receivables a | 16      | 2,224     | 1,821     |\n| Contract assets               | 5       | 1,740     | 1,934     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 25      | 414       | 392       |\n| Total                         |         | 7,843     | 9,203     |\n\nThe credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.

Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional \u00a31,047m (FY23: \u00a32,024m) of long-dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.",

Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\n## Material accounting policies that apply to derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAll of our derivative financial instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge\n\nThe group designates certain derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, hedge documentation must be prepared at inception, the hedge must be in line with BT's risk management strategy and there must be an economic relationship based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows of the hedging instrument and hedged item. This is assessed at inception and in subsequent periods in which the hedge remains in operation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer in line with BT's risk management strategy or if it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nThe group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is assessed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of altered timing, cash flows or value.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. For cash flow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the same line of the income statement and in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Other derivatives\n\nOur policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes. However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or may be specifically not designated as a hedge because natural offset is more appropriate. We effectively operate a process to identify any embedded derivatives within revenue, supply, leasing and financing contracts, including those relating to inflationary features. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are recognised at fair value. Any direct transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement in the line that most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction to which they relate.\n\nWhere the fair value of a derivative contract at initial recognition is not supported by observable market data and differs from the transaction price, a day one gain or loss will arise which is not recognised in the income statement. Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the income statement based on the remaining contractual term and as observable market data becomes available.\n\nThe fair values of outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.",

The transfer to realised profit includes a deferred tax adjustment.\n- b The fair value reserve is used to record gains or losses on equity investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income. When these investments are disposed of any remaining gains or losses in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained earnings.\n- c The cost of hedging reserve reflects the gain or loss on the portion excluded from the designated hedging instrument that relates to the currency basis element of our cross-currency swaps and forward points on certain foreign exchange contracts. It is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and accounted for similarly to gains or losses in the cash flow reserve.\n- d The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the net assets of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.\n- e Reclassification on cash flow hedges in FY23 includes \u00a3472m reclassification from cash flow hedge reserve to cost of hedging reserve.\n- f Excludes \u00a3nil (FY23: \u00a32m) of exchange differences in relation to retained earnings attributed to non-controlling interests.\n- g Movements in cash flow hedge-related reserves recognised in income and expense of \u00a3356m (FY23: \u00a3713m) include a net credit to other comprehensive income of \u00a3318m (FY23: charge of \u00a3679m) which have been reclassified to operating costs, and a net credit of \u00a338m (FY23: charge of \u00a334m) which have been reclassified to finance expense (see note 27).\n\n## 30. Related party transactions\n\nKey management personnel comprise Executive and Non-Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee . Compensation of key management personnel is disclosed in note 6.\n\nAmounts paid to the group's retirement benefit plans are set out in note 19.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures related parties include the Sports JV with Warner Bros formed during FY23 (see note 22). Sales of services to the Sports JV during FY24 were \u00a333m (FY23: \u00a323m), and purchases from the Sports JV were \u00a3299m (FY23: \u00a3176m) excluding \u00a3211m (FY23: \u00a361m) additional payments made to settle the minimum guarantee liability (see note 17). The amount receivable from the Sports JV as at 31 March 2024 was \u00a33m (FY23: 10m) and the amount payable to the Sports JV was \u00a394m (FY23: \u00a3123m).\n\nAs part of the BT Sport transaction, the group has committed to providing the Sports JV with a sterling Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), up to a maximum for \u00a3300m, for short-term liquidity required by the Sports JV to fund its working capital and commitments to sports rights holders. Amounts drawn down by the Sports JV under the RCF accrue interest at a market reference rate, consistent with the group's external short-term borrowings. The outstanding balance under the RCF of \u00a3163m (FY23: \u00a3268m) is treated as a loan receivable and held at amortised cost, see note 16. The capacity of the RCF is expected to reduce to \u00a3200m during FY25. There is also a loan payable to the Sports JV of \u00a311m (FY23: \u00a311m), see note 26.\n\nThe Sports JV has a foreign exchange hedging arrangement with the group to secure euros required to meet its commitments to certain sports rights holders; the group has external forward contracts in place to purchase the euros at an agreed sterling rate in order to mitigate its exposure to exchange risk. The group holds a \u00a329m (FY23: \u00a314m) derivative liability in respect of forward contracts provided to the Sports JV.",

Related party transactions continued\n\nTransactions from commercial trading arrangements with associates and joint ventures, including the Sports JV, are shown below:\n\n| At 31 March                                           |   2024 \u00a3m |   2023 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sales of services to associates and joint ventures    |        37 |        29 |\n| Purchases from associates and joint ventures          |       338 |       216 |\n| Amounts receivable from associates and joint ventures |         5 |        10 |\n| Amounts payable to associates and joint ventures      |        95 |       124 |\n\nOther related party transactions include a dividend received from a joint venture of \u00a312m (FY23: \u00a3nil) and in the prior year the purchase of energy from an entity controlled by the BT Pension Scheme until FY24. FY23 total purchases were \u00a313m and \u00a31m was due to the other party as at 31 March 2023.\n\n## 31. Financial commitments\n\nFinancial commitments as at 31 March 2024 include capital commitments of \u00a31,049m (FY23: \u00a31,480m) and device purchase commitments of \u00a3171m (FY23: \u00a3217m).\n\nTV programme rights commitments were transferred to the Sports JV formed with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) during FY23 (see note 22). Both the group and WBD have guaranteed the Sports JV's obligations under certain programme rights commitments; the fair value of these parent company guarantees is not material.\n\nOther than as disclosed below and in note 18, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees at 31 March 2024 other than those arising in the ordinary course of the group's business and on these no material losses are anticipated. We have insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of our operations. Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.\n\n## Legal and regulatory proceedings\n\nSee note 18 for contingent liabilities associated with legal and regulatory proceedings.",

Re-presentation of prior year comparatives\n\nWe have re-presented certain FY23 comparatives to reflect changes to the methodology used to allocate certain shared costs, and the creation of our Business CFU. See note 1 for more details.\n\nThe following disclosures are impacted by the creation of the Business unit only. Re-presentation of prior year comparatives is limited to the combination of the balances previously reported in respect of the Enterprise and Global units, with no further adjustments:\n\n- - Note 5 Revenue: disaggregation of external revenue\n- - Note 7 Employees: number of employees\n- - Note 16 Trade and other receivables: trade receivables not past due and accrued income by CFU\n\nNote 4 Segment information is also impacted by changes to the allocation of shared costs and therefore includes additional adjustments.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the company financial statements\n\n## 1. BT Group plc accounting policies\n\n## Principal activity\n\nThe principal activity of the company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the BT Group.\n\n## Accounting basis\n\nAs used in these financial statements and associated notes, the term 'company' refers to BT Group plc (a public company limited by shares). These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. Refer to page 150 for further details of this assessment.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company's profit and loss account has not been presented.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThe following amended standards were effective during the year, none of which had a material impact on the financial statements of the company.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nBT adopted IFRS 17 with retrospective application on 1 April 2023. We have assessed the impact of the standard on the company, and concluded that its impact is not material. Contracts in scope of the standard are restricted to parent company guarantees, which we have assessed to have no material impact.\n\n## Disclosure of Accounting policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)\n\nThese amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. The amendments have not resulted in any changes to accounting policies disclosures made in these financial statements.\n\n## Definition of Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8)\n\nThe amendments introduce a new definition for accounting estimates.The amendments have not resulted in any changes to accounting policies disclosures made in these financial statements.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)\n\nThe amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.The amendments have not resulted in any changes to accounting policies disclosures made in these financial statements.\n\n## Exemptions\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to business combinations, share-based payments, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, and presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. The company intends to continue to take advantage of these exemptions in future years. Further detail is provided below.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 contain a consolidated cash flow statement. Consequently, as permitted by IAS 7 'Statement of Cash flow', the company has not presented its own cash flow statement.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 contain related party disclosures. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' not to disclose transactions with other members of the BT Group.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. Consequently, the company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 in respect of its financial instruments.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertaking\n\nInvestment in subsidiary undertaking is stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by continuing to hold the asset and benefiting from the net present value of the future cash flows (value in use) of the investment.\n\nInvestment impairment is assessed at each reporting date. Estimating value in use and key assumptions used (discount rate and growth rate) in performing the impairment assessment are in line with how we assess the group's goodwill in note 13 to the consolidated group financial statements. There is significant headroom between the carrying value of the investment and the calculated value in use. See Note 2 for further details.\n\n## Taxation\n\nFull provision is made for deferred taxation on all temporary differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not discounted.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders for final dividends. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. Dividend income is recognised on receipt.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Repurchased shares of the company are recorded in the balance sheet as part of Own shares and presented as a deduction from shareholders' equity at cost.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe issuance by the company of share options and awards to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. An addition to the company's investment in subsidiaries is recorded with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders' funds. The additional capital contribution is determined based on the fair value of options and awards at the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period.",

Investment in subsidiary undertaking\n\n| Cost             | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2022  | 11,201     |\n| Additions        | 77         |\n| At 31 March 2023 | 11,278     |\n| Additions        | 68         |\n| At 31 March 2024 | 11,346     |\n\nThe company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout FY24 and FY23. Additions of \u00a368m (FY23: \u00a377m) comprise capital contributions in respect of share-based payments.\n\nInvestment impairment is assessed at each reporting date to evaluate if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As market capitalisation was less than the cost of investment at points during the year we have performed an impairment review. This was performed in line with the Group goodwill impairment review as detailed in Note 13 of the consolidated accounts.\n\nOur FY24 assessment concluded that there remains significant headroom between the carrying value of the investment and the calculated value in use of the investment. We have exercised a number of assumptions in determining the future cash flows, discount rate and growth rate to arrive at this conclusion.\n\nValue in use is estimated by discounting future cash flows. Future cash flows  are calculated on a nominal basis and based on riskadjusted projections derived from the latest Board-approved fiveyear financial plans, representing management's best riskadjusted estimate of future growth. This includes the direct and indirect impacts of inflation and associated mitigations. Plans reflect management's expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance, and form the basis of outlook issued by the group.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation was 9.25%. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the calculation of the group's weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.\n\nIn FY24 we have used perpetuity growth rates averaging 0.8% as determined based on the long-term growth prospects of each market. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets and analysts' expectations. None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected average long-term growth rates for those markets or sectors.\n\nWe consider there to be no reasonably possible scenario in which an impairment could occur within the next 12 months from the reporting date.\n\n## 3. Other information\n\n## Dividends\n\nAn interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3227m was paid on 2 February 2024 (FY23: interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3226m paid). A final dividend of 5.69p per share amounting to approximately \u00a3553m is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2024 (FY23: final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to \u00a3530m paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023).\n\n## Employees and directors\n\nThe Chairman and the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of BT Group plc were the only employees and directors of the company during FY24 and FY23. The costs relating to qualifying services provided to the company's principal subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, are recharged to that company.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures we use are: adjusted revenue, adjusted operating costs, adjusted finance expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share, return on capital employed, normalised free cash flow and net debt. We also reference adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a Sports JV pro forma basis. The rationale for using these measures, along with a reconciliation from the nearest measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, is presented below.\n\nThe alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, impairment of goodwill, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, historical property-related provisions, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nMovements relating to the sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), such as fair value gains or losses on the A and C preference shares or impairment charges on the equity-accounted investment as specific. Refer to note 24 for further detail.\n\nDetails of items meeting the definition of specific items in the current and prior year are set out in note 9.\n\nReported revenue, reported operating costs, reported operating profit, reported net finance expense, reported profit before tax and reported earnings per share are the equivalent IFRS measures. A reconciliation from these can be seen in the group income statement on page 145.\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities (both current and non-current) less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet.\n\nAmounts due to joint ventures, loans and borrowings recognised in relation to monies received from the sale of cash flows of contract assets and as prepayment for the forward sale of redundant copper are excluded.\n\nCurrency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swap rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed.\n\nNet debt is a measure of the group's net indebtedness that provides an indicator of overall balance sheet strength. It is a key indicator used by management to assess both the group's cash position and its indebtedness. The use of the term 'net debt' does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.\n\nAs aligned with our normalised free cash flow metric, from FY24 onwards we exclude loans and borrowings recognised in relation to:\n\n- - Asset monetisation programmes, in which monies received from the sale of cash flows of contract assets are recorded as liabilities (and the contract asset is not derecognised) until certain performance obligations in the contract are fulfilled and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Excluding these liabilities is considered to improve the relevance of the net debt metric as it is consistent with the treatment of related cash flows in normalised free cash flow as noted above; and aligns with the underlying rationale and management's view that substantially all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of these assets have been transferred to the end buyer. These liabilities do not reflect the group's indebtedness as they will be extinguished upon the transfer of ringfenced operational cash flows from end customers which management are confident will be received.\n- - Monies received as prepayment for the forward sale of redundant copper, which are recognised as liabilities until there is physical delivery of the copper (further details in note 26). Excluding these liabilities is again considered to improve the relevance of the net debt metric by aligning with the treatment of related cash flows in normalised free cash flow and the fact that balances are not representative of the group's true indebtedness given that they will be settled by the physical delivery of copper, rather than cash or any other financial asset.\n\nNet financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities. It allows for the comparison to net debt measures reported before the introduction of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, and reflects a view that lease liabilities are operational debt in substance, rather than financing transactions.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset investments, the most directly comparable IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt, is set out in note 26.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information continued\n\n## Return on Capital Employed\n\nWe use a return on capital employed (ROCE) measure that serves as an indicator of how efficiently we generate returns from the capital invested in the business. It is a group KPI that is directly relatable to the outcome of investment decisions.\n\nROCE represents the group's returns as percentage of capital employed.\n\nReturns are defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax. We use an adjusted measure (before specific items) for the reasons explained in the 'specific items' section above.\n\nCapital employed represents equity, debt and debt-like liabilities. We net the derivative financial instruments and cash and cash equivalent balances that we use to manage financial risk against gross debt, and exclude current and deferred tax balances as the measure is determined on a pre-tax basis.\n\nFrom FY24 we also exclude amounts due to joint ventures, loans and borrowings recognised in relation to monies received from the sale of cash flows of contract assets and as prepayment for the forward sale of redundant copper. In line with the net debt definition on page 231. In the table below we have restated the FY23 comparative to align with the updated definition and excluded \u00a311m net loans from joint ventures, however it has not changed the ROCE metric from the previously reported 8.3%.\n\nWhile our long-term capital investment programmes such as our full fibre rollout deliver value-creating long-term returns, they suppress ROCE in the short- to medium-term.\n\nThe following table sets out the calculation of our ROCE measure. In doing so it reconciles returns to operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, and presents the components of capital employed.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 (restated) \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Reported operating profit for the  period                            | 2,214     | 2,619                |\n| Share of post tax profits (losses) of  associates and joint ventures | (21)      | (59)                 |\n| Specific items (non-finance and tax)                                 | 987       | 556                  |\n| Return for the period                                                | 3,180     | 3,116                |\n| Equity, debt and debt-like  liabilities                              |           |                      |\n| Loans and other borrowings                                           | 18,526    | 18,521               |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 4,955     | 5,359                |\n| Retirement benefit obligations                                       | 4,882     | 3,139                |\n| BDUK grant funding deferral                                          | 228       | 427                  |\n| Total equity                                                         | 12,518    | 14,514               |\n| Adjust for balances used to                                          |           |                      |\n| hedge financial risk Cash and cash equivalents                       | (414)     | (392)                |\n| Investments                                                          | (2,395)   | (3,577)              |\n| Net derivative financial instruments                                 | (531)     | (1,096)              |\n| Adjust for tax balances                                              |           |                      |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities                                         | 485       | 911                  |\n| Net current tax receivable                                           | (331)     | (349)                |\n| Adjust in line with net debt  definition                             |           |                      |\n| Net loans with joint ventures                                        | (11)      | (11)                 |\n| Loans related to sale of contract  assets                            | (318)     | -                    |\n| Loans related to the forward sale of  redundant copper               | (106)     | -                    |\n| Capital employed                                                     | 37,488    | 37,446               |\n| Return on capital employed                                           | 8.5 %     | 8.3 %                |\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nIn addition to measuring financial performance of the group and customer-facing units based on adjusted operating profit, we also measure performance based on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\nWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure of our operating performance because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.\n\nA reconciliation of reported profit for the period, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted EBITDA, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reported profit for the period                                       | 855       | 1,905     |\n| Tax                                                                  | 331       | (176)     |\n| Reported profit before tax                                           | 1,186     | 1,729     |\n| Net finance expense                                                  | 1,007     | 831       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation,  including impairment charges         | 5,398     | 4,818     |\n| Specific revenue                                                     | 38        | (12)      |\n| Specific operating costs before  depreciation and amortisation       | 450       | 503       |\n| Share of post tax losses (profits) of  associates and joint ventures | 21        | 59        |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                      | 8,100     | 7,928     |\n\n## Normalised free cash flow\n\nNormalised free cash flow is one of the group's key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured. It is primarily a liquidity measure. However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is defined as free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid, payment of lease liabilities, net cash flows from the sale of cash flows related to contract assets, monies received as prepayment for the sale of redundant copper, dividends received from non-current asset investments, associates and joint ventures, and net purchase or disposal of non-current asset investments, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends paid, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, repayment and raising of debt, cash flows relating to short-term funding arrangements with joint ventures, and cash flows relating to the Building Digital UK demand deposit account which have already been accounted for within normalised free cash flow. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.\n\nAs reflected above and communicated in our FY23 annual report, from FY24 we have updated our normalised free cash flow metric to reflect the ongoing evolution of the business:\n\n- - We include the sale of cash flows of contract assets related to mobile handsets where the performance obligations have been substantially delivered to the customer. This is a financing cash flow in the cash flow statement as certain performance obligations in the contract need to be fulfilled before the right to consideration is unconditional. The underlying rationale for entering into these transactions is however for the purpose of working capital management as handset costs are incurred up front but recovered throughout the customer contract term.

        "page_content": "therefore view the related cash flows as equivalent to working capital cash flows internally, and consider that they should be treated in the same way as operating cash inflows in our external normalised free cash flow metric in order to provide the most relevant information to the users of the financial statements. The corresponding operating cash inflow received from customers is excluded from normalised free cash flow if it has previously been included at the time of the sale of the contract assets.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.\n\nA reconciliation from cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to free cash flow and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash generated from operations a                                     | 6,012     | 6,588     |\n| Tax paid                                                             | (59)      | 136       |\n| Net cash inflow from operating activities                            | 5,953     | 6,724     |\n| Net purchase of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets | (4,967)   | (5,307)   |\n| Free cash flow                                                       | 986       | 1,417     |\n| Interest received                                                    | 140       | 41        |\n| Interest paid                                                        | (865)     | (709)     |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                                         | (748)     | (727)     |\n| Dividends received from joint ventures,  associates and investments  | 20        | 9         |\n| Net purchase of non-current asset  investments                       | -         | (5)       |\n| Add back pension deficit payments                                    | 823       | 994       |\n| Add back net cash flow from specific  items                          | 439       | 404       |\n| Net cashflows from sale of contract  assets related to handsets      | 305       | -         |\n| Cash flows relating to the BDUK demand  deposit account              | 75        | (96)      |\n| Prepayment for forward sale of copper                                | 105       | -         |\n| Normalised free cash flow                                            | 1,280     | 1,328     |\n\nBelow we reconcile normalised free cash flow by unit:\n\n| Year ended 31 March       | 2024 \u00a3m   | 2023 (re-presented) a \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|\n| Consumer                  | 1,023     | 963                        |\n| Business                  | 431       | 648                        |\n| Openreach                 | 590       | 219                        |\n| Other                     | (764)     | (502)                      |\n| Normalised free cash flow | 1,280     | 1,328                      |\n\n## Sports JV pro forma basis\n\nOn 3 September 2022 BT Group and Warner Bros.
