Macquarie's activities are also subject to supervision by various other regulatory agencies around the world.\n\nFounded in 1969, Macquarie now employs over 20,600 (1) people globally, has total assets of $A 403.4 billion and total equity of $A 34.0 billion as at 31 March 2024.\n\nMacquarie's breadth of expertise covers asset management, retail and business banking, wealth management, leasing and asset financing, market access, commodity trading, renewables development, specialist advice, access to capital and principal investment. The diversity of our operations, combined with a strong capital position and robust risk management framework, has contributed to Macquarie's 55-year record of unbroken profitability.\n\nMacquarie works with government, institutional, corporate and retail clients and counterparties around the world, providing a diversified range of products and services. We have established leading market positions as a global specialist in a wide range of sectors, including renewables, infrastructure, resources, commodities and energy.\n\nAlignment of interests is a longstanding feature of Macquarie's client-focused business, demonstrated by our willingness to both invest alongside clients and closely align the interests of our shareholders and staff.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2024",

The volatility in global energy markets that had previously increased customer demand for services and presented trading opportunities gave way to much quieter conditions, and hence lower earnings for the Commodities and Global Markets business. For much of the year, less active financial markets also constrained other areas of the Company's business, particularly in Macquarie Asset Management. As long-term investments in growth paid off, Banking and Financial Services and Macquarie Capital both generated higher profits than last year. Shemara's letter gives a more detailed account of performance during the year.\n\nThe company earned a return on shareholders' funds for the year of 10.8%, a bit below the level Macquarie typically seeks to achieve. Over the past five years, Macquarie has earned around 15% for shareholders on average.\n\nIncreases in headcount and in the broader cost base have been difficult to avoid in recent years given the extent of business growth, the volume of project work and particularly the increase in regulatory requirements. As some of these projects now deliver planned productivity benefits, management has heightened its focus on costs and is working to ensure value for shareholders.\n\nThe global economy appears to have stabilised after the disturbances of the immediate post-COVID period, and inflation has declined. Low inflation is not yet assured, however, and the prospects for interest rates are unclear.\n\nMacquarie remains well placed to respond to opportunities - and to manage the associated risks - thanks to the diversity of our businesses, enduring client franchises, a strong balance sheet and our disciplined approach to risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie remains well placed to respond to opportunities and manage the associated risks, thanks to the diversity of our businesses, enduring client franchises, strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to risk management.'",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental Social and Governance\n\nMacquarie issued its second Net Zero and Climate Risk Report in late 2023. We continue to manage on balance sheet lending and equity exposures in line with our Net Zero Banking Alliance commitments. In addition, and probably more significantly, we continued to support the development of clean energy infrastructure, with 110 GW of clean energy capacity in development, construction, or operation at the end of FY2024. (2)\n\nWith global emissions still increasing, despite the rapid increase in renewable capacity, the global and local conversation about climate change has become more nuanced, and more challenging, as the full magnitude of the decarbonisation challenge becomes apparent. Recent experience highlights that fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, will be required for quite some time to come, even as the trend to renewables continues.\n\nWhile financial institutions have an important role to play in marshalling financial resources for the transitions their clients are seeking to make, the carbon intensity of financial portfolios can only decline by as much, and as fast, as the underlying physical capital stock of economies is able to decarbonise. That will be determined mainly by non-financial factors - technological advancements, government policies, the supply of skilled labour and of other necessary capacity.\n\nWithin its field of influence and capability, and with around 20 years' experience in advancing climate solutions, Macquarie is well-positioned to continue playing a constructive role as a financier, adviser, investor and fiduciary. We expect this to be to the benefit of shareholders.\n\n## New workplaces\n\nTechnological change is challenging conventional notions of the way work is done. Yet the physical workplace is still important as a place to come together, to collaborate, innovate and to advance professional development.\n\nMacquarie has continued to invest in our physical workplaces around the world. This year sees the opening of our new global headquarters in Sydney, part of an ambitious project that integrates a major interchange for the city's new Metro transport system with two state-of-the-art office buildings and a regenerated public space. The project is one of Macquarie's largest balance sheet infrastructure undertakings to date and is a prime example of how we connect capital with community need.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nNicola Wakefield Evans retired from the Board in February 2024, having served for ten years. Nicola made an important contribution to Macquarie both in her career as a professional lawyer and as a Director, including for over seven years as Chair of the Board Governance and Compliance Committee, a responsibility that has now been taken on by Rebecca McGrath.\n\nDuring the year, Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz joined the MGL and MBL Boards as an independent director. Susan brings with her significant expertise in the global investment and real estate sectors and is already making a valued contribution.\n\nThe process of appointing Bank-only Non-Executive Directors (BONDs) to the MBL Board was completed with the appointment of David Whiteing in September 2023 and Wayne Byres in February 2024. Both bring highly valued skills and experience to the MBL board.\n\nAs previously advised, Michael Coleman will retire from the MBL Board after a two-year term as a BOND, expected by mid-2024. Michael has been associated with Macquarie as a Director for 12 years including nine years as Chair of the Audit Committee. We thank him for his exemplary service.\n\n## Capital and Dividends\n\nThe company finished the year in a strong position, with the Bank Group posting a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of over 13% on an APRA basis, and with surplus capital at the MGL level. The Board declared a final dividend of $A3.85 per share, making for a total dividend of $A6.40 per share for the full year. This was in keeping with the Board's longstanding policy of paying between 50 and 70 per cent of earnings in dividends.\n\nIn November 2023, the Board also approved an on-market buy-back for Macquarie Group shares of up to $A2 billion. As at 31 March 2024, $A644 million had been purchased under this program. This decision returns more of the exceptional returns of FY2022 and FY2023 to shareholders.\n\nIt remains for me to thank my colleagues on the Board, and the staff and management of Macquarie, for their efforts in a challenging year. This is a high-performing team that remains focused on delivering the best possible results for shareholders.\n\nFinally, your Directors thank you, the owners of Macquarie, for your ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlenn Stevens AC\n\nIndependent Director and Chair\n\nSydney\n\n3 May 2024",

Our people partnered with our clients and communities as they navigated and adapted to uncertainty, identifying and realising new opportunities guided by our purpose and principles and supported by our proven risk management framework and distinct culture.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2024, in what was a period of transition for some of our businesses against a backdrop of less active markets, Macquarie delivered net profit after tax of $A 3,522 million, down 32% on a record prior year, with all four of our operating groups delivering solid net profit contributions.\n\nBanking and Financial Services (BFS) delivered a record net profit contribution of $A1,241 million, up 3 % from $A1,201 million in FY2023. BFS benefitted from growth in the loan portfolio and BFS deposits, and credit and other impairment reversals primarily reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. This was partially\n\noffset by margin compression, higher employment expenses and technology investment to support portfolio growth, compliance and regulatory requirements.\n\nCommodities and Global Markets (CGM) delivered a net profit contribution of $A3,213 million, down 47% from a record $A6,007 million in FY2023. Despite an environment characterised by much lower levels of market volatility, CGM delivered revenues at a similar level to the strong performance of FY2022, demonstrating ongoing growth and resilience in the client franchise. The result reflected a lower contribution from Commodities and Asset Finance, partially offset by stronger performance in Financial Markets.\n\nMacquarie Asset Management (MAM) delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,208 million, down 48 % from $A2,342 million in FY2023. The decrease was driven by lower asset realisations in green investments and increased net expenditure in investments in the green energy portfolio as it continues its transition into a fiduciary business. Base and performance fees were broadly in line with the prior year.\n\nMacquarie Capital delivered a net profit contribution of $A 1,051 million, up 31 % from $A801 million in FY2023. The increase was driven by higher investment-related income driven by growth in the private credit portfolio, lower credit provisions and net reversals of impairments, partially offset by lower net gains on investments, lower advisory income and higher operating expenses.\n\nThis report provides examples of key areas of activity across Macquarie in FY2024, and explains how, by empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future, our teams continue to create value for our clients, communities, shareholders and each other.",

        "page_content": "## Advancing climate solutions\n\nDespite the more challenging macroeconomic backdrop, last year saw record levels of investment in clean energy and in the deployment of clean technology to reduce broad-based emissions, supported by transformative government policy, investment incentives and investor appetite in major markets around the world.\n\nWhile certain sub-sectors of the climate response were affected by higher levels of inflation and supply chain constraints, and some governments scaled back their most ambitious climate pledges, long-term momentum supporting the energy transition persists.\n\nAt Macquarie, we are using our deep expertise to develop, construct, finance and manage practical solutions to climate change across six continents. We are investing in renewable energy solutions at scale, supporting the next wave of climate technologies, working with clients and portfolio companies on their decarbonisation ambitions, and investing in nature, adaptation and resilience.\n\nOur longstanding view remains that a managed glidepath to deliver an orderly energy transition is the best long-term solution to the energy trilemma of availability, affordability, and emissions.\n\n## A culture of entrepreneurialism\n\nBy balancing entrepreneurial spirit with operational discipline, actively seeking out and involving the contribution of others, and applying expertise and skills, our people generate new ideas that support our clients and communities through constantly changing times, while also managing risks and being accountable for the outcomes they deliver. I am proud of the many ways that our people have stepped up to support our clients in navigating changing and challenging times.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions have escalated over recent years, very real and often tragic human impacts have been exacerbated by the greater uncertainty inflicted on the economic environment. Addressing the key opportunities and challenges the world faces requires the imagination, ideas and innovation that emerge when you collaborate and bring together diverse points of view. We work hard to maintain a culture that empowers people to identify and realise opportunity, and supports them to learn, achieve and succeed.\n\n## Opportunities in new technologies\n\nMacquarie is committed to investing in and making generative AI technologies available to our people to unlock productivity, enhance creativity and improve outcomes, ultimately enhancing the experiences of our clients and the community. In FY2024, we piloted a range of Generative AI products and commenced the rollout of enterprise tools to help our staff with everyday activities. Our businesses continue to explore targeted solutions in their areas. Through a strong focus on AI governance and risk management, we have the guardrails in place to protect our people, our business and our clients.\n\n## Investing in our communities and our workplaces\n\nA founding principle of Macquarie is creating value for the communities in which we operate by using our expertise to address areas of unmet need, and each of our businesses seeks to do this across their areas of focus.\n\nAs a global leader in the infrastructure sector, we develop and manage essential assets that connect communities around the world. This includes creating, investing in, and operating assets across the energy, utility, transportation, digital, waste management and social sectors.\n\nIn 2024, we will open our new global headquarters in the heart of Sydney, which has drawn on our team's skillsets across a complex urban, multi-sector development. Part of a new integrated transport and community precinct being delivered in partnership with the New South Wales Government, the project will provide a place for people to come together, facilitate interaction across communities and deliver shared value to all.\n\nThis will be followed by the opening of our new regional headquarters for the Americas at 660 Fifth Avenue in New York, coinciding with our 30th anniversary of operating in the region.\n\n## Management changes\n\nAfter 28 years with Macquarie and five years as Group Head, Nicholas O'Kane stepped down as Head of CGM and from Macquarie's Executive Committee, on 27 February 2024. Simon Wright, who was Global Head of CGM's Financial Markets division and has been with Macquarie for 35 years, became Group Head, joining the Executive Committee on 1 April 2024.\n\nI would like to thank Nick for his significant contribution to CGM and Macquarie more broadly. He leaves a team and business that is very well-positioned for the future, and I look forward to continuing to work with Simon to build on CGM's success.\n\n## External outlook\n\nMarket conditions are likely to remain challenging for some time, making forecasting difficult. While we haven't provided overall guidance for the 2025 financial year, factors impacting our client franchises in the short-term outlook are outlined further in this report.\n\nMacquarie remains well-positioned to deliver superior performance for our clients, communities and shareholders in the medium term due to Macquarie's diversification, businesses that lead in their niches, and our combination of global knowledge and local expertise. These are supported by a strong and conservative balance sheet, ongoing investment in our operating platform, flexibility to allocate capital, and our proven risk management framework and culture.\n\nOn behalf of senior management, we would like to thank Macquarie's staff for their work and dedication. As a services business, our people are one of our greatest strengths and our success over the past 55 years has been driven their expertise, commitment and ideas. Such success would not be possible without the support of our clients and shareholders, for which the Macquarie team is extremely grateful.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shemara Wikramanayake\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSydney\n\n3 May 2024",

(5) MAM also launched Aula Energy, a new Australasia-focused renewables platform created with an initial onshore wind development pipeline of ~4GW of capacity.\n\nDuring the year, Macquarie Capital acquired ONYX Insight, a leading provider of wind turbine performance analytics and condition-based monitoring to the wind energy industry. ONYX monitors more than 17,000 turbines in over 30 countries, providing technology solutions to 7 of the top 10 wind asset owners. (6)\n\nBeyond renewables, MAM sees a growing opportunity to generate new institutional investment in more nascent elements of the energy transition and reached first close on Macquarie's first energy transition fund, Macquarie Green Energy Transition Solutions. Aligned to this strategy, MAM also became the lead investor in a funding round to support the construction of a 16 GWh/year gigafactory in Dunkirk, France. Among other investments, MAM also committed to support an industrial-scale green nitrogen fertiliser development platform in the Americas, contributing to the decarbonisation of the agriculture sector.\n\nCGM continues to develop and deploy climate solutions to help clients with their decarbonisation pathways, including those in carbon-intensive industries, and to support new initiatives in clean fuels and critical minerals. This includes helping meet growing demand for the supply of low-carbon methanol by the shipping industry, through logistics, capital and price risk management services. The business has also developed a new lithium hedging solution to help corporate clients de-risk their supply chains, supporting greater availability of the mineral for the manufacture of clean technologies.\n\n(4)\n\nBloombergNEF.\n\n(5)\n\n'West of Orkney Windfarm first ScotWind project to submit offshore consent application', West of Orkney Windfarm.\n\n(6)\n\n'About us', ONYX Insight.\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n## Progress towards net zero\n\nDuring the year, we published our second Net Zero and Climate Risk Report. It provided an update on financed emissions targets for the coal, oil/gas and motor vehicle sectors, and added new targets for Australian residential mortgage lending. We now have targets in place for over 80% of our dollar ($A) exposures to carbon intensive sectors.\n\nMAM is committed to investing and managing its portfolio in line with global net zero scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, where it has control or significant influence. (7) It is working with its portfolio companies and properties to ensure their net zero business plans are firmly embedded within their organisations and supported by the right resources, providing them with access to Macquarie's breadth of green investment expertise, industrial capabilities and specialist external partners. Where it does not have control or significant influence, such as in its managed portfolio of public securities, MAM will continue to support the goals of the Paris Agreement (8) in a manner consistent with its client-guided fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities.\n\nWe believe that the energy transition needs to be managed, orderly and just, and CGM is actively supporting carbon-intensive industries to reduce their emissions while maintaining the vital services they provide and on which communities and industries rely. The scale and breadth of the transition is driving the delivery of holistic solutions across CGM's activities, markets, and client sectors, including carbon and emissions; renewable and flexible power; clean fuels; sustainable transport; critical minerals; the circular economy; and sustainable finance.\n\nRepresentatives from across Macquarie attended our third successive Conference of the Parties (COP28), meeting with clients and stakeholders in Dubai to discuss the role that we play to support countries and corporates' ambitions to reach net zero.",

Using artificial intelligence and video analytics to monitor safe behaviours and conditions, Forwood's technology has now been implemented across more than 800 sites globally.\n\nMacquarie Capital also supported Partners Group's refinancing of Civica, which provides software to public bodies across government, healthcare and education in the UK, Asia and the US that helps them increase the efficiency and transparency of service delivery. (9)\n\nMAM continues to encourage its portfolio companies to implement board-approved DEI strategies. One such example is portfolio company 2degrees, a New Zealand telecommunications provider, which has secured Rainbow Tick certification, awarded to organisations that demonstrate they understand and welcome sexual and gender diversity, following the two-year development of a new DEI strategy.\n\nIn the US, MAM is engaging with American Electric Power (AEP) - one of America's largest power companies - on how it is supporting communities affected by coal plant shutdowns. A portfolio investment of several MAM Public Investments funds, AEP is working towards a just transition for those affected by its move to net zero, ensuring it is an inclusive process that generates new jobs and reduces inequality.\n\nAs a shareholder in over 1,000 stocks globally, the Macquarie Systematic Investments team within MAM is taking a data-driven approach to modern slavery risk. Through direct engagement with companies, the team is able to improve the quality of investment data and encourage improved transparency and disclosures, while identifying those that require closer monitoring and further engagement to track their progress.\n\nIn Australia, BFS continues to invest in new safety and security technology, such as the Macquarie Authenticator app, a market-leading multi-factor authentication tool that provides banking customers with real-time account security alerts and notifications.\n\n## Driving social impact around the world\n\nThe Macquarie Group Foundation (The Foundation) drives philanthropic social impact work for Macquarie, supporting our people, businesses and communities to build a better future.\n\nDuring FY2024, $A67 million was contributed to 3,000 non-profits around the world through employee donations and fundraising, Foundation matching and donations, grants and social impact investments, marking a significant increase on FY2023 and a record year of giving. This includes a record $A10 million raised by the 10th annual Foundation Week, during which our people organised\n\nor participated in over 320 charitable initiatives, spanning 42 offices in 25 markets and supporting more than 240 non-profits globally.\n\nBy partnering with Macquarie businesses, the Foundation helps integrate a shared value approach into existing business models and identify projects that can deliver both increased social value and enhanced commercial outcomes. Catalysing this work, the Macquarie Shared Value Award recognises a team driving social impact through a shared value project. The 2023 winner was a project managed by Macquarie Capital in the Americas - to develop major bridges in Pennsylvania while also deploying an enduring workforce development initiative. Philadelphia Works, the non-profit involved in the project, was awarded a $A100,000 grant to help increase the scope and scale of social impact.\n\nDuring the year, World YMCA - whose vision is empowering young people and communities worldwide to build a just, sustainable, equitable and inclusive world - became the Foundation's second global grant partner. Grant funding will support pilot interventions that use digital solutions and innovative financing to move historically underserved young people beyond skilling and into work.\n\nNew social impact investments were also announced, including one to US-based Pursuit which received a philanthropic grant and a social impact investment. These two complementary forms of catalytic capital will enable Pursuit to scale its impact supporting low-income individuals without a college degree into long-term careers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result was down 47% on the prior year, which was characterised by exceptionally strong market volatility, particularly in commodities.\n\nCommodities contribution was down on the prior year due to decreased risk management income primarily in EMEA Gas and Power, and Resources. The decrease was partially offset by an increased contribution from Agricultural markets. Inventory management and trading income substantially lower driven by a reduction in trading activity primarily in North American Gas and Power, partially offset by timing of income recognition on Gas and Power transport and storage contracts.\n\nFinancial Markets contribution was up on the prior year, driven by increased client hedging activity across foreign exchange and interest rate products and an increased contribution from the Futures business.\n\nAsset Finance contribution was down on prior year, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, notwithstanding strong origination and portfolio growth in Advanced Technology and Shipping Finance.\n\nCGM continues to be recognised across the industries it operates in, with a number of awards earned during the period including House of the Year for Oil and Products, Electricity and Commodities Research at the Energy Risk Awards 2023 and House of the Year for Commodities Research, Derivatives, Environmental Products, Commodity Trade Finance, Natural Gas/LNG and Emissions at the Energy Risk Asia Awards 2023.

We offer our teams significant operating freedom balanced by limits on risk. Alignment of interests is a longstanding feature, demonstrated by willingness to both invest alongside clients and closely align the interests of shareholders and staff.\n\nThis approach has helped us to grow into a diversified global business, conducting a broad range of activities and creating enduring franchises where we have differentiated perspectives. Our approach has not been to place big bets, but to expand adjacently, taking learnings from one market to another, or using expertise built in one part of a sector to grow into another.\n\nThis philosophy is reflected in our flexible approach to allocating capital. We rely on our teams who are close to their markets and clients to drive ideas, setting out both the opportunity they have identified but also the associated risks and how they plan to manage them, with the teams in the business remaining accountable for the long-term outcomes they deliver. Teams at the centre of the organisation assess the case being made, including second line review of risks, before allocating capital with a view to maintaining diversification across our activities

Macquarie's approach to maintaining a sound risk culture is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 setting behavioural expectations\n- \u00b7 leading and executing\n- \u00b7 monitoring, measuring and reporting.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all internal or external sources of material risk.\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG.\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management adopts the 'three lines of defence' model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities functionally independent from oversight and assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 primary responsibility for day-to-day risk management lies with the business\n- \u00b7 RMG forms the second line of defence\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to the Risk Management section of this Annual Report for details on Macquarie's risk management framework, risk culture and conduct risk management\n\n## Macroeconomic factors\n\nThe key macroeconomic risks to Macquarie's short and medium term financial outlook noted on page 32 are:\n\n## Market conditions\n\nThe general condition of markets, driven by macroeconomic, climate and geopolitical factors, may have a bearing on Macquarie's businesses. Changing market conditions influence the volume and timing of client and principal transactions across businesses and the value of various equity, credit and market risk exposures held by Macquarie on its balance sheet.\n\n## The value of the Australian dollar\n\nA significant proportion of Macquarie's net income is denominated in foreign currency. Therefore, net income will be lower in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar appreciates against other foreign currencies, and net income will be higher in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar depreciates against other foreign currencies.\n\n## Potential regulatory changes\n\nMacquarie is affected by changes in regulation. Regulatory change continues to increase at both the global and Australian levels and has the potential to affect the regulatory capital and funding requirements and profitability of Macquarie's businesses.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nMacquarie uses deposits and debt markets, among other funding sources, to fund its assets. Macquarie is therefore exposed to the risk of an increase in the cost of funding, or of reduced access to funding sources.\n\n## Technology\n\nMacquarie recognises that with the use of systems, technology, and platforms to support its business activities, it is exposed to risk of loss resulting from failure, inadequacy or misuse of technology and technology resources.\n\nIn determining those risks that are material to Macquarie, we assess the potential for a risk to affect our earnings resilience and financial strength across market cycles; our ability to meet regulatory obligations; our stakeholders; and our reputation. Macquarie's material risks include asset, conduct, country, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational, regulatory and compliance, strategic, tax, technology and cyber, and work health and safety risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the management of these material risks are available at macquarie.com/riskmanagement",

        "page_content": "About\n\nGovernance\n\n## Macquarie Bank\n\nMacquarie Bank Limited (MBL) is a regulated authorised deposit-taking institution in Australia and is a key subsidiary of MGL. It has a similar governance structure to MGL, with five standing MBL Board Committees: a Board Audit, Board Remuneration, Board Risk, Board Governance and Compliance and Board Conflicts Committee. In addition to supporting the MGL Board, the MGL Board Nominating Committee supports the MBL Board in satisfying itself that the MBL Board has an appropriate mix of skills, experience, tenure and diversity for the Board.\n\nThe MBL Board is comprised of a majority of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), the MGL CEO and MBL CEO. Following the retirement of Mr Michael Coleman, expected by mid-2024, there will be three Bank-only Non-Executive Directors (BONDs) on the MBL Board: Mr Wayne Byres, Mr Ian Saines and Mr David Whiteing, and seven NEDs who also serve on the MGL Board.\n\nThe MBL CEO is assisted by MBL's management committees and the MBL CEO's Office.\n\nDuring FY2024, Macquarie and MBL continued their oversight of ongoing programs that focus on strengthening MBL's processes and controls, including those around intra-group funding arrangements and internal exposures; capital and liquidity reporting; risk management frameworks; and accountabilities and governance. A number of these programs also form part of a remediation plan with APRA, which has been established to define and deliver detailed programs of work that enhance MBL's governance, risk culture, group structure, and remuneration to ensure full and ongoing compliance with prudential standards and management of MBL-specific risks.\n\nAs part of governance changes to better protect the interests of MBL within Macquarie, BOND representation on the MBL Board and MBL Board Committees increased following the new BOND appointments of Mr Whiteing and Mr Byres during FY2024.\n\n## Board oversight\n\nThe Board sets the 'tone at the top' in a highly visible manner. Board members have broad contact with staff at various levels within the organisation and across regions.\n\nThere is a culture of open and frank discussion at the Board. Actions taken by the Board seek to promote long-term sustainability and prudent management of risk consistent with What We Stand For.\n\nBoard workshops scheduled during FY2024 covered topical, emerging business and governance issues, including presentations on data ethics, operational risk management, risk appetite, sustainability reporting, whistleblower training, anti-bribery and corruption and sanctions compliance and cyber threat intelligence.\n\nNEDs also met regularly without members of management and Board Committees held private meetings with each of the external auditor, Head of Internal Audit, Head of Compliance and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to assist with their oversight role.\n\nBoard members believe that informal conversations with staff are important in assessing the culture within Macquarie and seeing Macquarie's purpose at work. Board members generally attend various staff functions in Australia and conduct two international trips to Macquarie offices each year. In FY2024, the Board visited Macquarie offices in the US, UK and France. Key highlights from these visits included visits to certain Macquarie fund assets in London and New York and presentations from regional staff and external speakers about topical issues in the region; regional business updates; and Macquarie's people, culture, and purpose statement in practice. Each visit brought together staff from various locations within the regions, increasing and enhancing the Board's opportunity for engagement with staff. During the US Board visit, Board members engaged with approximately 650 staff members across all levels of seniority in three key regional hubs: Jacksonville, Philadelphia and New York. During the visit to London and Paris, approximately 211 staff members were invited to engage with Board members at various events, including a staff dinner.",

In accordance with the Constitution, the Board has resolved that the maximum number of Voting Directors (Directors) is currently 12.\n\nThe Board Charter details the Board's role and responsibilities and matters expressly reserved for the Board, which include annually approving the strategy and business plan, adopting an annual budget, approving Macquarie's funding and capital management strategy, approving Macquarie's Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Management Strategy , monitoring material risks faced by Macquarie and how they are managed, appointing the CEO and approving major group policies including those relating to remuneration, diversity and equity, and the Code of Conduct .\n\nThe role of the Board is to promote the long-term interests of Macquarie, taking into account Macquarie's specific and broader responsibilities to its shareholders, funders, clients, employees and the communities in which it operates. The Board is assisted by its various Board Committees as detailed in each Board Committee Charter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMGL's Constitution and Board Charter are available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\nThe Board determines delegations to management and approves applicable limits and policies.\n\nThe CEO has been granted authority for matters not reserved for the Board at law or as set out in the Board's Charter, for a Board Committee or one or more other Directors. Macquarie's management committees assist in the exercise of the CEO's delegated authority. The CEO, the CRO and the CFO report to the Board at each meeting. In addition to regular reporting from management, the Board has unrestricted access to senior management and external advisers.\n\nThe Company Secretary is appointed by and accountable to the Board, through the Chair, for matters relating to the proper functioning of the Board.\n\n## Board renewal, appointment and performance\n\nThe Board, with the assistance of the BNC, regularly assesses the skills, experience, tenure and diversity required collectively for the Board to effectively fulfil its role. MGL's Policy on Board Renewal, Appointment of Directors and Board Performance Review sets out the fundamental factors relevant to the selection and appointment of new Directors and the process for assessing performance of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMGL's Policy on Board Renewal, Appointment of Directors and Board Performance Review is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## Board diversity and tenure\n\nThe Board believes that its membership should comprise Directors with an appropriate mix and diversity of skills, professional experience, tenure, gender and personal background. The general expectation is that NEDs will serve three 3-year terms from first election by shareholders. NEDs may serve for longer than three 3-year terms if the Board considers it to be of significant benefit to MGL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy stand for election at the first AGM following their appointment. The notice of meeting provides shareholders with material information relevant to a decision as to whether to elect or re-elect a Director including their skills, experience, other directorships and an acknowledgement that they will have sufficient time to fulfil their responsibilities as a Director.\n\nAll Directors have received an appointment letter setting out the terms of their appointment. The material terms of appointment are set out in MGL's Policy on Board Renewal, Appointment of Directors and Board Performance Review .\n\nNew Directors also undertake an induction program covering relevant matters such as Board and Board Committee practices and procedures, prudential requirements and briefings with Heads of Operating and Central Service Groups and other staff.\n\nNEDs identify business awareness needs on an ongoing basis and regular Board workshops are held during the year on topical, emerging business and governance issues relevant to Macquarie. The BRiC, including at regular meetings of the Chairs of the Board and Board Committees, reviews the annual schedule of Board workshop sessions. In addition to workshops, the Board has generally scheduled two separate visits to international Macquarie offices annually.\n\nThe BNC reviews the skills and experience of the NEDs. As part of the Board performance review, the Board periodically considers whether there is a need for existing Directors to undertake professional development to maintain the skills and knowledge needed to perform their role on the Board effectively.\n\n## Board performance\n\nA Director's continuing Board membership is subject to their performance and ongoing relevance of their skills and experience. The Board undertakes a formal annual performance evaluation to review its performance and the performance of each Director with emphasis on those individual Directors who are required to stand for re-election at the next AGM. The Board considers the performance and skills of Directors standing for re-election and whether other particular skills or experience not currently available are needed prior to determining whether to recommend their re-election to shareholders.\n\nEvery three years an external facilitator conducts the Board's performance review. In the intervening years, an internal performance assessment is led by the Chair with the support of the Company Secretary. The process for conducting the review is agreed by the Board. Typically, the process includes individual interviews by the Chair or an external facilitator with each Director and the use of a self-assessment questionnaire to cover matters such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the Board's contribution to developing strategy\n- \u00b7 the Board's performance relative to its objectives\n- \u00b7 interaction between the Board and management and between Board members\n- \u00b7 the Board's oversight of business performance and risk management\n- \u00b7 Board composition and renewal, including consideration of relevant skills and capabilities\n- \u00b7 the operation of the Board, including the conduct of Board meetings, Board culture and Chair leadership\n- \u00b7 stakeholder management\n- \u00b7 succession and remuneration.\n\nA written report summarising the results and feedback (e.g., with themes in FY2024 relating to time allocation, board composition and board operations) is presented to the Board and discussed at a Board meeting. A nominated Independent Director or the external facilitator provides performance feedback to the Chair based on discussion with the other Directors.\n\nThe Board's review in FY2024 was conducted internally in accordance with the process described above. The FY2025 review is an external review.\n\n## Board Committee performance\n\nAs part of the Board's annual performance evaluation, the functioning and performance of the Board Committees is reviewed. Each Board Committee also undertakes a more detailed review, at least biennially, of its performance and the extent to which it has met its responsibilities set out in its Charter. The process for the review of Board Committee performance also includes use of a self-assessment questionnaire to cover matters such as interaction between the Board Committee and management, the operation of the Board Committee, including the conduct of Board Committee meetings, Board Committee culture and Chair leadership, and Board Committee composition. A written report summarising the results and outcomes, including recommendations, is reviewed and discussed by each Board Committee, led by the Committee Chair.\n\nDuring FY2024, each Board Committee undertook its biennial performance review internally, in accordance with the process described above. The next biennial review is scheduled for FY2026.",

In doing so, the BNC has regard to the results of the annual appraisal of the Board's performance, the performance of each Director and ongoing succession planning.\n\nThe Board comprises highly experienced senior business leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds who each meet the fundamental requirements and, collectively, possess the skills, experience, tenure and diversity considered necessary to appropriately govern an ASX-listed, global, diversified financial group.\n\nThe BNC also considers the necessary and desirable competencies of new MBL directors. For example, through the appointment of additional BONDs in FY2024, the MBL Board increased the number of directors with skills in technology, digital and financial services regulation. These skills complement those of both the MGL and MBL Boards.\n\nFrom time to time there are areas identified by the Board where additional knowledge would be beneficial, which it addresses by engaging external advisers, conducting site visits, Board workshops and/or requesting more detailed reporting from management. Sustainability reporting, data ethics and cyber threat intelligence and generative AI (artificial intelligence) are examples where this approach has been taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of the Directors' qualifications and experience are contained on pages 96 to 100 in the Directors' Report of this Annual Report.",

MGL's NEDs meet regularly in the absence of management and Directors are also able to consult independent experts at MGL's expense, subject to the estimated costs being approved by the Chair in advance as being reasonable. The Board Charter requires that the Board has a majority of NEDs who satisfy MGL's criteria for independence.\n\nThe independence of NEDs is assessed prior to appointment and reviewed annually by the BGCC. The Board believes that independence is evidenced by an ability to constructively challenge and independently contribute to the work of the Board. MGL's criteria for assessing director independence align with the guidance provided in the 4th edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMGL's Policy on Director Independence is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## 88% 100%\n\nof Board members are Independent Directors\n\nof Board Committee members are Independent Directors\n\nThe findings of the annual review of Director independence by the BGCC are considered by the Board. As part of the review, MGL's criteria for assessing director independence are sent to each Independent Director. They are requested to confirm whether they have any interests, positions or relationships with Macquarie that could materially interfere with the Director's capacity to bring independent judgement on matters before the Board and act in the best interests of MGL. This year, there were no material or substantial relationships that were assessed as impacting on the independent judgement of MGL's NEDs. Some of the Directors hold positions in companies with which Macquarie has commercial relationships. All these dealings are not material and are in the ordinary course of business on arm's length commercial terms.\n\n## Dealing with potential conflicts of interest\n\nMacquarie recognises that conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest may arise from time to time for its Directors. Macquarie has in place procedures to identify and monitor for such conflicts and to adopt appropriate measures where these arise.\n\nThe Board has protocols for its members for declaring and dealing with potential conflicts of interest that include:\n\n- \u00b7 Board members declaring their interests required under the Act, the ASX Listing Rules and general law requirements\n- \u00b7 Board members with a material personal interest in a matter before the Board not receiving the relevant Board paper and not being present at the Board meeting during the consideration of the matter and subsequent vote, unless the Board (excluding the relevant Board member) resolves otherwise\n\n- \u00b7 as a general rule, Board members with other conflicts not involving a material personal interest in a matter before the Board should not receive the relevant Board paper and not be present at the Board meeting during discussion of the matter.\n\nMBL is a subsidiary of MGL and all MGL NEDs generally also serve on the MBL Board. The MBL Board is ultimately responsible for the sound and prudent management of MBL, with due consideration to the interests of deposit holders. Where potential conflicts arise, there are a number of measures available to Directors of the relevant Board to deal with such conflicts (e.g., consideration by the MBL Board Conflicts Committee, BOND representation on the MBL Board and Board Committees, etc.). Management will also assist by giving Directors sufficient information to manage conflicts appropriately. Each Director has the ability to obtain independent advice or consult with independent experts where that Director considers it necessary to carry out their duties and responsibilities.\n\n## Culture and values\n\nThe balance between opportunity and accountability, while operating with integrity within a strong risk management framework, is a feature of Macquarie's success and a key factor in our long record of unbroken profitability. Our corporate governance practices reflect this balance.\n\nThe Board approves the Code of Conduct and oversees that the culture instilled by management reflects the principles enshrined within it:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccountability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrity\n\nWe are entrepreneurial. Our people come from diverse backgrounds and are empowered to work together to pursue innovative ideas, to solve problems and challenge conventional thinking and the status quo. We work hard and with enthusiasm and everyone has the opportunity to achieve to their full potential. We have a learning and growth mindset, and continually evolve our expertise. We recognise and reward performance.\n\nWe take pride and ownership of the long-term outcomes we deliver for our clients and shareholders, our communities and each other. We manage risk to ensure these outcomes are sustainable and invest our time and capital to contribute to a better future. We take ownership of the performance of our endeavours and seek to quickly identify and respond to change, emerging issues and trends.\n\nWe operate with care and professionalism. We work collaboratively to amplify our impact and consider the effect of our decisions on others. We have the courage, and are encouraged, to speak up with our ideas, when we make a mistake or see something that doesn't seem right. We respect the law, community expectations, our regulators, shareholders, clients and customers and each other.",

An overview of the key policies that apply to our staff, such as the Whistleblower Policy and Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy , is provided in Macquarie's Code of Conduct . Material incidents and breaches relating to those policies and the Code of Conduct are reported to the Board, typically through the relevant Board Committee.\n\n## Macquarie's Code of Conduct\n\nThe Board approved Code of Conduct , which applies to Macquarie's Independent Directors and staff:\n\n- \u00b7 incorporates What We Stand For : Macquarie's purpose and the principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity that guide the way staff conduct business\n- \u00b7 provides clear guidance on good decision-making and escalation, encouraging staff to speak up and report genuine concerns about improper conduct\n- \u00b7 reinforces the main requirements of Macquarie's key policies.\n\nTo ensure Macquarie's culture of honesty and integrity remains strong throughout the organisation, all staff who join Macquarie receive specific training on What We Stand For and the Code of Conduct. Existing staff also receive periodic training and sign an annual certification that they understand the obligations imposed on them by the Code of Conduct as well as their responsibility to adhere to the Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat We Stand For and the Code of Conduct are available at macquarie.com/wha t-we-stand-for\n\n## The Integrity Office\n\nConsistent with the principles of What We Stand For , Macquarie is committed to providing an environment in which people are comfortable escalating improper conduct or voicing concerns about unethical behaviour. The Code of Conduct sets out the expectation that staff speak up, and outlines the mechanisms, support and protections available to staff who do so.\n\nThe Integrity Office, established in 1998, supports this commitment as an internally independent function dedicated to receiving and investigating concerns about improper conduct or unethical behaviour and protecting those who raise concerns.\n\nMacquarie's Whistleblower Program (Program) provides numerous channels for staff and external parties to confidentially raise concerns about improper conduct, including suspected breaches of the Code of Conduct . The Program, which is managed by the Integrity Office, is supported by the Whistleblower Policy and includes an externally managed service that enables concerns to be raised anonymously. All concerns raised with the Integrity Office or through the externally managed service are assessed and where appropriate, investigated.\n\nThe Integrity Office is also a point of contact for external parties such as suppliers and former employees to raise concerns about improper conduct by Macquarie or its staff.\n\nThe Integrity Office reports directly to MGL's CEO and provides an annual report to the BGCC. Supporting the Group Integrity Officer are Regional Integrity Officers located in various Macquarie offices around the world. The Integrity Office also promotes high ethical standards and good decision-making through communications and engagement with staff.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's Whistleblower Policy is available at macquarie.com/whistleblo wer-policy\n\n## Customer Advocate\n\nMacquarie established the Customer Advocate office in March 2017 to enhance its continuing commitment to its Australian retail and small business customers. In addition to customer support provided by the business, the Customer Advocate's role is to:\n\n- \u00b7 listen to Macquarie's customers and provide a customer-centric voice when making recommendations to improve customer experience\n- \u00b7 minimise the risk of future problems by reviewing key customer themes and new product approvals to identify opportunities to enhance products, services, systems and processes\n- \u00b7 work with Macquarie complaint teams to promote fair and reasonable customer outcomes.\n\nThe Customer Advocate reports directly to the CEO and provides reporting to the BGCC.\n\n## Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy\n\nMacquarie's Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy strictly prohibits the actual or attempted use of any form of bribery or corruption whether direct or indirect and whether involving Public Officials or private persons. Bribery and corruption are incompatible with the Code of Conduct, What We Stand For and the probity and integrity expected of Macquarie's NEDs and staff.\n\nRMG, headed by the CRO, oversees the operation of the policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## Diversity and Community\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nMacquarie recognises that the diversity of its people is one of its greatest strengths and is fundamental to Macquarie's success. An inclusive, equitable workplace enables Macquarie to embrace diversity to deliver more innovation and sustainable solutions for its people, clients, shareholders and communities.\n\nMacquarie's Workforce Diversity Policy defines its diversity commitment and the structures in place to promote:\n\n- \u00b7 a diverse workforce that is reflective of the communities in which Macquarie operates\n- \u00b7 equitable processes that enable staff to reach their full potential, and\n- \u00b7 an inclusive environment where all staff can bring their full selves to work.",

This includes diverse representation at senior leadership levels (Board of Directors, Executive Committee, Division Head and Senior Executive). The principles of equity and inclusion are embedded in Macquarie's people related practices and processes, including core talent programs, talent acquisition processes and promotion criteria, to ensure all staff have access to equitable opportunities.\n\nAll Macquarie staff, including its most senior leaders, are required to have annual DEI objectives, driving accountability from the top down.

The Committee is chaired by Mr Alex Harvey, Chief Financial Officer of Macquarie.\n\nCommittee members bring specific areas of expertise and experience and represent the geographical spread of Macquarie's employees. The Committee meets regularly to assess funding applications, review the Foundation's activities, and to set and monitor strategy.\n\nThe Foundation's Social Impact Investment Advisory Committee (SIIAC) and Macquarie Sports Advisory Committee comprise senior employees with a range of experience from across Macquarie.\n\nAcquisitions for the Macquarie Group Collection are made by an Art Committee, comprising Macquarie employees, together with a curatorial consultant. The Collection has a cohesive integrity and it is the Art Committee's responsibility to uphold this integrity through the acquisition process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information is available on pages 78 to 81 in the Macquarie Group Foundation section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Corporate reporting\n\nPeriodic corporate reports are verified internally by management prior to release to ASX and subject to external audit or review by PwC as required. The verification process allocates disclosures within the relevant document to designated persons to substantiate the disclosures by reference to company source documents or, if no source documents are available, by persons with the knowledge and expertise to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the BAC:\n\n- \u00b7 oversees the quality and integrity of Macquarie's financial reporting and the operation of the financial reporting processes: The processes are aimed at providing assurance that the financial statements and related notes are complete, in accordance with applicable legal requirements and accounting standards and give a true and fair view of Macquarie's financial position and financial performance. During its review of Macquarie's interim and year-end financial reports the BAC meets with the external auditor in the absence of management\n- \u00b7 reviews the external auditor engagement: At least annually, the BAC reviews the terms of the engagement and assesses the performance, quality, expertise, resources and qualifications, objectivity, independence and effectiveness of the external auditor. During FY2024, the BAC oversaw Macquarie's comprehensive review of the external auditor. The governance framework for the external auditor is described on page 48. The BAC at least annually recommends to the Board the continuation of, appointment of a new, or removal of the existing external auditor\n- \u00b7 monitors and reviews the operation of Internal Audit: The BAC monitors and reviews the degree of independence of the Head of Internal Audit, their performance and remuneration (after seeking input from the CRO) and approves their appointment and removal. The BAC also approves the Internal Audit annual plan and monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function\n- \u00b7 reviews the adequacy of Macquarie's control framework for financial regulatory reporting to banking regulators: The BAC receives reports prepared by management that assess the control effectiveness of Macquarie's Operating and Central Services Groups.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nBefore the Board approves the interim and year-end financial reports, the BAC reviews the independence of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\n\nMacquarie's Audit and Assurance Independence Policy sets out the independence requirements Macquarie requires of its auditor. The policy supplements the legal and professional standard requirements applicable to its auditor in each jurisdiction. The policy ensures the independence of the audit firm from MGL, its subsidiaries and Macquarie's managed funds and their controlled portfolio companies.\n\nTo ensure an effective and efficient audit, and to ensure the independence of the auditor, the policy guides the use of a single",

Ms Voula Papageorgiou of PwC replaced Ms Kristin Stubbins as Macquarie's lead auditor in FY2024. Ms Stubbins had been Macquarie's lead auditor since FY2020.\n\nPwC attended the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held during the reporting period and was available to answer questions about the conduct of the audit, and the preparation and content of the auditor's report.\n\nMacquarie's auditor provides a declaration to the BAC at the time of Macquarie's interim and year-end financial reports, that no prohibited non-audit services have been provided. The external auditor is also required to declare in their audit report that they are independent of MGL and its subsidiaries in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Act and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) that are relevant to its audit of the financial report in Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe External Auditor Policy Statement describe key aspects of Macquarie's Audit and Assurance Independence Policy and external auditor review process, and are available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## Review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor's performance\n\nThe BAC conducts an annual review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor, including qualifications, expertise, resources and performance of the external auditor, PwC. In addition to the BAC's annual external auditor review processes, a more detailed comprehensive review of the external auditor will be conducted at least every five years, beginning in FY2024.\n\nThe annual evaluation involves assessing PwC's performance against ASIC's audit quality guidance, obtaining feedback from the Board and senior stakeholders across various Macquarie finance and business teams, and obtaining and reviewing feedback from PwC on the results of any internal or other external audit quality reviews relating to the audit.\n\nThe comprehensive review conducted during FY2024 considered the performance of the audit firm over several years - both at Macquarie and as an audit firm in servicing its clients, its industry expertise, application of professional scepticism, internal quality processes and independence processes. This enhanced periodic review strengthens the governance framework for the external\n\nauditor and helps manage risks relating to the external auditor's independence and effectiveness, which may include the risk of institutional familiarity arising from the external auditor's tenure.\n\nThe outcomes of the annual and comprehensive reviews were presented to and discussed with the BAC, and separately discussed with PwC. Having considered these outcomes, the BAC continues to be satisfied with the audit quality of the auditor.\n\nThe comprehensive review identified opportunities for both the auditor and Macquarie to evolve the audit relationship.\n\nMacquarie has revised its Audit and Assurance Independence Policy to include requirements relating to audit tender, comprehensive review frequency and the provision of tax services, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie will tender the audit of MGL and its subsidiaries every 10 years and require the same of its managed funds and their controlled portfolio companies, where circumstances allow, and Macquarie has the power to require such appointment\n- \u00b7 Macquarie will continue to conduct a comprehensive review of its auditor in the intervening 5-year period with timing aligned to the rotation of the lead audit partner. Macquarie will continue to conduct an annual review of the quality and effectiveness of its auditor which aligns to ASIC's audit quality guidance\n- \u00b7 Other than those tax services required for the audit or assurance of the financial statements, MGL and its subsidiaries will cease the use of its auditor for the provision of tax (including tax compliance) services with effect from 1 April 2025\n- \u00b7 Macquarie has minimal appetite for the provision of tax services by the auditor to MGL and its subsidiaries and to Macquarie's managed funds and their controlled portfolio companies. Any new engagement will require BAC approval, unless:\n- - the managed funds or controlled portfolio companies have an independent executive governance committee or board; and\n- - that entity's auditor independence policy contains equivalent provisions as Macquarie's policy.\n\nIn limited commercial circumstances, and where the independence of the auditor is not impaired, the BAC may consider approving these services on an exceptional basis.\n\nMacquarie expects to tender the audit of MGL, its subsidiaries, and its managed funds no later than mid-2026.\n\nBased on the outcomes of this year's annual and comprehensive reviews, and the auditor's independence confirmations, the BAC recommended to the Board that PwC continue in its role as Macquarie's external auditor.\n\n## Board evaluation and consideration\n\nIn FY2024, the Board exercised its continuing oversight of the performance of the external auditor. Board members provided feedback forming part of the comprehensive review of the external auditor considered by the BAC to assess their effectiveness and service quality.\n\nBased on that assessment, the results of the auditor independence reviews and recommendation of the BAC, in May 2024 the Board agreed that PwC should continue as Macquarie's external auditor.",

Macquarie engages with institutional investors, private investors, sell-side analysts and buy-side analysts throughout the year via scheduled and ad hoc interactions.\n\nAs part of Macquarie's commitment to keep its investor base informed, management presents at various investment conferences and conducts investor visits and meetings (including virtual) throughout the year.\n\nAll material investor or analyst presentations are lodged with ASX ahead of the presentation and made available on Macquarie's website.\n\n## Macquarie's website\n\nRecent announcements, past and current reports to shareholders, including summaries of key financial data, operational briefing presentations, AGM webcasts and copies of recent notices of meeting are available on the investor centre page of our website.

For shareholders who are unable to attend in person, MGL provides a webcast of its AGM and any other general meetings. The results of all resolutions are lodged with ASX as soon as they are available after the meeting.\n\nMGL typically holds its AGM in July each year.\n\nNotices of meeting are accompanied by explanatory notes on the items of business and together they seek to clearly explain the nature of business of the meeting.\n\nIf shareholders are unable to attend the meeting, they are encouraged to vote on the proposed motions by appointing a proxy. The proxy form sent to shareholders explains how to appoint a proxy.

In the interests of attending shareholders, the Chair of the meeting will exercise their powers to ensure the meeting is conducted in an orderly and timely fashion.\n\nMGL's 2023 AGM was held as a hybrid meeting with shareholders able to attend in person or online. Shareholders were provided with various alternatives to participate in the AGM, including by watching the AGM live through a facility that enabled shareholders to vote and to ask questions or make comments online and a dial-in teleconference to listen to the meeting live and to ask questions on the telephone but not vote.\n\n## Shareholder communications\n\nShareholders can elect to receive communications from, and send communications to, MGL and MGL's share registry electronically by visiting the Investor contacts page on Macquarie's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about Macquarie is available at macquarie.com /investors",

The BRiC assists the Board by providing oversight of Macquarie's risk management framework and advising the Board on Macquarie's risk appetite, risk culture and risk management strategy.\n\nThe BRiC constructively challenges management's proposals and decisions on risk management arising from Macquarie's activities. The Board is also assisted by the BAC, BRC and BGCC in its oversight of financial and non-financial risk.\n\nEach year, including FY2024, the Board oversees the operation of Macquarie's risk management framework by management to satisfy itself that the framework continues to be appropriate and that Macquarie is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board. Key components of the framework are reviewed by the relevant Risk Management Group (RMG) divisions and the results are reported to the Board. The Internal Audit Division (IAD) independently and objectively reviews the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's risk management framework at least annually, with coverage of all material elements of the framework over a 3-year period.\n\nThe risk management framework has been established on the premise that a disciplined approach to risk management is best maintained with a single risk management framework that is applied appropriately throughout Macquarie (including the Bank Group). In addition, the Bank Group maintains its own governance structure, which includes the MBL Board and Board Committees, MBL CEO, MBL Executive Committee and other management committees.\n\n## Macquarie's risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie's risk management framework since inception. Macquarie sets, promotes, monitors and reflects on the effectiveness of our risk culture. All staff have a role in managing risk. Ownership of risk, including risk culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC, is responsible for forming a view on Macquarie's risk culture and the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently within its risk appetite. The Board also identifies and monitors any necessary or desirable actions to change the risk culture.\n\n## Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Head of RMG, as Macquarie's CRO, is a member of the Executive Committee and reports directly to the CEO. The CRO has a secondary reporting line to the BRiC, which reviews the performance and objectives of the CRO and approves the appointment and removal of the CRO. The CRO has unfettered access to the Board, the BRiC and its Chair. The BRiC meets with the CRO, in the absence of other management, at least annually to discuss any matters that the BRiC or the CRO believe should be discussed privately. The CRO reports risk matters at the BRiC meetings. Where there is no scheduled BRiC meeting, the CRO presents risk matters at a Board meeting.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe IAD provides independent and objective risk-based assurance to the BAC, Board, other relevant Board Committees and Senior Management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework, including its governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for managing material risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe structure of the IAD, and further details of Macquarie's risk management approach, are contained on pages 82 to 88 in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report.",

They are: environmental and social risk management; climate change; environmental and social financing; sustainability in our own business operations; client and customer experience; people and workplace; business conduct and ethics; and community. Building on What We Stand For and the Code of Conduct, these focus areas reflect the risks and opportunities identified by the business and the issues of interest to our stakeholders.\n\nEnvironmental and social risks have been identified as material risk events within Macquarie's risk management framework, while climate change and net zero transition are incorporated as causal risks under External Risk and Strategic/Business Risk, respectively, within Macquarie's risk management framework.\n\nInformation on Macquarie's management of environmental and social risks, including climate-related, nature-related, and human rights risks, are provided within the ESG section of this Annual Report. Further details are also available in Macquarie's Net Zero and Climate Risk Report and Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional information is available at macquar ie.com/esg and macquarie.com/riskmanagement\n\n## Oversight of remuneration\n\nMacquarie's longstanding and consistent approach to remuneration continues to support Macquarie's purpose statement, 'Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future'. Staff interests are aligned with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers, while ensuring that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with our remuneration principles and the expectations of stakeholders.\n\nMGL's NEDs oversee management's implementation of Macquarie's remuneration framework. The BRC assists the Board with Macquarie's remuneration policies and practices.\n\n## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nMGL's NEDs are remunerated for their services from the maximum aggregate annual amount approved by shareholders, currently $A5 million. They do not receive payments on their retirement from office other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation contributions comprising part of their remuneration, if any.\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with shareholders, NEDs are required to have a meaningful direct shareholding in MGL. Unlike Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity nor are they eligible to receive profit share payments.\n\nThe Board minimum shareholding requirement for:\n\n- \u00b7 NEDs other than the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one times the average annual NED fee for the financial year ended prior to their appointment\n- \u00b7 the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one times the annual Chair fee\n\nwith the minimum number of shares to be acquired by NEDs determined using the share price as at the date of appointment.\n\nThe above requirements apply to MGL's NEDs and are to be met within three years from appointment with one third of the requirement to be held after one year, two thirds after two years and in full after three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach NED's current Macquarie shareholding is set out in the Key Management Personnel disclosure on page 150 in the Remuneration Report of this Annual Report.\n\n## Executive remuneration\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework has been a key driver of our sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term, taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk management, customer, economic and reputational outcomes. This approach has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue to attract, motivate and retain exceptional and entrepreneurial people with deep industry expertise across the 34 markets in which we operate. It is characterised by an emphasis on performance-based remuneration, profit share determined based on a range of financial and non-financial factors and retaining a significant proportion of performance-based remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period.\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework works as an integrated whole. An individual's remuneration comprises fixed remuneration, profit share and, for Executive Committee members (our Executive Key Management Personnel (Executive KMP)), Performance Share Units. Macquarie retains a percentage of each individuals' annual profit share allocation (retained profit share) above a certain threshold. This is invested in a combination of Macquarie ordinary shares under the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan and Macquarie-managed fund equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of Macquarie's approach and the amount of remuneration paid to NEDs and Executive KMP are contained on pages 106 to 156 in the Remuneration Report of this Annual Report.",

Failure to effectively manage these risks could result in harm to communities, the environment and other external parties, and expose the organisation to regulatory, reputational and financial impacts.\n\n## Climate change (see page 59)\n\nMacquarie's approach to climate is based around four areas of action. This includes: reducing the emissions of our own business operations; leveraging our knowledge to help others decarbonise; aligning our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050; and increasing investment in climate mitigation and adaption solutions.\n\n## Environmental and social financing (see page 62)\n\nAcross our Operating Groups, Macquarie is supporting a range of activities under the following broad categories: financing and developing; advising; managing; researching and trading.\n\n## Sustainability in our own business operations (see page 65)\n\nThe environmental and social impacts of Macquarie's own business operations predominantly relate to the energy and resources we consume in our offices and data centres, business travel, and our procurement activities. We seek to manage these impacts by monitoring and reducing our operational emissions, developing innovative and sustainable workplaces, being efficient with energy and resource use, and improving the sustainability and diversity of our supply chain.\n\n## Client and customer experience (see page 69)\n\nMacquarie's relationships with our clients and customers, and their trust in us, is central to our business and future success.

We regularly engage with a broad range of stakeholders including clients, customers, shareholders, investors, analysts, governments, regulators, employees, suppliers and the wider community.\n\nOur engagement with stakeholders helps identify and validate our ESG focus areas.\n\n## Materiality process\n\nWe refer to the approach of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to determine our ESG focus areas. This involves:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding the organisation's context: gathering and analysing data and information from a broad range of external and internal sources to better understand the context in which we operate\n- \u00b7 identifying negative and positive, actual and potential impacts and assessing their significance: analysing direct external stakeholder feedback and engaging across our Operating and Central Service Groups to identify impacts, generate a real-world perspective of stakeholder priorities and evaluate the relative importance of material ESG topics across our activities\n- \u00b7 prioritising the most significant impacts for reporting : utilising inputs from our research and engagement to determine the most material impacts to report\n- \u00b7 validating our ESG focus areas and material ESG topics: testing our material ESG topics with internal stakeholders and against external standards and market expectations.\n\n## ESG focus areas\n\nThe ESG topics identified during the FY2024 materiality process were the same as those identified in FY2023. As a result, our eight overarching ESG focus areas remain unchanged.\n\n| ESG focus areas                                               | ESG topics (1)                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Environmental  and social risk  management  (pages 56)        | \u00b7 Integration of environmental and social risk  (ESR) factors in decision-making \u00b7 Climate change \u00b7 Human rights \u00b7 Nature and biodiversity  \u00b7 Work health and safety (WHS) and wellbeing |\n| Climate change  (pages 59)                                    | \u00b7 Climate change \u00b7 Net zero                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Environmental  and social   financing (pages 62)              | \u00b7 Pursuing investments, markets and products  with an ESG focus                                                                                                                          |\n| Sustainability in  our own business  operations  (pages 65)   | \u00b7 Management of environmental and social  issues in our own business operations \u00b7 Human rights                                                                                           |\n| People and  workplace                                         | \u00b7 Transparent information and fair advice  and dealing \u00b7 Talent attraction and development Remuneration WHS and wellbeing                                                                |\n| Client and customer  Business conduct  and ethics  (pages 72) | Client and customer satisfaction \u00b7 \u00b7                                                                                                                                                     |\n| experience  (pages 69)                                        | \u00b7 \u00b7 Financial crime \u00b7 Innovation and digitalisation                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                                               | Risk culture and conduct Taxation Political contributions                                                                                                                                |\n|                                                               | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Information security and data privacy Financial crime                                                                                                                              |\n|                                                               | Human rights \u00b7 Diversity, equity and inclusion - refer to  pages 74-77 in the Diversity, Equity and  Inclusion section of this Annual Report                                             |\n| (pages 78)                                                    | \u00b7 Social impact - refer to pages 78-81 in the  Macquarie Group Foundation section of this  Annual Report                                                                                 |\n|                                                               | Management of legal and regulatory                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                                                               | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 environment                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| (pages 71)                                                    | \u00b7                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Community                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details are available at macquar ie.com/esg",

During the year, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published the following sustainability reporting standards:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS S1 General Requirements of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1) , which sets out the overall requirements for sustainability-related financial disclosures; and\n- \u00b7 IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2), which will require the disclosure of information that enables the users of financial statements to understand the reporting entity's governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn Australia, the proposed sustainability standards have been issued for exposure and comment while proposed legislation has been tabled in Parliament under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 (Cth) . In the present form, these requirements would have the MGL Consolidated Entity commence reporting for its FY2026 financial year. Macquarie acknowledges the growing importance of sustainability-related disclosures and continues to progress its established project to assess and prepare for future sustainability and climate-related reporting obligations.\n\n## Independent assurance\n\nPwC has provided limited assurance over select ESG metrics for the FY2024 reporting period, as detailed in the PwC independent assurance report available within Macquarie's FY2024 Basis of Preparation for ESG Reporting on our website. This also sets out the reporting boundaries, metric definitions and measurement methodologies for the assured metrics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's FY2024 Basis of Preparation for ESG Reporting, FY2024 independent limited assurance report and FY2024 GRI Index and SASB Index tables can be downloaded from macquar ie.com/esg",

They are supported by the Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) team.\n\nThe ESR team coordinates a diverse range of ESG activities across Macquarie, including developing and implementing company-wide and business-specific policies, reviewing transactions, providing advice on environmental and social risks and opportunities and facilitating training. The ESR team provides six-monthly reports to the CRO and BGCC on environmental and social risk management policies, practices and performance.\n\nDetails on Macquarie's approach to assessing and managing its material risks, and our broader risk management framework are included on pages 82-88 in the Risk management section of this Annual Report.\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are managed through the implementation of the ESR and WHS policies. These are updated periodically to address opportunities for improvement and emerging issues.\n\nMacquarie's ESR Policy describes our approach to ESR management when onboarding or reviewing clients and other counterparties and across a broad range of transactions including equity investments, financing, leasing and advisory mandates. The ESR Policy provides a process to assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report environmental and social risks and takes a precautionary approach to ESR issues including labour and employment practices, climate change, human rights, resource efficiency, pollution prevention, biodiversity and cultural heritage. Guided by international guidelines, including the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, the ESR Policy provides escalated decision-making and approval processes, alongside the credit and broader RMG approval processes, for material environmental and social risks. Transactions with material environmental and social risks are referred to the CRO and may be escalated to the CEO or at least two Non-Executive Directors of the Board.\n\n## 864\n\n961\n\nattendances at ESR and WHS training sessions in FY2024 (2)\n\nreviews completed under the ESR Policy in FY2024 (3)\n\n## Reviews completed under the ESR Policy in FY2024\n\n(4)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's WHS Policy describes our approach to recognise, support and promote the rights of every worker throughout our global operations and investment activities. The WHS Policy outlines how we apply our WHS risk management principles for: Macquarie's day-to-day operations and potential impacts to our people, third-party suppliers and visitors to Macquarie premises; product and services provided to our clients; and investments in businesses or projects by Macquarie or on behalf of third-party investors.\n\n- (2) Includes risk managers and those in specific business groups with greatest potential exposure to environmental, social and WHS risks. Excludes global online WHS training completions. Some employees may have attended more than one training session, in which case their attendance was counted for each session.\n- (3) PwC has provided limited assurance over this metric as detailed in the PwC independent assurance report available within Macquarie's FY2024 Basis of Preparation for ESG Reporting.

Macquarie considers the risks of climate change (climate risk) to be cross-cutting, meaning we recognise climate risk may impact a broad range of material risks within our risk management framework as detailed on pages 82-88 in the Risk management section of this Annual Report. Macquarie continues to embed and enhance the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and reporting of climate risks across the risk management framework.\n\n## Human rights\n\nMacquarie respects fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and core International Labour Organization Conventions.\n\nMacquarie has a company-wide framework of polices and processes in place to identify, prevent or mitigate and, where relevant, remediate potential and actual human rights impacts, including modern slavery, resulting from our business activities and the relationships connected to those activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's Modern Slavery Statement can be downloaded from macquarie.com/huma n-rights-at-macquarie\n\n## Nature and biodiversity\n\nMacquarie recognises that nature-related risks, such as biodiversity loss, can have material economic, social and environmental implications.\n\nWe have no tolerance for breaches of environmental and social laws and regulations. We seek to comply with recognised international standards to ensure that our business activities limit harm to the environment. We seek to make a positive contribution to environmental performance, including considering our direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on resource efficiency and pollution prevention, biodiversity and natural resource management, and environmentally sensitive or protected areas.\n\nDuring FY2024, Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) continued to support the development of frameworks to identify, measure and disclose nature-related risk and impacts as a founding member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). Furthermore, Macquarie participated in a pilot study sponsored by the Australian Government's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to obtain a better understanding of the challenges, barriers and opportunities for Australian organisations in preparing for the adoption of the TNFD framework.\n\n## Work health and safety, and wellbeing\n\nAt Macquarie we are committed to providing safe workplaces where our employees, contractors and visitors can work and collaborate without risk of physical and psychological harm.\n\nMacquarie's WHS vision, 'Safe workplaces that enable and empower people to do their best work', is designed in connection with our purpose of 'Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future'. Our strong culture of leadership, governance and assurance is integral to how we do this.\n\nOur WHS practices are supported by:\n\n- \u00b7 clear expectations and behaviours agreed with Macquarie employees, contractors, visitors and business partners\n- \u00b7 incorporation of WHS into our investment and business decision-making processes\n- \u00b7 WHS management frameworks and controls to: manage safety-critical risks effectively; comply with laws, regulatory obligations and standards; select, contract with and govern third-party suppliers; and enable effective consultation and communication of relevant WHS matters and information\n- \u00b7 sufficient resourcing to manage material WHS risks\n- \u00b7 measuring, monitoring and managing the progress of our WHS performance to achieve our WHS vision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContinued integration of work health and safety into the investment lifecycle and tailored Safety Alignment Frameworks across all Macquarie Operating Groups\n\n## Health, safety and wellbeing of our people\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of all our people is at the centre of Macquarie's vision to create a healthy and safe environment by identifying, preventing, and managing work-related physical and psychosocial risks.\n\nOur people are provided with opportunities to engage in health and safety forums and consultation committees to address local and regional WHS matters. This input assists in shaping our focus for future wellbeing initiatives and strategies for injury and illness prevention and management.",

(5) In FY2024, 99% of our people completed global online Conduct at Macquarie training, including managing and responding to psychosocial risks and expected standards of behaviour relating to sexual harassment.\n\n## Health and safety in our investments\n\nMacquarie integrates WHS into the investment lifecycle from due diligence prior to investment, through to divestment. We believe there is a strong correlation between actively managing WHS risk and improving investment returns. This includes identifying WHS risks and improvement opportunities at acquisition, if necessary establishing transition plans in agreement with shareholders and assets, and monitoring investments' WHS performance throughout the investment lifecycle.\n\nMacquarie's Operating Groups have tailored Safety Alignment Frameworks to address the specific WHS risk profiles within our investments. Frameworks are regularly reviewed and enhanced to drive consistent WHS governing principles and expectations for equity and fund management portfolio companies, seeking to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries. In FY2024, 205 Macquarie Nominee Directors received WHS governance training and are supported by a network of senior WHS professionals.\n\nWHS is the responsibility of each portfolio company. The portfolio company board oversees the management of WHS and regularly monitors and reports on WHS performance and risk management to Macquarie, including high potential near miss reporting and outcomes of incident investigations where there was a fatality or serious injury.\n\nDuring FY2024, Macquarie increased its focus on critical safety risk management with the identification of high-risk sectors and industries based on our investment insights, including the introduction of additional WHS performance metrics. Macquarie continues to focus on implementing WHS leading practices, improvement initiatives, ensuring adequate WHS resources are in place, updating WHS performance metrics and sharing lessons learnt across our regions and Operating Groups. This also includes Macquarie regularly promoting intra-industry WHS forums to share lessons between organisations and across regions. In FY2024, 19 safety alerts and lessons were shared across our organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information, including examples of how we put WHS into practice, is available at macquar ie.com/esg",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nAt Macquarie, our approach to addressing climate challenges is rooted in our purpose of 'Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future'.\n\nWe believe we can contribute most positively to the challenges and opportunities of climate change mitigation and adaptation through the financing of practical solutions driven by the core capabilities of our teams. Over the course of FY2024, we continued to drive additional capacity in established clean energy technologies, while also investing in emerging technologies that seek to reduce emissions across energy, transportation, land use, buildings, waste and industrial processes.\n\nWhile our fossil fuel financed emissions (6) remain relatively small compared to global peers, we continue to believe that an effective transition must be managed, orderly and just. Consistent with that philosophy, and in recognition that much of the world will depend on the oil/gas industries for years to come, we are working with our oil/gas clients to help them reduce their emissions as well as maintain sufficient energy supply. In addition, our commodity trading activities are helping clients manage their transition risks by maintaining and developing deep and liquid hedging markets, including in emerging commodities essential to the transition, thereby providing greater price certainty as they navigate this historic transformation.\n\n## Macquarie's approach to climate is based around four areas of action\n\nThe climate strategy set out in our 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report is based around four areas of action:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nContinue to reduce the emissions of our own business operations\n\nLeverage our knowledge and networks to help others decarbonise\n\nAlign our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050\n\nIncrease investment in climate mitigation and adaptation solutions\n\nSeparately to Macquarie's direct financing activities, MAM has made a commitment to invest and manage its portfolio in line with global net zero Scope 1 and 2 financed greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, where it has control or significant influence. (7) Where MAM does not have control or significant influence, such as in its managed portfolio of public securities, it will continue to support the goals of the Paris Agreement (8) in a manner consistent with its client-guided fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities. Further details on MAM's net zero commitment can be found on the MAM website.\n\n## 1. Continue to reduce the emissions of our own business operations\n\nWe have committed to net zero emissions in our own business operations across Scope 1 and 2 by FY2025 and are progressing well towards achieving this. As part of this commitment, we are aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a FY2020 baseline, including purchasing renewable electricity for our office premises in line with our RE100 commitment. We are continuing to purchase carbon credits to offset residual Scope 1 emissions that are difficult to abate, and we continue to offset our Scope 3 Category 6: Business travel emissions.

Align our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050\n\nA key aspect of Macquarie's climate strategy is prioritising efforts to reduce financed emissions in carbon-intensive sectors, to help set a path for the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050. We have estimated our financed emissions and set interim targets for the residential mortgage, oil/gas, motor vehicle and coal sectors:\n\n- \u00b7 for residential mortgages we have set a 2030 interim target of 11.6 -19.3 kgCO2e/m 2 for Scope 1 and 2 which implies a 50-70% reduction in physical emissions intensity from the FY2021 baseline\n- \u00b7 for oil/gas we are making progress towards our 2030 interim target of 56.3-59.6 gCO2e/MJ for Scope 1, 2 and 3 which implies a 9-14% reduction in physical emissions intensity from the FY2020 baseline\n- \u00b7 for motor vehicles we had set a 2030 interim target of 147 gCO2e/km for Scope 1 and 2 which implies a 34% reduction in physical emissions intensity from the FY2020 baseline. BFS no longer originates new car loans and finance leases and the interim target when adopted had assumed that this business was ongoing. Our physical emissions intensity for this portfolio will be determined by the remaining vehicle mix as loans and leases run-off\n- \u00b7 for coal, we are on track to run-off our remaining on-balance sheet lending and equity exposures to the coal sector by the end of 2024. (10)\n\nWe now have targets in place for over 80% of our dollar exposures to carbon-intensive sectors and, in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines for Climate Target Setting - Supporting notes (Guidelines), we will outline our approach to all remaining material carbon-intensive sectors in our next Net Zero and Climate Risk Report. (11),(12) In addition to the four sectors where we have set financed emissions targets, for the first time this year, we reported historical emissions in the power generation sector of 0.75 MtCO2 e for Scope 1. (13)\n\n## Our approach to coal\n\nOur broader approach to coal continues to evolve to reflect the needs of the energy transition and industry practice:\n\n- \u00b7 in 2021 we announced our intention to run-off our limited remaining on-balance sheet lending and equity exposures to coal companies by the end of 2024. (10) This commitment is on track and applies to coal companies in both the mining and coal-fired power generation sectors, and to both metallurgical and thermal coal. At the time of making the 2021 coal commitment, we followed the then standard industry practice of classifying clients as coal companies based on ANZSIC and GICS codes\n- \u00b7 in 2022, based on the NZBA Guidelines, we began defining coal companies based on the proportion of a company's revenue that comes from coal-related activities. Given computational challenges associated with revenue shares (particularly in a world of high and volatile coal prices), we have consistently defined a coal company as one that derives the majority (i.e., more than 50%) of its revenue from coal (both thermal and metallurgical) production, mine ownership or operation, or coal-fired power station ownership or operation. We acknowledge that the 50% threshold is not in line with the NZBA Guidelines, which define a coal company as one that derives more than 5% of revenues directly from thermal coal only\n- \u00b7 separately, Macquarie also committed to not enter into new business activity with any counterparty where the underlying purpose is to fund the purchase, development or expansion of a coal mine or coal-fired power station. Commencing April 2024, we have refined this commitment to note that advisory transactions where the underlying purpose is to fund the purchase, development or expansion of a metallurgical coal mine will be in appetite. (14) This takes into consideration the ongoing importance of metallurgical coal for steel making, the industry's differential treatment of metallurgical and thermal coal, and the short-term nature of advisory relationships. Thermal coal buy-side advisory mandates remain out of appetite\n- \u00b7 the global community has recognised the urgent need to reduce global carbon emissions and the importance of working with carbon intensive industries, such as coal, to help them decarbonise. As noted in our 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report , we will maintain the ability to work with coal companies to finance projects that will significantly reduce their carbon emissions in line with science-based scenarios or are for the purpose of diversifying away from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan.\n\n## 4. Increase investment in climate mitigation and adaptation solutions\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has suggested that annual clean energy investment worldwide will need to increase from $US1.8 trillion in 2023 to $US4.3 trillion by 2030 to put the world on track to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. (15) This will require a collective effort across the private and public sectors. Supporting this need, our businesses are focused on providing solutions to our clients to help them and the communities we serve to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nMore details can be found on pages 62-64 of this Annual Report and on pages 15-16 of the 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report.\n\n(14)\n\nAdvisory transactions are defined as advisory mandates, introducer roles or similar structures, Debt Capital Markets transactions on a best endeavours (non-underwritten) basis\n\nand Equity Capital Markets transactions where there is strong confidence that there is no (or will be no) net underwriting risk exposure post book closure.",

To achieve this, we are focusing on improving energy efficiency within our premises and reducing energy use overall; implementing 100% electrification of our premises; purchasing 100% renewable electricity for our operational requirements; and offsetting any residual emissions in line with industry guidance on the use of credible carbon offsets.\n\nOur FY2024 electricity consumption was 39.9 GWh, which is a decrease of 2% from the previous year and a 38% reduction from the FY2014 baseline. The reduction since FY2014 is the result of the consolidation, relocation, and upgrades of office premises to more sustainable buildings, together with our cloud transformation strategy that enables rationalisation of servers.\n\nFollowing the move into our new global headquarters in Sydney in 2024, we will re-baseline our electricity consumption to reflect the corresponding energy performance.\n\nThis year, Macquarie has sourced the equivalent of 100% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources through a combination of renewable energy from building owners or utilities (47%) and energy attribute certificates (53%). (24)\n\nBased on RE100 boundary criteria, the equivalent of our FY2024 electricity consumption sourced from renewable sources is 98.8%.

We have commenced methodology development and collection of baseline data for employee commuting to support inclusion of this in future business operations Scope 3 inventories.\n\nFor Category 1: Purchased goods and services (which includes Category 2: Capital goods, Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution, and Category 8: Upstream leased assets), emissions have increased 6% from the FY2020 baseline due to an increase in expenditure and a greater proportion of this being for technology services with higher emission factors. For this category, we have a target that by FY2030, suppliers representing 75% of our total supplier related emissions (estimated based on spend) have set a science-based emissions reduction target. (31) We are engaging with our suppliers to understand their climate commitments and transition plans, and making progress toward achieving this target.

This methodology does not take into account any supplier specific emission reduction initiatives. Currently, due to data limitations, this category excludes capital expenditure on the development of our new global headquarters 1 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, due to be completed in 2024.

For FY2024, Macquarie will purchase and retire a portfolio of Australian Carbon Credit Units and other voluntary carbon offsets by 30 June 2024. Leveraging our internal due diligence processes, offset projects are selected based on quality and verifiability of emissions reductions. We have also engaged an independent third-party to assist with the evaluation and selection of suitable offset projects.",

We have a commitment that 80% of our employees will be in sustainably-rated premises by FY2025, and at the end of FY2024, 71% of Macquarie people occupied a sustainably-rated office. (37)\n\n## Our new offices in Sydney and New York\n\nMacquarie is delivering the new Sydney Metro Martin Place integrated station precinct. The precinct includes the new Martin Place metro station, a retail and dining destination, underground pedestrian connections, and two landmark buildings: the 39-storey 1 Elizabeth Street (1 Elizabeth) which, together with 50 Martin Place, will become Macquarie's new global headquarters; and the 28-storey 39 Martin Place.\n\nWhen construction is completed in 2024, the precinct will feature accessible public spaces that are sustainable, maximise the use of natural light, feature native plants and public art, pay respect to the land's traditional owners, and be digitally enabled. Our goal is that this precinct will contribute to the reinvigoration of Martin Place that has been taking place over the past several years.\n\nThe 1 Elizabeth building has achieved a 6 Star Green Star Design Review (Design & As Built) rating, (38) has been designed to be energy efficient, 100% electric in normal operations, and our workplace will be powered by 100% renewable electricity. Throughout the construction and fit-out stages, and as we relocate from other offices, we have focused on reuse of materials, fittings, and furniture.\n\nIn 2024, coinciding with Macquarie's 30th anniversary in New York, our New York office will be relocated to a recently refurbished building at 660 Fifth Avenue and our tenancy will utilise many of the design principles of our new Sydney global headquarters including a 100% electric design.\n\nThe New York project design has achieved a LEED Gold Rating with features such as direct access to natural light and views, multiple outdoor terraces with planting, optimal indoor air quality, and dedicated end-of-trip change room facilities. The project is also being built with materials, and furnished with items, that incorporate reused and sustainable products that have been sourced, moved, and installed with local and diverse-owned businesses.\n\n## Resource efficiency and minimising waste to landfill\n\nWe continue to raise awareness and improve waste recycling rates across our offices. In our Sydney global headquarters and our London office, we diverted 63% of our operational waste from landfill in FY2024 (compared to our 50% target by FY2025). We have diverted 83% of fit-out construction and demolition waste from landfill in the year, exceeding the 70% target for FY2024. (39)\n\nWe have made a FY2025 commitment to eliminate single-use plastic in our premises operations and are making progress towards this by focusing on removing single-use cups, cutlery, and plastic packaging for food presented for sale in our cafes.\n\nIn FY2024, we achieved a 74% paper use reduction from our FY2019 baseline (exceeding our 60% reduction target by FY2025). We have an ongoing commitment to use certified sustainable or recycled paper stock for 100% of our office paper needs.\n\nWe have committed to managing our electronic waste (e-waste) in our major offices globally through sustainably certified suppliers to ensure it is managed in a responsible manner. We are progressing the first phase of managing our e-waste which involves disposal of laptops, desktops, and information technology (IT) communications room equipment. Macquarie follows the principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle for its devices and appliances, and is aiming to improve the scope of reporting.",

The framework outlines how Macquarie manages our environmental, social, and economic impacts across the corporate supply chain, integrating sustainability throughout the procurement life cycle.\n\nWe continue to work towards our FY2025 commitment to increase our spend on environmentally and socially sustainable products, with an ambition to have 80% of prioritised goods being sustainable. Clear and consistent sustainability definitions for prioritised categories, such as IT equipment, stationery, pantry consumables, and office furniture, have been developed in partnership with our suppliers, and adoption of these new standards is underway. We have identified challenges in obtaining consistent data, at the product level, across our priority categories to enable reporting against this target, and are working to address this with our suppliers.\n\nMacquarie remains committed to spending 1% of our annual global spend (in our tier one and tier two supply chains) with diverse suppliers and 10% of our annual global spend with small businesses by FY2025. (40) In FY2024, Macquarie spent over $A25.3 million (or 0.6% of global spend) with diverse suppliers and over $A290.4 million (or 6.3% of global spend) with small businesses. Our supplier diversity commitment is now available on our website to support our conversations with our external stakeholders and our commitment to the diverse supplier community.\n\nSince the launch of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia in February 2023, Macquarie has engaged with First Nations suppliers, partnering with Supply Nation as the peak body that aims to grow the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business sector through the promotion of supplier diversity in Australia.\n\nIn FY2024, we continued to achieve 100% compliance with Macquarie's Supplier Governance Policy's environmental and social risk requirements.

The business is committed to supporting our customers through uncertain and difficult times, and understands every situation is different, offering a range of solutions that can be tailored to meet our customers' needs.\n\nBeyond the commitments made in Macquarie's RAP, BFS has continued an online First Nations cultural competency training program for relevant BFS customer-facing teams, which was developed by an Australian Indigenous business specialising in cultural competency training. The program is designed to enhance participants' understanding of First Nations peoples, culture and history while providing practical knowledge and skills to serve and support First Nations peoples more effectively.\n\n## Protecting clients from scams and fraud\n\nAs customer fraud and cyber scam attempts are increasing all around the world, BFS is committed to helping our employees, clients and customers become more cyber-resilient.\n\nBFS launched a Scams Awareness Campaign, which includes a customer education program focused on providing the latest updates on trending scams and how best to protect themselves. BFS continues to provide customers with informative content and resources through the Macquarie Scams Hub, as part of our ongoing scams awareness activity.\n\nThe Macquarie Authenticator mobile app, with leading digital security features, gives customers control to approve or deny transactions, log-in attempts or account changes in real-time, and is a key part of our proactive approach to keeping customers' accounts and information safe.\n\nThroughout FY2024, BFS has continued to invest in fraud prevention solutions to help identify and prevent fraud and scam losses.\n\n## Providing innovative digital solutions\n\nAs a digital bank, BFS has a strong focus on innovation, and a key part of that is the development of new products, features and reduced costs for customers. While digital security enhancements make it safer and easier to manage risks for our customers, innovation also allows us to enhance how they manage their money with intuitive and connected digital banking experiences.\n\nOur everyday transaction account allows customers to apply for an account, have their identity fully verified and start banking in under three minutes.

Recently, attention on greenwashing as a regulatory, litigation and reputational risk is increasing. Greenwashing is defined at Macquarie as a false, misleading, unsubstantiated, ambiguous or overstated representation of the ESG attributes of an organisation, product or service. This definition is intended to incorporate similar concepts such as impact-washing and social-washing. While the regimes that govern greenwashing vary between jurisdictions, and good practice continues to evolve, we recognise the importance of mitigating this risk for our stakeholders. In FY2024 we implemented a company-wide Greenwashing Standard to support the management of legal, regulatory, reputational and environmental and social risks associated with greenwashing. It provides information on communications with potential for greenwashing risk, and review considerations and requirements in managing greenwashing risk.

Female representation on the MGL Board of Directors has stayed at 62.5% with the retirement of Nicola Wakefield Evans and the appointment of Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz, who is currently also President of Chief Executive Women (CEW) in Australia.\n\nFemale representation has increased year-on-year across Macquarie's total workforce and senior executive population. There was a temporary increase in female representation at the Executive Committee level because Nicholas O'Kane stepped down as Group Head of CGM and from the Executive Committee before 31 March 2024, whereas new CGM Group Head Simon Wright was not appointed to Executive Committee until 1 April 2024. Female representation in the Division Head population decreased because of some senior male appointments.\n\nTable 1: Global female representation by level over five years (1)\n\n| As of 31 March          |   2020 % |   2021 % |   2022 % |   2023 % |   2024 % |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Board of Directors      |     36.4 |     45.5 |     50   |     62.5 |     62.5 |\n| Executive Committee (2) |     25   |     27.3 |     30   |     30   |     33.3 |\n| Division Head (3)       |     23.9 |     23   |     26.5 |     25.5 |     23.3 |\n| Senior Executive (4)    |     19.1 |     20.5 |     21.8 |     23.3 |     24.3 |\n| Macquarie Workforce (5) |     40.1 |     42   |     43   |     44.1 |     44.3 |\n\nWe supported the work of CEW and its partner Intersection, as the sponsor of a research project and report detailing the experiences of culturally diverse women leaders. To launch the report, 'Unlocking Leadership: Conversations about Gender and Race in Corporate Australia', we hosted an event where our CEO joined a panel to discuss the findings, which she also addressed as a keynote speaker at the CEW Leadership Summit in Melbourne.\n\nWe continue to invest in gender equity partnerships and programs around the world, including the Bright Network in EMEA, Girls who Invest in the US and The Women's Foundation, Girls Go Tech, and NavGurukul in Asia. The Male Allies program in Asia is now in its third year.\n\nOur CEO hosted an International Women's Day event, leading a discussion on this year's United Nations theme, Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress , exploring how the economic empowerment of women, within Macquarie and the broader community, contributes to building a resilient society and dynamic future economy. Ms Wikramanayake was joined by Nicole Sorbara, our Global COO and Group Head of COG, Lisa Sonnabend, CGM's Global COO and Head of its Central Division, Ric Deverell, Macquarie's Chief Economist and Head of Net Zero, and Lisa George, Global Head of the Macquarie Group Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Families and carers\n\nMacquarie continues to provide support to working parents and carers through flexibility, paid leave, and initiatives such as coaching. We were the first organisation in Australia to achieve a National Level 3 carer accreditation from Carers+Employers and have retained accreditation as a Family Friendly Workplace.\n\nMacquarie's global return to work rate was 97% in FY2024 and we continue to achieve high retention rates for employees who have taken parental leave. To support the transition back to work after a period of parental leave, our employees can choose to take 12 paid transition days in the first 12 weeks of returning to work. This benefit, and other forms of flexibility are available to parents and carers in all regions.\n\n## Cultural diversity and racial equity\n\nCultural diversity and racial equity continue to be priorities for Macquarie, and we take an active and localised approach to drive progress in our business and communities. We continue to invest in internship and recruitment channels that expand our reach and better connect with talent from under-represented racial groups around the world.\n\nMacquarie was shortlisted for 'Company of the Year' in the European Diversity Awards 2023 and ranked a top 10 exemplary employer in the Ethnicity Awards in the UK.

We continued to partner with Seizing Every Opportunity (SEO) and Hive Diversity, growing the talent pipeline for the future.\n\nIn Australia, in line with our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), Macquarie held sessions to support staff in informing and educating themselves on the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The sessions featured Greg Ward, Group Head of BFS, in conversation with Indigenous ABC commentator Dan Bourchier, and Group General Counsel, Evie Bruce, in conversation with University of Sydney Professor Emerita, Anne Twomey. More than 4,000 Australian employees (approximately 40% of the ANZ workforce) also completed an eLearning program made available to them on this topic.\n\n## LGBTQ+\n\nOnce again, Macquarie has been recognised by external community partners as a leading LGBTQ+ inclusive organisation. Macquarie achieved a perfect score (one hundred) for the fifth consecutive year on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in the US.

We have progressed our work on a global Accessibility Action Plan (AAP). Elements of the plan address candidate, employee and customer experiences, global offices, and technology.\n\n## Progress - Our equity commitment\n\nOur equity commitment extends beyond candidate and employee experience to customers and our supply chain. It also guides the work of the Macquarie Group Foundation (Foundation), which has taken steps to evolve its grantmaking processes and practices globally with the goal of becoming a more equitable funder. The Foundation also funds organisations that focus on promoting a more equitable and just society for underrepresented people.\n\nWe monitor diversity data to ensure equitable outcomes in candidate and employee experiences such as recruitment, performance, remuneration and promotion.\n\nMacquarie conducts annual pay equity reviews, provides comprehensive data to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) in Australia, and is also required to adhere to regulatory requirements in other locations where we operate.\n\nMacquarie has continually ensured that we have pay equity across the organisation for men and women performing the same roles, similar roles, or work of equal or comparable value. This is reviewed on an annual basis, during which we work with all groups as part of Macquarie's commitment to ensure there is no bias in how we pay our people and to maintain pay equity for like roles and performance.\n\n## Progress - Our inclusive culture\n\nMacquarie has a range of Employee Network Groups (ENGs) and DEI committees in each region. Their focus spans culture and heritage, First Nations, gender, LGBTQ+, race and ethnicity, families and carers, neurodiversity, and military veterans. They amplify the voices of under-represented people, enhance networks, and support our DEI strategy.\n\nAllies are essential to inclusion. Macquarie continues to offer Allyship and Inclusive Leadership training, especially to Management.\n\nEvery employee is held accountable for contributing to our inclusive culture through the Macquarie Standards and Objectives, which include DEI.\n\nInclusion remains a strong component of Macquarie's culture. Progress is measured through an annual employee engagement survey, which also informs local and regional action plans.",

CRBF funds clinical research into sarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer, whilst also raising awareness to promote early diagnosis, and providing support for patients and their families.\n\nIn FY2024, the team were recognised with a Macquarie Award (Community category) for their fundraising.\n\n'It was a thrill to win the Macquarie Award and receive an additional charitable donation for CRBF. This is a close and personal cause for many at Macquarie, especially for those who knew Cooper personally before his passing in 2017. To raise over $A158,000 including matching from the Foundation for such a meaningful cause was an honour and it has truly been one of the highlights of our Macquarie journey.'\n\n## Avantika Pratap\n\nBanking and Financial Services, Sydney\n\n## Our businesses\n\n## Driving shared value\n\nThe Foundation is partnering with Macquarie businesses to integrate a shared value approach into existing business models and identify upcoming projects that can deliver both increased social value and commercial advantage.\n\nGeoff Segal was part of the Macquarie Capital team who won the inaugural Macquarie Shared Value Award for their Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Major Bridge P3 Initiative.\n\n'As well as having a direct positive impact on the local economy, this project will establish an enduring workforce development program. When we commenced work on the proposal, we sought advice from the Foundation team on how we could maximise the benefit of the project for jobseekers in the local community.\n\nIt's a great example of how our work can build a better future for the communities in which we operate by delivering both economic and social outcomes.'\n\n## Geoff Segal\n\nMacquarie Capital, New York\n\n## Our communities\n\nMacquarie's support for grant and social impact investment partners expands beyond funding thanks to our people.\n\n## Supporting Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award winners\n\nThe Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award Ambassador Network was established to engage employees to further support and contribute to each of the five causes. Emily Mellett volunteers her time on The Ocean Cleanup Ambassador network, which brings together colleagues from across the globe.\n\n'As a network, we have organised a range of initiatives to raise awareness and funds for The Ocean Cleanup's mission. We've also supported them to progress a global research study, which aims to identify global and political incentives to fund the cleanup efforts. The strength of Macquarie's networks and connectivity allowed us to provide essential and different insights to support them to progress their analysis and research and develop their industry connections.'\n\n## Emily Mellett\n\nCorporate Operations Group, London\n\n## Supporting our Racial Equity Fund grant partners\n\nIn addition to funding for grant partners, the Foundation creates opportunities for staff engagement through mentoring, training, knowledge sharing and employability programs.\n\nIn November 2023, nearly 50 college sophomores in Houston and New York celebrated completion of Macquarie's first ever Racial Equity Fund externship, designed to expose students that have historically been underrepresented in the sector to financial services. Through the externship, students spent eight weeks meeting with Macquarie colleagues, building their skills and confidence and growing their knowledge of the business.\n\n'During their time at Macquarie, the externs toured our offices, visited Macquarie-owned assets and connected with over 40 Macquarie colleagues for mentorship, networking, mock interviews and informational sessions. Students also completed a final project to develop an investment pitch in the green energy sector, meeting with colleagues from across Macquarie to refine their presentations and deliver a final pitch. It was fantastic to see Macquarie's Racial Equity Fund make such an impactful experience for the students.'\n\n## Nicole Spaur\n\nRisk Management Group, Houston\n\n## Working groups dedicated to breaking down barriers to employment\n\nAcross Asia there are several working groups made up of passionate employees who come together to support a non-profit organisation.\n\nIn Manila, one working group supports the Fair Training Center (FTC), which focuses on ending the forced labour of migrant workers by reinventing domestic worker training. The working group has organised fundraising and volunteering throughout the year for FTC and recently collaborated with a local designer to help FTC revamp its video training materials.\n\n'Being part of a group of volunteers focused on creating better migration outcomes for migrant workers is a meaningful way to make a difference. I've taken volunteer leave and sought matching from the Foundation to further contribute to FTC, so I'm grateful that Macquarie supports me to give back in this way.'\n\n## Camille Andrada\n\nCorporate Operations Group, Manila\n\n## Pro bono contributions enabling social impact investments\n\nEvery social impact investment the Foundation makes utilises knowledge and expertise from across Macquarie. The Foundation collaborates with small teams of colleagues from around the world who conduct various forms of due diligence, incorporating impact, commercial and risk considerations.\n\nDuring FY2024 Courtney Lollback and James Gardner from Macquarie's Asset Management Group and Legal and Governance Group provided their expertise on Macquarie's investment into the Growth Impact Fund social impact investment, announced in October 2023.\n\n'The opportunity to work alongside the Foundation on commercial and financial due diligence of the Growth Impact Fund investment was a highlight of my year. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the chance to put my skills to use to help create positive social change.'\n\n## Courtney Lollback\n\nMacquarie Asset Management, London\n\n'Working on the Growth Impact Fund transaction was brilliant in many ways. It's been helpful from a professional perspective, great to work with different people and to be running towards something that feels purposeful and tangible.'\n\n## James Gardner\n\nLegal and Governance Group, Macquarie Asset Management, London",

In accomplishing its role with respect to risk management, among the Board's key responsibilities are oversight of management's operation of Macquarie's risk management framework, approving risk appetite and the risk management strategy, engagement with key regulators and forming a view of risk culture.\n\n## Role of Management\n\nThe Group Heads of the Operating and Central Service Groups are responsible for the implementation of the risk management framework in their Groups. They are required semi-annually to attest that key risks have been identified and are adequately controlled in their Groups. These management representations support the sign-off of the half-year and full-year financial statements.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management adopts the 'three lines of defence' model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities functionally independent from oversight and assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 primary responsibility for day-to-day risk management lies with the business. The risk owner is the first line of defence. All staff throughout Macquarie are expected to manage risks in accordance with the risk management framework\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management Group (RMG) forms the second line of defence and provides independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all internal and external sources of material risk. Macquarie maintains a single risk management framework that is applied appropriately throughout the Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\nIn determining those risks that are material to Macquarie, we assess the potential for a risk to affect our earnings resilience and financial strength across market cycles, our ability to meet regulatory obligations, our stakeholders, and our reputation.\n\nMacquarie's material risks include asset, conduct, country, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational, regulatory and compliance, strategic, tax, technology and cyber, and work health and safety risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails about the risks we manage are available at macquarie.com/riskmanagement\n\nDetails on Environmental and Social risks, and Work Health and Safety risks, are set out in the ESG section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Key components\n\n## Risk management principles\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level: Group Heads are responsible for ownership of material risks that arise in, or because of, their business' operations, including identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, control and mitigation of these risks. Before making decisions, clear analysis of the risks is sought to ensure those decisions are consistent with the risk appetite and strategy of Macquarie\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes: Macquarie's risk management approach is based on examining the consequences of worst-case outcomes and determining whether these are acceptable and within Macquarie's risk appetite. This approach is adopted for all material risk types and is often achieved by stress testing. Macquarie operates a number of sophisticated quantitative risk management processes, but the foundation of the approach is the informed consideration of both quantitative and qualitative inputs by experienced professionals\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG: Macquarie places significant importance on having a strong, independent risk management function to review, challenge and sign-off all material risk acceptance decisions. It is essential that RMG has the capability to do this effectively. RMG has invested in recruiting skilled professionals from a range of industries, including those with trading or advisory and capital markets experience. For all material proposals, RMG's opinion must be sought at an early stage in the decision-making process. The approval document submitted to Senior Management must include independent input from RMG on risk and return.",

RMG designs and oversees the implementation of the risk management framework. RMG is structured into specialist functional divisions (depicted below) and employs an integrated approach to risk analysis and management across risk classes. RMG's assessment and monitoring of risks involves a collaborative effort across the divisions to ensure a detailed analysis takes place both at the individual and aggregate risk level.\n\nRMG's oversight of risk is based on five principles:\n\n- \u00b7 independence: RMG is independent of Macquarie's Operating Groups and other Central Service Groups. The Head of RMG, as the CRO, reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the BRiC. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions\n- \u00b7 centralised risk management: RMG's responsibility covers the whole of Macquarie. It assesses risks from a company-wide perspective and provides a consistent approach across Macquarie\n- \u00b7 approval of all new business activities: the Operating and Central Service Groups may not undertake new businesses or activities, offer new products, enter new markets, or undertake significant projects without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committees and the Board\n- \u00b7 continuous assessment: RMG continually reviews risks to account for changes in market circumstances and developments within Macquarie's business\n- \u00b7 frequent monitoring and reporting: the risk profile of Macquarie with respect to all material risks is monitored by RMG on an ongoing basis. Centralised systems exist to allow RMG to monitor financial risks daily. For the valuation of all trading positions and deals, daily revaluation factors are sourced, where possible, from independent market sources. Reporting on all material risks is provided to Senior Management, the Board and relevant Board Committees.\n\n## RMG structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Internal Audit Division (IAD), as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance to the Board Audit Committee (BAC), Board, other relevant Board Committees and Senior Management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework, including its governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for managing material risks. The Internal Audit Division assesses whether material risks have been properly identified by management and reported to the Board or relevant Board Committees, and whether key internal controls have been properly designed and are operating effectively and sustainably to mitigate those material risks.\n\nThe BAC has primary power of direction over the IAD and is accountable for reviewing the effectiveness of the IAD. The Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the BAC and is primarily accountable to it. The Head of Internal Audit has unrestricted access to the BAC (and its Chair) and meets privately with the BAC members at least annually. The BAC monitors and reviews the performance, objectives, rating, remuneration and degree of independence of the Head of Internal Audit. The BAC also approves any appointment and removal of the Head of Internal Audit. The Head of Internal Audit reports operationally to the CRO for day-to-day management. For audit matters relating to RMG, the role of the CRO is substituted by the CEO.",

Macquarie's Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) defines the overarching risk-taking settings of Macquarie through risk appetite and risk tolerances.\n\nAs part of the Annual Strategy Review and Business Planning process, RMG undertakes an independent review of Macquarie's strategy and considers how risks identified could individually or in aggregate impact Macquarie's risk profile and risk appetite. Macquarie's strategy and the outcome of RMG's review together inform the annual review of Macquarie's risk appetite and tolerance settings.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is a key component of Macquarie's risk management framework and is integrated with Macquarie's strategy review and financial forecasting. Stress testing, including scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis, is a key tool that informs the calibration of Macquarie's risk tolerances; provides insights into the Annual Strategy Review and Business Planning process; and tests and informs whether Macquarie's strategy remains, and is forecast to remain, in line with its risk appetite.\n\n## Policies\n\nPolicies are key tools for ensuring that risks taken are consistent with Macquarie's risk appetite. They are designed to set out the principles that govern decision-making across Macquarie.\n\n## New product and business approval process\n\nAll new businesses, new products, major organisational projects, and significant changes to existing businesses, products, processes or systems which will expose Macquarie to new or significantly varied risks must be assessed against the applicable risk appetite and tolerances.\n\nThis formal process sets out the requirement for each Operating and Central Service Group to have a demonstrable robust change management process to ensure material risks are appropriately identified, assessed and within Macquarie's risk appetite as defined in the RAS. The Operating and Central Service Groups may not undertake the proposed activity without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews and assesses risk and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the Board.\n\nRMG is also responsible for reviewing that all relevant internal approvals are obtained prior to commencement.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie's risk management framework since inception. Macquarie sets, promotes, monitors and reflects on the effectiveness of our risk culture. All staff have a role in managing risk. Ownership of risk, including risk culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC, is responsible for forming a view on Macquarie's risk culture and the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently within its risk appetite. The Board also identifies and monitors any necessary or desirable actions to change the risk culture.\n\nMacquarie's approach to maintaining a sound risk culture is based on three components:\n\n## Setting behavioural expectations\n\nSenior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie's purpose is defined by our principles of What We Stand For: Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are specified in the Board-approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through the organisation.\n\n## Leading and executing\n\nManagement implements behavioural expectations through:\n\n- \u00b7 leadership actions and communication\n- \u00b7 organisational governance\n- \u00b7 incentives and consequence management\n- \u00b7 organisational and individual capability.\n\n## Monitoring, measuring and reporting\n\nMacquarie monitors and measures its risk culture to gauge its effectiveness while promoting continuous improvement. Mechanisms include:\n\n- \u00b7 reports incorporating behavioural indicators (such as policy, limit and training breaches) prepared by all Operating and Central Service Groups, including reports prepared by RMG, HR and Macquarie's Integrity Office, and escalated where relevant, in accordance with our governance framework. These include regular reports relating to risk culture which are provided to Senior Management, the Board and relevant Board Committees\n- \u00b7 risk culture teams in both RMG Prudential Risk and IAD undertake a range of business level and thematic assessments of risk culture and behaviour.\n\nThese mechanisms facilitate a feedback loop of sharing good practice and lessons learnt to enable cultural alignment.",

Risk considerations are embedded throughout the remuneration process, including through the determination of individual profit share allocations, business group and company-wide profit share pools, as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered. Effective consequence management is a key component of Macquarie's risk culture. Macquarie aims to apply consequences for non-compliance in a timely manner, and as fairly and consistently as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Remuneration Report for more details on Macquarie's remuneration framework and consequence management process\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nMacquarie defines conduct risk as the risk of behaviour, action or omission by individuals employed by, or on behalf of, Macquarie or taken collectively in representing Macquarie that may have a negative outcome for our clients, counterparties, the communities and markets in which we operate, our staff, or Macquarie.\n\nSuch behaviour, actions or omissions may include:\n\n- \u00b7 breaches of laws or regulations\n- \u00b7 disregard for Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For or the Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 negligence and/or a lack of reasonable care and diligence\n- \u00b7 failure to escalate improper conduct\n- \u00b7 inadequate product design and distribution.\n\nConduct risk can arise inadvertently or deliberately in any of Macquarie's Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\nMacquarie's approach to conduct risk management is integrated in our risk management framework and is consistent with our three lines of defence model. Risk-taking must be consistent with Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For and the Board-approved Code of Conduct .\n\nMacquarie has a range of controls and processes in place to identify and manage conduct risk, including:\n\n- \u00b7 new and emerging conduct risks are identified through the annual strategy and business planning process\n- \u00b7 conduct risks that may arise when Macquarie establishes a new business or product, or makes a significant change to an existing business, product, process or system are identified and assessed through the new business and product approval process\n- \u00b7 independent monitoring and surveillance conducted by RMG, in addition to front line supervisory activities performed by the business\n- \u00b7 the Risk and Control Self-Assessment requires businesses to identify and assess their key conduct risks\n- \u00b7 supporting the efficient operation of markets through appropriate controls and monitoring\n- \u00b7 where incidents occur, businesses investigate the underlying contributing behaviours and  are responsible for recording all conduct related issues and incidents in Macquarie's Governance, Risk and Compliance system, and escalating within the set timeframes\n- \u00b7 performance-based remuneration reflects an individual's performance, which is assessed against a range of financial and non-financial factors including approach to risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 an Integrity Office that is an independent point of contact for staff to safely raise concerns about misconduct, unethical behaviour or breaches of the Code of Conduct , and protects those who raise concerns under Macquarie's Whistleblower Policy\n- \u00b7 a global Staff Hotline for staff who wish to speak up anonymously\n- \u00b7 a Customer Advocate Office (ANZ only) to promote fair and reasonable customer complaint outcomes and to review and assist with determining escalated customer complaints.",

AASB 9 contains requirements for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments, hedge accounting requirements and, from a credit provisioning perspective, introduced an expected credit loss methodology, which differed to the incurred loss methodology applied prior to FY2019.\n\nFor AASB 9 disclosures refer to Note 36.1 Credit risk to the financial statements including disclosure of loan asset exposures by stage of credit performance.

Wikramanayake, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n\nOther than Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz, the Directors listed above each held office as a Director of MGL throughout the financial year ended 31 March 2024.\n\nMs Lloyd-Hurwitz was appointed as an Independent Director on 1 June 2023. Ms N.M. Wakefield Evans AM retired as an Independent Director on 29 February 2024.\n\nThose Directors listed as Independent Directors have been independent throughout the period of their appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of the qualifications, experience and special responsibilities of the Directors and qualifications and experience of the Company Secretaries at the date of this report are set out on pages 96 to 100.\n\n## Directors' and officers' indemnification and insurance\n\nUnder MGL's Constitution, MGL indemnifies all past and present directors and secretaries of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including at this time the Directors named in this report and the Secretaries), against certain liabilities and costs incurred by them in their respective capacities. The indemnity covers the following liabilities and legal costs (subject to the exclusions described as follows):\n\n- \u00b7 every liability incurred by the person in their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 all legal costs incurred in defending or resisting (or otherwise in connection with) proceedings in which the person becomes involved because of their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 legal costs incurred by the person in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance and discharge of their duties as an officer of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, if that has been approved in accordance with MGL policy.\n\nThis indemnity does not apply to the extent that:\n\n- \u00b7 MGL is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against the liability or legal costs, or\n- \u00b7 an indemnity by MGL of the person against the liability or legal costs, if given, would be made void by law.\n\nMGL has also entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity, Insurance and Disclosure (as amended from time to time) (Deed) with each of the Directors. Under the Deed, MGL agrees to, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 indemnify the Director upon terms broadly consistent with the indemnity contained in MGL's Constitution\n- \u00b7 take out and maintain an insurance policy against liabilities incurred by the Director acting as an officer of MGL or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The insurance policy must be for an amount and on terms and conditions appropriate for a reasonably prudent company in MGL's position. Insurance must be maintained for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings)\n- \u00b7 grant access to the Director to all relevant company papers (including Board papers and other documents) for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings).\n\nIn addition, MGL made an Indemnity and Insurance Deed Poll on 12 September 2007 (Deed Poll). The benefit of the undertakings made by MGL under the Deed Poll have been given to each of the directors, secretaries, persons involved in the management and certain other persons, of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other companies where the person is acting as such at the specific request of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Deed Poll provides for broadly the same indemnity and insurance arrangements for those persons with the benefit of the Deed Poll as for the Deed described above. However, the Deed Poll does not provide for access to company documents.\n\nThe indemnities and insurance arrangements provided for under the MGL Constitution, the Deed and the Deed Poll, are broadly consistent with the corresponding indemnities and insurance arrangements provided under the MBL Constitution and deeds entered into by MBL.\n\nMacquarie maintains a Directors' and Officers' insurance policy that provides cover for each person in favour of whom such insurance is required to be taken out under the Deed and the Deed Poll and for MGL in indemnifying such persons pursuant to the Deed and the Deed Poll. Relevant individuals pay the premium attributable to the direct coverage under the policy and MGL pays the premium attributable to the company reimbursement coverage under the policy. The Directors' and Officers' insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the premium payable under the policy and the nature of the liabilities insured.\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, MGL has agreed to reimburse its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), for any liability (including reasonable legal costs) PwC incurs in connection with any claim by a third party arising from MGL's breach of the letter of engagement dated 5 July 2023.",

The fundamentals of our businesses remain sound, as demonstrated by the strength and diversity of the underlying franchises, strong and conservative balance sheet, proven risk management framework and our distinct culture.\n\nMacquarie remains well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders, consistent with our track record. In less supportive markets, financial results in FY2024 are down from a record FY2023. Consistent with our established remuneration framework that rewards performance across a range of financial and non-financial measures and aligns outcomes for staff with those of our shareholders, total profit share awarded to staff is substantially down on the prior year.\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes for FY2024\n\nThe Board remains focused on ensuring there is a robust and rigorous process in place to determine remuneration outcomes. Significant oversight and judgement are applied so that our remuneration outcomes are aligned with both individual and company-wide financial and non-financial performance and Macquarie's ongoing success.\n\nIn considering Macquarie's non-financial performance, the Board recognises the importance of sound ESG practices as part of their responsibility to clients, shareholders, employees and the communities in which Macquarie operates.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nFollowing record financial results in FY2023, Macquarie delivered:\n\n- \u00b7 net profit after tax (NPAT) of $A3,522 million in FY2024 (down 32% from FY2023)\n- \u00b7 return on equity (ROE) of 10.8% (down compared to FY2023's 16.9%)\n- \u00b7 earnings per share (EPS) of 916.6 cents per share (down 32% compared to FY2023)\n- \u00b7 the FY2024 full-year dividend is down 15% compared to FY2023",

These factors, as well as lower overall revenue, led to the significant increase in the compensation expense to income ratio to 43.1%.\n\n## Non-financial performance\n\nIn addition to financial performance, the Board's determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2024 for the CEO and other Executive KMP reflects the following non-financial factors which the Board sees as essential drivers of long-term sustainable growth:\n\n- \u00b7 the strong leadership of the Executive Committee, led by the CEO, to effectively role model our purpose and principles and to embed a strong risk culture\n- \u00b7 Executive Committee collaboration to solve challenges and maximise opportunities across Operating and Central Service Groups\n- \u00b7 the continued evolution of our businesses to remain well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value, including alignment with areas of structural growth globally (e.g. energy transition, infrastructure for digital and demographic shifts)\n- \u00b7 the continued focus on non-financial risks, including in areas such as climate, sustainability and technology, while also uplifting our risk management frameworks across trading, technology, cyber and data. While there were no systemic risk issues identified during the year, a legacy risk matter in MAM was taken into account in determining the MGL CEO's remuneration\n- \u00b7 a focus on streamlining investment programs and driving greater returns on investment, following a period of significant investment in our platform\n- \u00b7 investment in renewable energy solutions at scale, supporting the next wave of climate technologies\n- \u00b7 maintaining strong engagement and focus on meeting regulator expectations including progress against the remediation program with APRA to ensure there is appropriate focus on Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL)\n- \u00b7 the refresh of our global employee value proposition to evolve in line with shifts in talent expectations and ensure we accurately reflect the career experience and distinct culture that Macquarie offers.\n\nIn addition to assessing the performance of the CEO and other Executive KMP, the BRC is also very aware of competitive market pressures when determining remuneration outcomes. The attraction and retention of high-performing, diverse talent, with deep industry expertise, is a key element of Macquarie's strategy. Macquarie's remuneration framework plays an important role in achieving this. As part of determining remuneration outcomes, the BRC considers relativities in the global markets in which each business competes for talent, including in industries that are not publicly listed with undisclosed remuneration outcomes.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Board and the BRC have given careful consideration to both financial and non-financial factors, and we believe the following outcomes for the year are appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 MGL CEO awarded profit share has decreased 26% on the prior year to $A23.75 million, which reflects the decrease in financial results while considering her strong leadership and ongoing commitment to fostering a positive culture\n- \u00b7 MBL CEO awarded profit share of $A3.75 million, reflecting efforts to uplift the role of the MBL CEO\n- \u00b7 total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share of $A80.20 million (down 15% on the prior year) (1)\n\n- \u00b7 Performance Share Unit (PSU) allocations of $A4.0 million for the MGL CEO and $A2.8 million for each Executive KMP, in line with the prior year.\n\n## Changes to the remuneration framework\n\nChanges to our remuneration framework, including those previously announced in the 2022 and 2023 Remuneration Reports, have been implemented for FY2024 to meet the requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511). These changes are referenced throughout the relevant sections of this report and include:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration increases, effective 1 April 2023, the first since 2010, other than adjustments made at the time of a new appointment to the Executive Committee\n- \u00b7 a reduction in retention rates and vesting periods (to reflect that awards from FY2024 will no longer be accelerated over two years in the case of retirement or redundancy and will instead vest on their original vesting schedule).\n\nThese changes are reflected in the awarded pay outcomes for Executive KMP set out on pages 130-139.\n\nWe engaged with APRA during the year in regard to our implementation of CPS 511 and remain committed to ensuring our remuneration framework complies with and considers the spirit and intent of CPS 511 and remains fit for purpose.\n\n## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nOur approach to remuneration plays an important role in promoting Macquarie's culture. Our framework supports our purpose by motivating staff to be innovative and build businesses but also be accountable for their decisions, behaviours and associated risk management, customer, economic and reputational consequences.\n\nOur purpose and core principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity remain pivotal to our culture and effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward when making decisions that realise opportunities for the benefit of our clients, our shareholders, our people and the communities in which we operate. The Board recognises the importance of continually assessing Macquarie's culture formally through surveys and Board reporting and informally through direct interactions with staff.\n\nRisk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand that they are rewarded for their performance, including the identification and management of risk, and that there are consequences for non-compliance with Macquarie's behavioural expectations.\n\nIn FY2024, there were 131 (FY2023: 129) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. Consistent with prior years, further details regarding these matters are disclosed on page 122.\n\nThe BRC assessed and determined that there were no instances that required the application of malus or clawback during the year.\n\nI look forward to receiving your views and support at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJillian Broadbent AC Chair Board Remuneration Committee Sydney 3 May 2024",

It supports our What We Stand For principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity, which express how we do business. Our longstanding and consistent approach to remuneration continues to support this purpose and aligns with our What We Stand For principles.\n\nOur remuneration framework has been a key driver of our sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term, taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk management, customer, economic and reputational outcomes. Their interests are aligned with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers, while ensuring that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld.\n\nThis framework has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue to attract, motivate and retain exceptional and entrepreneurial people with deep industry expertise across the 34 markets in which we operate. These people come from organisations that broadly operate in the same markets and compete for the same people as Macquarie in various industry sectors (including hedge funds, private equity firms, global investment banks, fund managers, advisory boutiques, commodity houses and other banks, as well as industries that are not specific to banking or financial services, for example, technology, accounting, and engineering) across many jurisdictions.\n\nThis broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with our remuneration principles and the expectations of our stakeholders.\n\nThe table below shows the link between our purpose, What We Stand For principles and our remuneration objectives and principles.\n\n## Our purpose:\n\n## Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpportunity\n\nRemuneration objectives\n\nRemuneration principles\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise\n- \u00b7 deliver strong company performance over the short and long-term whilst prudently managing risk\n- \u00b7 promote effective management of financial and non-financial risks, and Macquarie's long-term soundness\n- \u00b7 align the interests of staff and shareholders to deliver sustained results for our customers, clients and community\n- \u00b7 promote innovation and the building of sustainable businesses\n- \u00b7 drive behaviours that reflect Macquarie's culture and the principles of What We Stand For and support the prevention and mitigation of conduct risk\n- \u00b7 foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment.\n\nThese objectives are achieved by:\n\n- \u00b7 emphasising performance-based remuneration\n- \u00b7 determining an individual's variable remuneration based on a range of financial and non-financial factors\n- \u00b7 having the ability to adjust performance-based remuneration to reflect risk outcomes, where appropriate\n- \u00b7 retaining a significant proportion of performance-based remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period\n- \u00b7 delivering retained profit share in equity to ensure the interests of staff and shareholders are aligned over the long-term\n- \u00b7 remunerating high-performing staff appropriately, relative to global peers\n- \u00b7 providing consistent arrangements over time to give staff the confidence to pursue multi-year initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrity",

role and responsibilities. Individual profit share allocations also consider relativities in the markets in which each business competes for talent.\n\nWhen determining individual profit share allocations, consideration is given to any matters raised in the independent reports provided to the BRC by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Head of Internal Audit, or matters raised through the consequence management process, which may result in downward adjustments to profit share allocations for relevant individuals (see page 122). Significant judgement is applied in determining remuneration outcomes to ensure all factors that may potentially impact the quantum of profit share allocations are considered.",

While they are employed, an individual's retained profit share vests and is released over a period that reflects the scope and nature of their role and responsibilities. (3) These arrangements ensure that Macquarie continues to retain high-performing staff, provide significant long-term alignment to shareholders and customers, as well as enable risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period.\n\nRetention and vesting arrangements are determined by the BRC according to prevailing market conditions, remuneration trends, and regulatory requirements (including CPS 511, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) and the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR)). For each year's allocation, once the vesting period has been determined it remains fixed for that allocation.\n\nAs previously announced, there have been changes to the retention rates and vesting periods for certain senior employees (including the CEO, Executive KMP and other roles specified under CPS 511) for profit share allocations made in respect of FY2024 onwards.\n\nThe table below summarises the standard retention and vesting arrangements applicable for FY2024. These vesting periods do not include the performance year but begin following the date remuneration is awarded.\n\n## Standard profit share retention and vesting arrangements for FY2024\n\n| Role                                         | Profit share retention (%)   | Vesting and release of profit share   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| CEO                                          | 70                           | One-third in each of years 3-5        |\n| MBL CEO                                      | 60                           | One-third in each of years 3-5        |\n| Executive Committee members                  | 50                           | One-third in each of years 3-5        |\n| Other Executive Directors (4),(5)            | 40                           | One-third in each of years 3-5        |\n| Staff other than Executive Directors (5),(6) | 25-40                        | One-third in each of years 2-4        |\n\nThe Board's discretion to change remuneration arrangements, as noted above, includes changes to profit share retention levels provided that at least 30% of profit share is retained for all Executive Directors.\n\n- (5) For certain staff subject to UK or European remuneration regulations, up to 60% may be retained.

For example, this may include investment in funds or products of a specific business group where there is a need to directly align the interests of staff with those of their clients.\n\n## Forfeiture - malus and clawback\n\nThe Board has the ability to reduce or eliminate unvested retained profit share in certain circumstances (malus). In FY2024, the population subject to malus was expanded to include all staff (previously malus applied to senior employees). For certain employees identified under CPS 511 or UK and European remuneration regulations, the Board also has the ability to recover (in whole or in part) vested profit share in certain circumstances (clawback). For more details on Macquarie's malus and clawback framework, see page 121.\n\n## Vesting and release of retained profit share upon departure from Macquarie\n\nThe standard policy is that staff who cease employment with Macquarie will forfeit their unvested retained profit share. The Board may exercise discretion for the vesting and release of a departing employee's retained profit share after their employment has ended including, for example, in the case of retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, or serious ill health. Where such discretion is exercised, the release of any profit share may be subject to malus and/or clawback, as applicable, and the Board may impose such other conditions as it considers appropriate. For Executive Directors, the Board's discretion for the vesting and release of retained profit share under these circumstances is subject to the conditions of release as set out below.\n\nDiscretion may be exercised in certain other limited exceptional circumstances on the grounds of business efficacy, in relation to strategic business objectives, including in connection with the divestment or internalisation of Macquarie businesses, or when an employee resigns to fulfil a public service role in a governmental organisation or agency. This year, such discretion has been exercised and retained profit share was approved to be released for eight executives due to their transition during FY2024 to employment, engagement or appointment, with or for an asset or a portfolio company of a Macquarie-managed fund or an operationally segregated subsidiary.",

As such they provide an additional incentive to Executive Committee members to drive company-wide performance over the long-term and beyond their Operating and Central Service Group responsibilities. PSU awards are a meaningful incentive but are generally not the major element of an Executive Committee member's total remuneration.\n\nAs previously announced, for awards in respect of FY2024 onwards, the vesting period for PSUs granted to the CEO and the MBL CEO has been extended by a year, to five years. In addition, prior to the vesting of PSUs, the Board will conduct a pre-vest assessment of the Executive Committee's collective performance over the vesting period. The table below summarises the approach to PSU allocations in respect of FY2024.\n\n## 1. Pre-grant period (Financial Year (FY))\n\n- \u00b7 Individual PSU allocations are based on performance over the financial year prior to grant (taking into consideration both financial and non-financial factors). Considerations include their role as members of the Executive Committee and their contribution to driving the collective performance of Macquarie, including their collaboration across businesses, progress on company-wide programs and maintaining Macquarie's risk culture.\n- \u00b7 The face value of PSUs awarded to each Executive Committee member is approved by the Board as part of the annual remuneration review process. Shareholder approval is also sought at MGL's Annual General Meeting (AGM) to allocate PSU awards to the MGL CEO, who is an Executive Voting Director.\n- \u00b7 PSUs are granted in August each year, after MGL's AGM, in respect of the previous financial year. The number of PSUs allocated is calculated by dividing the face value of the award by the price of MGL ordinary shares on or around the date of grant.\n- \u00b7 PSUs are structured as DSUs with no exercise price. Holders have no right to dividend equivalent payments.\n\n## 2. Performance period (FY+1 to FY+4)\n\n- \u00b7 PSUs will only become exercisable to the extent that two equally weighted ROE and EPS performance hurdles are achieved over a four-year performance period. Details of, and the rationale for, the ROE and EPS hurdles are set out below.\n- \u00b7 The ROE and EPS performance hurdles attached to PSUs are tested at the end of the performance period and the results are reported to the BRC.\n\n## 3. Additional vesting period (FY+5)\n\n- \u00b7 For the CEO and the MBL CEO, an additional one-year period applies before PSUs may vest following the end of the four-year performance period.\n- \u00b7 For other Executive KMP, PSUs may vest on 1 July following the end of the four-year performance period.\n\n## 4. Pre-vest assessment (At end of vesting period)\n\n- \u00b7 Prior to vesting of PSU awards, the Board will conduct a holistic assessment of the Executive Committee's collective contribution to driving the performance of Macquarie over the vesting period, based on the extent to which the Executive Committee has:\n- -promoted behaviour that is consistent with and reflects Macquarie's risk culture, Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For\n- -overseen the effectiveness of Macquarie's risk management framework, regulatory compliance, policies and practices in managing key financial and non-financial risks, and\n- -overseen funding, liquidity and capital management to ensure Macquarie's financial soundness.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board forms a negative overall assessment of the relevant Executive Committee's collective performance, it will consider whether an adjustment is appropriate, taking into account any mitigating and aggravating factors.\n- \u00b7 To assist the Board with their determination of an adjustment to the PSU vesting outcome, and to ensure that the determination encompasses all relevant considerations, the BRC will receive regular reporting over the vesting period.",

The BRC's review includes consideration of the most relevant performance metrics to be used as hurdles as well as the levels at which the hurdles are achieved. The international reference group used for the ROE hurdle is also reviewed to determine whether our comparators remain suitable for Macquarie's diversified business interests and global footprint. The BRC also considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance groups, shareholders and regulators, as well as market practice.\n\nIn the FY2024 annual review, both the absolute EPS and relative ROE hurdles were considered to still be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 EPS and ROE growth drive long-term shareholder value and are appropriate as the Executive Committee can affect outcomes on both measures. In contrast, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is influenced by many external factors over which executives have limited control\n- \u00b7 EPS and ROE can be substantiated using information that is disclosed in Macquarie's annual reports\n- \u00b7 a sliding scale diversifies the risk of not achieving the hurdles and provides rewards proportionate to performance for shareholders and is preferable to an all-or-nothing test, which some have argued could promote excessive risk-taking\n- \u00b7 the hurdles are designed to reward sustained strong performance and are relatively well-insulated from short-term fluctuations\n- \u00b7 the EPS targets are confirmed as rigorous when market performance is considered, with the EPS threshold hurdle exceeding the performance of most of the ASX20, the international reference group and relevant indices over time\n- \u00b7 for the EPS element to fully vest, Macquarie needs to achieve at least 12% CAGR over the vesting period. Supporting the rigour of the hurdle, cumulative EPS growth of 57% over four years is required to achieve full vesting\n- \u00b7 the ROE vesting thresholds and sliding scale are in line with the domestic market and are particularly challenging when compared to international practice.",

        "page_content": "The charts below display Macquarie's historical EPS and ROE PSU outcomes, highlighting that since their introduction in 2009, 48% of the EPS tranches and 56% of the ROE tranches have resulted in full vesting.\n\n## Historical EPS tranche outcomes\n\n## Historical ROE tranche outcomes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8%\n\n## Use of an international reference group\n\nThe BRC has given careful consideration to the appropriate reference group to use for the relative ROE measure, recognising that Macquarie's combination of business activities, size and global footprint means that there are few direct comparators. The BRC's view is that simplistic comparator groups based on a company's country of listing, broad industry categorisation and/or market capitalisation do not accurately reflect the businesses and competitive markets for talent in which we operate.\n\nWhen assessing and determining the appropriate reference group, the BRC considers the overall size of the reference group, the degree of internationalisation (including the degree to which they compete for shareholder capital, clients and talent in each market), each comparator's overlap with Macquarie's revenue mix and the resulting business mix when considered in aggregate. Taking into account these factors, the BRC has selected an international reference group that recognises the extent of Macquarie's diversification and internationalisation.\n\nThe BRC is mindful that some of Macquarie's businesses compete with other types of financial institutions, including asset managers, retail banks, hedge funds and commodity trading houses. However, given differences in business mix, regulatory environment, or the unavailability of public financial information, it does not consider these institutions appropriate for inclusion in the PSU reference group.\n\nThe BRC considers the international reference group to be appropriate on the basis that:\n\n- \u00b7 total international income represented approximately 66% of Macquarie's total income as at 31 March 2024, with approximately 51% of Macquarie's staff located outside Australia (15)\n- \u00b7 the international reference group is currently most representative of Macquarie's business operations and talent pool. These firms broadly operate in the same markets and in similar business segments and compete for the same people as Macquarie\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n28%\n\n- \u00b7 the international reference group members share broadly comparable risk, compliance and regulatory profiles\n- \u00b7 Macquarie has no directly comparable Australian-listed peers.\n\nWhile the BRC considers it important not to intervene reactively to remove under-performers or over-performers in order to provide relative stability and transparency across market cycles, it reviews and adapts the reference group as companies, markets and other situations evolve.\n\n## Risk adjustment, malus and clawback\n\nThe Board may determine that a downward adjustment to PSU allocations prior to grant may be appropriate, including a collective adjustment where there has been an adverse outcome for MGL, MBL or their stakeholders. Risk considerations also form part of the pre-vest assessment, as set out above.\n\nIn addition, Macquarie's malus and (from FY2024) clawback provisions apply to all PSUs granted, as set out on page 121.\n\n## Departure from Macquarie or change in control\n\nThe standard policy is that unvested PSUs will be forfeited upon termination of employment. In the case of retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, serious ill-health or other limited exceptional circumstances, the Board or the BRC has the ability to accelerate the vesting of PSUs (to the extent permitted by law or regulation, for example in the case of death or serious incapacitation) or to take other action, for example to permit the PSUs to continue to vest in accordance with the original award schedule and remain subject to the same performance hurdles.\n\nShould a change of control occur, the Board or the BRC has discretion to determine how unvested PSUs should be treated, having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the performance and vesting periods, the level of performance to date, the circumstances of the change in control and any relevant legal or regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nContinued\n\n## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nThis section describes how risk and conduct are considered throughout Macquarie's remuneration approach.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nOur purpose of 'Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future' and What We Stand For principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity remain pivotal to our culture. Our purpose and principles effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward and making decisions that realise opportunity for the benefit of our clients, shareholders, partners, and the communities in which we operate. Staff are continually made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are outlined in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by management and cascaded through the organisation through multiple mechanisms. We invest significant time and effort in communicating and reinforcing our culture through communications from senior management, policy reminders, training, and learning and development activities. The Board is able to assess Macquarie's culture in a number of ways including through staff survey results, human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture reports, consequence management reports as well as through personal observation of management, and staff behaviour and actions.\n\nPrudent risk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand they are rewarded not just for their contribution to financial results, but also for how those results are achieved. This includes an assessment of an individual's approach to managing risk, and adherence with the What We Stand For principles. Staff are aware of the consequences for non-compliance with the risk management framework and Macquarie's Code of Conduct . Staff training and communications emphasise the link between risk, conduct, policy breaches and consequence management outcomes, including, where appropriate, adjustments to performance-based remuneration.\n\n## Alignment of remuneration with risk outcomes\n\nThe Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to Macquarie's remuneration approach. Risk considerations are embedded throughout the remuneration process including through the determination of individual profit share allocations, business group and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered.\n\nThe Board is aware of the increasing focus of regulators and shareholders on ensuring risk-related matters that come to light subsequent to remuneration being awarded are appropriately factored into remuneration decisions. Macquarie's retention and vesting arrangements provide a mechanism for the Board to consider risk outcomes over a longer period. Furthermore, where an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter that may result in forfeiture, malus or clawback (where applicable - see page 122), Macquarie may further defer the payment, vesting and/or release of profit share to allow for the investigation to be completed.",

There are a number of processes in place to ensure consistency (across business groups and staff levels) in the application of consequences and the determination of remuneration outcomes, including the review and challenge by senior management of consequence management outcomes at year end.\n\nWhere an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter, vesting, payment and/or release of profit share (including available and/or retained amounts) to an employee may be deferred to allow for the investigation to be completed.\n\n## Consequence management outcomes\n\nMacquarie's Consequence Management Guideline applies wherever a breach of internal policy or regulatory requirement is identified, including where there has been a breach of FAR (or prior to 15 March 2024, BEAR) accountability obligations. Consequences may include further training, removal of delegated authorities or permissions, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion, formal warnings or termination.\n\nWhere an employee has received a formal warning, their performance-based remuneration will likely be impacted and in some cases, reduced to zero. Promotion decisions may also be impacted. Impacts may also be applied where a formal warning has not been issued. In each case, judgement is exercised as to the appropriate consequence(s) based on all the relevant circumstances.\n\nIn FY2024, there were 131 (FY2023: 129) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. These included 84 (FY2023: 71) Code of Conduct or appropriate workplace behaviour related matters and 47 (FY2023: 58) other policy matters including risk management and technology breaches. Of the 131:\n\n- \u00b7 for 48 matters, termination of employment was the outcome (FY2023: 49)\n- \u00b7 for 83 matters, a formal warning was issued (FY2023: 80). Additional consequences were applied as appropriate including additional training, adjustments to profit share and/or proposed fixed remuneration increases, and/or impact to promotion (22 individuals who received a formal warning subsequently left Macquarie before year-end outcomes were applied and 60 individuals had their profit share reduced by an average of 39%).\n\nThe 131 matters were considered isolated incidents and there was no evidence of broader systemic conduct issues.",

Currently these awards range from  the equivalent of $A25,000 to $A175,000 depending on the Director level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Performance fees  (carried interest) | \u00b7  Under Macquarie Asset Management's carried interest arrangements, certain individuals with funds  responsibilities may receive a portion of their deferred performance-based remuneration as a share of  performance fees paid by Macquarie-managed funds \u00b7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Performance fees  (carried interest) | The company-wide profit share pool is adjusted downwards to reflect these deferred remuneration  arrangements, which are also taken into account in determining the individual's profit share allocation \u00b7  Consistent with market practice, these individuals are allocated an entitlement to a share of performance fees                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Performance fees  (carried interest) | \u00b7  An individual will not receive their entitlement until Macquarie has received performance fees towards the end  of the fund's life, which is typically upwards of 10 years. For arrangements implemented prior to September  2022, the entitlement will be forfeited if their employment ceases before five years from the date of allocation  For arrangements implemented from September 2022, vesting generally starts from 3 years from fund final  close. Entitlements are subject to similar forfeiture conditions as profit share              |\n| Performance fees  (carried interest) | \u00b7  Prior to joining the Executive Committee, Mr Way (who joined the Executive Committee on 1 April 2021)  participated in these arrangements for certain funds in his former role. Upon joining the Executive Committee,  he maintained his participation in these existing funds, but he has not been allocated any additional  entitlements. No other Executive Committee members currently participate in these arrangements.                                                                                                                         |\n| Hedging                              | \u00b7  Macquarie prohibits staff from hedging shares held to meet the minimum shareholding requirement and  unvested equity held in the MEREP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Employment contracts\n\nThe following table summarises key features of the employment contracts for Executive Committee members including the CEO.\n\n| Length of contract            | Permanent open-ended.                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration  review period   | 1 April to 31 March annually.                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Profit share  participation   | Executive Committee members are eligible to be considered for a profit share allocation that ensures a large part  of their remuneration is 'at risk'.

Consistent with our established remuneration framework that rewards performance across a range of financial and non-financial measures and aligns outcomes for staff with those of our shareholders, CEO awarded profit share decreased by 26% and total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share is down 15% on the prior year. The overall decline has not resulted in a corresponding decrease in statutory remuneration, which is calculated on a different basis to awarded pay and includes the vesting of historical share-based awards from prior years.\n\nThe total compensation expense is in line with the prior year, impacted by the higher average number of staff during the year, wage inflation and unfavourable foreign exchange movements. These factors, as well as lower overall revenue, led to the significant increase in the compensation expense to income ratio (compensation ratio) to 43.1%.\n\n## Comparison of performance measures and executive remuneration measures: FY2023-2024\n\n|                                                          | Expressed as    | FY2024   | FY2023   | Increase/(Decrease) %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Performance measures                                     |                 |          |          |                         |\n| NPAT                                                     | $Am             | 3,522    | 5,182    | (32%)                   |\n| Basic EPS                                                | Cents per share | 916.6    | 1,353.7  | (32%)                   |\n| Ordinary dividends                                       | Cents per share | 640.0    | 750.0    | (15%)                   |\n| Return on equity                                         | Percent         | 10.8     | 16.9     |                         |\n| Executive remuneration measures                          |                 |          |          |                         |\n| Total compensation expense                               | $Am             | 7,273    | 7,278    | -                       |\n| Compensation expense to income ratio                     | Percent         | 43.1     | 38.1     |                         |\n| Average staff headcount (17)                             |                 | 21,066   | 19,480   | 8%                      |\n| Actual staff headcount (17)                              |                 | 20,666   | 20,509   | 1%                      |\n| CEO awarded profit share                                 | $Am             | 23.75    | 32.00    | (26%)                   |\n| Total Executive KMP awarded profit share                 | $Am             | 80.20    | 151.59   | (47%)                   |\n| Total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share (18) | $Am             | 80.20    | 94.70    | (15%)                   |\n| CEO statutory remuneration                               | $Am             | 29.37    | 30.40    | (3%)                    |\n| Total Executive KMP statutory remuneration               | $Am             | 67.19    | 150.47   | (55%)                   |\n| Total comparable Executive KMP statutory remuneration    | $Am             | 109.51   | 107.78   | 2%                      |\n\n## Performance over past 10 years: FY2015-2024\n\n| Year ended 31 March                   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022    | 2023    | 2024   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Income statement                      |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |         |         |        |\n| NPAT ($Am)                            | 1,604  | 2,063  | 2,217  | 2,557  | 2,982  | 2,731  | 3,015  | 4,706   | 5,182   | 3,522  |\n| Basic EPS (cents per share)           | 502.3  | 619.2  | 657.6  | 758.2  | 883.3  | 791.0  | 842.9  | 1,271.7 | 1,353.7 | 916.6  |\n| Shareholder returns                   |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |         |         |        |\n| Return on equity (%)                  | 14.0   | 14.7   | 15.2   | 16.8   | 18.0   | 14.5   | 14.3   | 18.7    | 16.9    | 10.8   |\n| Ordinary dividends (cents per share)  | 330    | 400    | 470    | 525    | 575    | 430    | 470    | 622     | 750     | 640    |\n| Share price as at 31 March ($A)       | 76.67  | 66.09  | 90.20  | 102.90 | 129.42 | 85.75  | 152.83 | 203.27  | 175.66  | 199.70 |\n| Annual TSR (%) to 31 March (19),(20)  | 40.0   | (9.2)  | 46.0   | 21.3   | 32.8   | (29.9) | 83.9   | 38.6    | (9.8)   | 19.3   |\n| 10 year TSR (%) to 31 March (19),(20) | 187.7  | 83.5   | 99.0   | 257.7  | 723.6  | 220.7  | 628.6  | 1,101.9 | 706.5   | 475.6  |\n\n- (17) Headcount for both FY2024 and FY2023 includes staff employed in certain operationally segregated subsidiaries (OSS).\n- (18) Comparable Executive KMP are KMP who are members of the Executive Committee for the full year in both FY2024 and FY2023.\n- (19) TSR data reflects the reinvestment of gross dividends.\n- (20) Source: Bloomberg.",

The compensation ratio effectively adjusts for differences in size between organisations; however, some companies are or have become part of larger organisations, often with large retail operations that can distort comparisons.\n\nIn the following chart, Macquarie's compensation ratio is compared with that of the international reference group. (26) Macquarie's FY2024 compensation ratio of 43.1% is higher than previous years, as explained above, but remains below the average of our international reference group.\n\n## Compensation expense to income ratio: FY2022-2024 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Data has been calculated by Macquarie.

The Board's view is that we continue to achieve this goal as demonstrated by the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's Executive KMP had an average tenure of 23 years with Macquarie as at 31 March 2024. (28) Their strong leadership and deep expertise have been integral to driving company and business performance in FY2024\n- \u00b7 as at 31 March 2024, 49% of Director-level staff had more than ten years' experience with Macquarie, while a further 24% had between five and ten years' experience with Macquarie (29)\n- \u00b7 the 4% Director-level voluntary turnover rate in FY2024 is lower than the prior year's rate of 5% and well below the voluntary turnover rate across Macquarie overall.

        "page_content": "## Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2024\n\nThis section details the process for determining Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2024 and demonstrates the link between pay and performance.\n\n## Process to determine Executive KMP remuneration outcomes\n\nThere is a consistent and comprehensive process for the Board and the BRC to assess the performance of the CEO and each Executive KMP during the year to enable them to determine remuneration outcomes at the end of the year. The Board is always mindful of the external focus on overall remuneration levels and has spent considerable time determining remuneration outcomes. The BRC recognises the range of expectations and has made decisions that take into consideration the perspectives of all key stakeholders. Significant judgement is applied to ensure that remuneration outcomes are aligned both with individual and company-wide performance and with outcomes delivered to our shareholders, our clients and the communities in which we operate.\n\nAs part of the Board's annual review of the Macquarie CEO's performance, the CEO meets with the Board towards the end of the financial year to consider formal documentation that outlines her views of Macquarie's and her own performance. The presentation includes a broad range of Macquarie's activities covering the following main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 financial/business results\n- \u00b7 risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 business leadership including customer and community outcomes\n- \u00b7 people leadership and professional conduct consistent with the Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For.\n\nOver the course of the year the Board receives regular reports and updates on many of these areas. These are summarised in the CEO's presentation, together with additional information on matters the Board has identified for further discussion as a part of the review process. The Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) of the Board then consider the CEO's performance and progress against all of these topics in determining the CEO's remuneration for the year. A similar process is followed for the CEO of Macquarie Bank focused on MBL-specific measures.\n\nThe MGL CEO annually evaluates the performance of the other Executive KMP and considers the same factors set out above. The Board and the BRC review formal performance assessment documentation for each Executive KMP.\n\nFor the CRO and CFO, the Board and the BRC seek to ensure that their performance and remuneration outcomes reflect the independence and purpose of their functions and have not been unduly influenced by the performance of wider business activities.\n\nThe BRC also considers risk-related matters raised in the independent reports from the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit. To ensure all matters are appropriately brought to the BRC's attention and to achieve an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management, there is a joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and the BGCC.\n\nFinally, the BRC considers remuneration levels for organisations that broadly operate in the same markets and compete for the same people as Macquarie.\n\nAnnual remuneration outcomes reflect:\n\n- \u00b7 achievements against a range of financial and non-financial factors\n- \u00b7 the recognition that our people are our greatest asset, and the importance of retaining key people to encourage innovation and pursue growth opportunities\n- \u00b7 alignment to the outcomes delivered to shareholders\n- \u00b7 risk management, compliance and conduct outcomes.\n\nDetails on specific factors for FY2024 are discussed below.\n\n## Executive KMP fixed remuneration outcomes\n\nIn line with our pay for performance approach to remuneration, fixed remuneration for our Executive KMP in FY2024 comprised approximately 13% of total awarded remuneration, with the balance at risk and explicitly linked to performance.\n\nAs noted in the 2023 Remuneration Report, fixed remuneration for Executive KMP in FY2024 increased for the first time since 2010, other than adjustments made when they were first appointed to the Executive Committee. The fixed remuneration levels in the table below include salary and, for Australia-based Executive KMP, superannuation.\n\n| Role          | FY2023 ($Am)   | FY2024 ($Am)   |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| CEO           | 0.8            | 1.5            |\n| MBL CEO       | 0.7            | 1.3            |\n| Executive KMP | 0.7-0.75       | 1.1 (31)       |\n\nFixed remuneration remains set at a comparatively low level, relative to the industry, and at a lower proportion of total remuneration, but sufficient to avoid inappropriate risk-taking. No increases are planned for FY2025.",

While there were no systemic risk issues identified during the year, a legacy risk matter in MAM was taken into account in determining the MGL CEO's remuneration\n- \u00b7 a focus on streamlining investment programs and driving greater returns on investment, following a period of significant investment in our platform\n- \u00b7 investment in renewable energy solutions at scale, supporting the next wave of climate technologies\n- \u00b7 maintaining strong engagement and focus on meeting regulator expectations including progress against the remediation program with APRA to ensure there is appropriate focus on MBL\n- \u00b7 the refresh of our global employee value proposition to evolve in line with shifts in talent expectations and ensure we accurately reflect the career experience and distinct culture that Macquarie offers.\n\nExecutive KMP remuneration outcomes have also been considered in the context of the wider workforce. The BRC receives extensive reporting on remuneration outcomes and individually reviews and approves the remuneration of staff who hold regulated roles and other senior staff and has reviewed overall total remuneration levels across each business to ensure appropriate distribution of remuneration across the organisation. The BRC has also considered the compensation expense to income ratio as a guide as to whether the share of profits distributed to staff and shareholders is reasonable.\n\nThrough a challenging economic and market environment, we have given careful consideration of all these factors and we believe the following outcomes for the year are appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 CEO awarded profit share has decreased 26% on the prior year to $A23.75 million\n- \u00b7 total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share of $A80.20 million (down 15% on the prior year)\n- \u00b7 PSU allocations of $A4.0 million for the CEO and $A2.8 million for other Executive KMP.\n\n## Link between ESG considerations and remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Board and management recognise the importance of sound ESG practices as part of their responsibility to clients, shareholders, employees and the communities in which Macquarie operates. The Board's and the BRC's assessment of each Executive KMP's performance against the three non-financial performance factors when determining profit share outcomes includes progress on relevant ESG initiatives.\n\nFor ESG considerations relevant to specific Executive KMP, see the commentary on pages 130-139.\n\nIn addition to the process for Executive KMP, ESG considerations are assessed as part of other employees' individual performance and remuneration determinations where relevant to the responsibilities of their role.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information on our ESG approach, including our eight focus areas, is available on pages 53-55 in the ESG section of this Annual Report and at macquari e.com/esg .",

(36) The performance hurdle tests were performed using data sourced from Bloomberg for all companies in the international reference group (as well as Macquarie) and the calculations were reviewed independently.\n\nThe results showed that the performance hurdles:\n\n- \u00b7 based on the EPS CAGR in Macquarie's reported financial year was partially met, and\n- \u00b7 based on Macquarie's relative average annual ROE compared to the international reference group was fully met.\n\nAs a result, 96% of the awards became exercisable on 1 July 2023, as shown below:\n\n|                  | EPS CAGR Hurdle                         | EPS CAGR Hurdle   | ROE Hurdle                              | ROE Hurdle                                                            | ROE Hurdle        |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| PSU tranche      | Macquarie result   (for vesting period) | Outcome           | Macquarie result   (for vesting period) | Hurdle                                                                | Outcome           |\n| 2019   Tranche 2 | 11.26%                                  | 92%  exercisable  | 15.34% (88th percentile)                | 50% above the 50th  percentile (37) 100% at the 75th  percentile (37) | 100%  exercisable |",

The key elements of Macquarie's remuneration governance framework are described below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                        | BOARD                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board Remuneration Committee                                                           | Board Risk Committee, Board Audit Committee & Board Governance and Compliance Committee                               |\n| Oversees remuneration policies and practices,   and makes recommendations to the Board | Discusses any relevant matters that may impact remuneration in a  joint meeting with the Board Remuneration Committee |\n\n## Strong Board oversight\n\nThe Board oversees Macquarie's remuneration framework and its effective application. The Board has a BRC whose objective is to assist the Board with Macquarie's remuneration policies and practices. The BRC currently comprises three independent NEDs as set out earlier in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe BRC members have the required experience and expertise in human resources, remuneration and risk to enable them to achieve effective governance of the remuneration framework. The BRC has a regular meeting cycle and met seven times during FY2024. Attendance at meetings by the BRC members is set out on page 95. Strict processes are in place to ensure conflicts of interest are appropriately managed.\n\nThe MBL BRC (established in 2022) works closely with the BRC to assist the MBL Board with its oversight of remuneration policies and practices applying to staff of Macquarie Bank.\n\n## BRC responsibilities\n\nThe BRC pays close attention to the design and operation of remuneration practices for all Macquarie staff, not just for the most senior executives. The responsibilities of the BRC are outlined in its Charter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Charter is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\nSome of the responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing the process for the annual review by the Board of the CEO's, MBL CEO's and other Executive KMPs' performance\n- \u00b7 recommending to the Board the remuneration outcomes for all Executive KMP, other roles specified under CPS 511 and other senior executives\n- \u00b7 assessing the effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as to support the alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking and professional conduct across the organisation\n- \u00b7 recommending the Remuneration Policy to the Board for approval.\n\n## Alignment to risk\n\nThe BRC liaises with the BRiC, BAC and BGCC to ensure there is effective co-ordination between the Committees to assist in producing an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management.\n\nAs set out on page 122, the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit provide the BRC with independent reports detailing significant risk and internal audit matters (financial and non-financial) including those relating to incidents, issues, and regulatory and litigation matters. A joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and BGCC is held to discuss these matters, with the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit in attendance. The GGC attends as required to provide a further source of independent input, including on matters that might lead to a malus or clawback determination.\n\n## Engagement with external stakeholders\n\nThe Chair of the Board and the BRC Chair undertook a series of meetings with investors and proxy advisors during the year to communicate our remuneration approach and to hear any concerns raised by the investor community.\n\nThey also engaged with APRA during the year regarding Macquarie's implementation of CPS 511.",

Pay Governance has not made any remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The BRC is responsible for making decisions within the terms of its Charter. Pay Governance's terms of engagement set out their independence from members of Macquarie's management. This year, Pay Governance:\n\n- \u00b7 provided information on global remuneration and regulatory trends\n- \u00b7 considered alignment with shareholder interests\n- \u00b7 compared individual remuneration for Executive KMP where relevant comparator company information was available\n- \u00b7 considered Macquarie's overall remuneration approach compared to comparator company organisations.\n\nPay Governance's findings included that:\n\n- \u00b7 the objectives of Macquarie's remuneration framework are similar to those cited by other leading global investment banks\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's remuneration components support its remuneration objectives and principles and are largely consistent with practices at other leading global investment banks, including that performance-based remuneration takes risk management into account.",

        "page_content": "## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe Board seeks to appoint and appropriately remunerate high calibre NEDs. Reflecting the Board's role, the remuneration arrangements applicable to NEDs, as outlined in this section, differ significantly from the arrangements applicable to executives.\n\n## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nNon-Executive Director fees are set acknowledging the level required to appropriately remunerate highly qualified NEDs who have the relevant skills and experience to govern as a member of the Board.\n\nThe NED remuneration framework seeks to remunerate high calibre directors by:\n\n- \u00b7 setting an overall fee that reflects the scale and complexity of Macquarie including additional risk management and regulatory responsibilities and the global financial nature of Macquarie's activities\n- \u00b7 setting Board and Board Committee fees to reflect the time commitment to meet the responsibilities involved in the annual scheduled calendar, taking into account market rates for relevant organisations and market trends\n- \u00b7 paying separate fees for additional responsibilities that may arise on an ad hoc basis\n- \u00b7 delivering these fees in a form that is not contingent on Macquarie's performance\n- \u00b7 setting a minimum shareholding requirement to align the interests of NEDs with MGL shareholders.\n\nThe Board ensures that MGL NED remuneration does not exceed the Macquarie shareholder approved maximum amount. Shareholders approved the current limit ($A5.0 million per annum) at MGL's 2019 AGM. Where MGL NEDs are also members of the MBL Board, their fees include those payable for acting as a director of MBL.\n\nBoard and Board Committee fees are reviewed annually. (38) An internal review of NED fees was completed during the year. The Boards determined, following this review, that Board and Board Committee fees would remain unchanged.\n\nThe CEO is not remunerated separately for acting as an Executive Voting Director.\n\nUnlike Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity, nor are they eligible to receive profit share payments. There are no termination payments to NEDs on their retirement from office other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation contributions comprising part of their remuneration, if any.\n\nNEDs may elect to receive their remuneration, in part, in the form of superannuation contributions over and above the minimum level of contribution required under applicable legislation.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement for Non-Executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with shareholders, the Board has a minimum shareholding requirement for MGL NEDs to have a meaningful direct shareholding in Macquarie.\n\nThe minimum shareholding requirement for:\n\n- \u00b7 NEDs other than the Chair: an investment equivalent to one times the average annual aggregate NED fee for the financial year ending prior to their appointment. Where a MGL NED is also on the MBL Board, this calculation will reflect the aggregate fee for acting as a MGL NED and MBL NED\n- \u00b7 the Chair: an investment equivalent to one times the annual Chair fee. Where the Chair is also the MBL Chair, this calculation will reflect the aggregate fee for the role of MGL Chair and MBL Chair.\n\nThe above requirements are to be met within three years from appointment with one third of the requirement to be held after one year, two thirds after two years and in full after three years.\n\nUnder Macquarie's Trading Policy , NEDs may only trade Macquarie securities during designated trading windows and are prohibited from hedging shares held to meet this minimum shareholding requirement. Each NED's current holding of MGL ordinary shares is included on page 94.\n\nThe annual Board and Board Committee fees are set out in the table below.\n\n| Annual Director Fees (39)                         | Chair  $A (40)   | Member $A   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Board                                             | 935,000          | 275,000     |\n| Board Audit Committee (BAC)                       | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Governance and Compliance  Committee (BGCC) | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Remuneration Committee (BRC)                | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Risk Committee (BRiC)                       | 80,000           | 37,000      |\n| Board Nominating Committee (BNC)                  | n/a              | 18,500      |",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nContinued\n\n## Additional information regarding the statutory remuneration disclosures set out in this Appendix\n\nThe remuneration disclosures set out in this Appendix have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and differ to the additional disclosures set out on pages 130-139.\n\nUnder the requirements of AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures , the remuneration disclosures for the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 only include remuneration relating to the portion of the relevant periods that each person was an Executive KMP.\n\nThe following information provides more detail regarding some of the column headings in this Appendix:\n\n- 1. Short-term employee benefits:\n- (a)  Salary: includes salary, superannuation, any accrual for long service leave and other benefits.\n- (b)  Performance-related remuneration: this represents the cash portion of each person's profit share allocation for the reporting period as an Executive KMP.\n- 2. Long-term employee benefits:\n- (a) Restricted profit share: this represents the amount of retained profit share awarded for the current period that is deferred to future periods and held as a notional investment in Macquarie-managed fund equity (DPS Plan).\n- (b) Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share: Profit share amounts retained under the DPS Plan are notionally invested in Macquarie-managed funds, providing Executive Directors with an economic exposure to the underlying investments. Executive Directors are each entitled to amounts equivalent to the investment earnings (dividends/ distributions and security price appreciation) on the underlying securities. The notional returns are calculated based on Total Shareholder Return. Where these amounts are positive, they may be paid to Executive Directors and are included in these remuneration disclosures as part of 'Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share'. If there is a notional loss, this loss will be offset against any future notional income until the loss is completely offset and is reported as a negative amount in the same column. These earnings reflect the investment performance of the assets in which prior years' retained amounts have been notionally invested. Their inclusion in the individual remuneration disclosures on the previous pages may, therefore, cause distortions when year-on-year remuneration trends are examined. They do not reflect remuneration review decisions made about the individual's current year performance.\n\n- 3. Share-based payments:\n- (a)  Equity awards including shares: This represents the current year expense for retained profit share that is invested in MGL ordinary shares under the MEREP as described on page 115. This is recognised as an expense over the respective vesting periods, or service period if shorter, as described on page 114 and includes amounts relating to prior years equity awards that have been previously disclosed. Equity awards in respect of FY2024 performance will be granted during FY2025; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2023. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2024 and the number of equity awards expected to vest. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each equity award when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period.\n- (b) PSUs: This represents the current year expense for PSUs that is recognised over the vesting period as described on page 117. This includes amounts relating to prior years' PSU awards. PSU awards in respect of FY2024 will be granted during FY2025; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2023. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL  ordinary shares as at 31 March 2024 and the number of PSUs expected to vest. The estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 3.97% per annum (3.99% for grants to the CEO and the MBL CEO), expected vesting date of 1 July 2028 (1 July 2029 for the CEO and the MBL CEO), and a dividend yield of 3.76% per annum. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each PSU when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. Performance hurdles attached to the PSUs allow for PSUs to become exercisable upon vesting only when the relevant performance hurdles are met. The current year expense is reduced for previously recognised remuneration expense where performance hurdles have not been met, have been partially met or are not expected to be met.",

Grants made to Executive KMP prior to their joining the Executive Committee are not disclosed. PSUs are disclosed in a separate table.\n\nA significant portion of an Executive KMP's retained profit share is invested in Macquarie equity, delivered as RSUs. RSUs are units comprising a beneficial interest in MGL ordinary shares held in a trust for the staff member. For further details, refer to Note 32 Employee equity participation to the financial statements in the Financial Report. There have been no alterations to the terms or conditions of the grants set out below since the grant date.\n\nRSU awards are subject to forfeiture as set out on page 115. The maximum potential value of unvested awards could vary significantly and is dependent on the MGL ordinary share price at the time of vesting. Retention rates, the vesting profiles and service and performance criteria for the current year are set out on pages 114-115. RSUs are granted in the financial year following the year of Macquarie's performance to which the grant relates. For example, RSUs granted to KMP in June 2023 relate to their performance in FY2023. All awards that were eligible to vest, vested during the year. No awards were forfeited during the year, other than 615,729 RSU awards held by Mr O'Kane which were forfeited upon his resignation from Macquarie.\n\n| Name and position         | RSU awards granted to date (62)   | Grant date   | Number vested during the year (62),(63)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Executive Voting Director |                                   |              |                                           |\n| S.R.

The accounting fair value of such grants is being amortised and disclosed as part of each KMP's remuneration on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The accounting fair value of $A151.70 at this date has been estimated using a discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe following key assumptions were adopted in determining the value of the PSUs granted:\n\n| Interest rate to maturity   | 4.25% per annum   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Expected vesting dates      | 1 July 2027       |\n| Dividend yield              | 3.54% per annum   |\n\nPSUs have a nil exercise price. PSUs awarded from FY2020 vest in four years as set out on page 117 while PSUs awarded prior to FY2020 vest on a pro-rata basis as set out on page 140, footnote 36. For the 2023 grant, PSUs will vest on 1 July 2027 and expire on 1 August 2032.",

Macquarie Group Limited is a for-profit company for the purposes of preparing this Financial Report.\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this Financial Report are set out in Note 44 Material accounting policies . These policies have been consistently applied to all the financial years presented and are applicable to both the Consolidated Entity (Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries) as well as the Company (Macquarie Group Limited), unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (i) Compliance with IFRS as issued by the IASB\n\nCompliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that this Financial Report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Consequently, this Financial Report is compliant with IFRS.\n\n## (ii) Basis of measurement\n\nThis Financial Report has been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention except for the following items, as disclosed in the respective accounting policy:\n\n- \u00b7 financial instruments (including derivatives) required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments that have been designated as FVTPL (DFVTPL)\n- \u00b7 financial assets and liabilities that are otherwise measured on an amortised cost basis but adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged in qualifying fair value hedge relationships\n- \u00b7 non-current assets and disposal groups that have been classified as held for sale and where a disposal group has been impaired to its fair value less costs to sell\n- \u00b7 commodity inventories that are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption\n- \u00b7 certain other non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, such as investment property.\n\n## (iii) Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of this Financial Report in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements set out areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated Financial Report such as:\n\n- \u00b7 determining the appropriate business model for a group of financial assets which includes determining the level at which the business model condition is applied and whether past or expected sales activity is consistent with a held to collect business model (Note 44(vii))\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the cash flows generated by a financial asset constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) may require the application of judgement, particularly for certain subordinated or non-recourse positions, and in the determination of whether compensation for early termination of a contract is reasonable (Note 44(vii))\n- \u00b7 choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of Expected Credit Loss, including the determination of significant increase in credit risk (SICR), forecasts of economic conditions and the weightings assigned thereto (Note 44(xxii) and Note 13)\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures and investment in subsidiaries, including the reversal thereof (Note 44(i), Note 44(xxii), Note 14 and Note 17)\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and, where applicable, the reversal thereof (Note 44(xxii) and Note 16)\n- \u00b7 determining fair value of assets and liabilities where market-observable inputs are not available including the determination of non-recurring fair values and accounting for day 1 profits or losses for financial instruments (Note 44(vii), Note 44(x) and Note 38)\n- \u00b7 distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired under a business combination, particularly the determination of whether a substantive process exists that, together with an integrated set of activities and assets, significantly contributes to the ability to create an output (Note 44(ii))\n- \u00b7 determination of significant influence over associates, joint control over arrangements and control over subsidiaries, including the assessment of whether certain rights are protective or substantive in nature, whether these rights are held in the capacity as agent or principal, and whether the level of involvement in an investee's relevant activities is sufficient to significantly affect the returns generated (Note 44(i))\n- \u00b7 recoverability of tax receivables, deferred tax assets and measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities can require significant judgement, particularly where the recoverability of such tax balances relies on the estimation of future taxable profits and management's determination of the likelihood that uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority (Note 44(vi), Note 4 and Note 18)\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of certain revenue streams including performance fees from Macquarie-managed funds and other capital market investments and transactions (Note 44(iv))\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of provisions related to actual and potential claims, and the determination of contingent liabilities (Note 44(iv), Note 44(xvii) and Note 33)\n- \u00b7 application of hedge accounting principles, including the assessment that a forecast transaction is highly probable (Note 44(x) and Note 35)\n- \u00b7 determination of the loss of control of a subsidiary, joint control over a joint arrangement or loss of significant influence over an associate including the timing of derecognition of assets and liabilities following the disposal of an investment and, the measurement of the associated gain or loss (Note 44(i)).\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Notwithstanding, it is possible that outcomes within the next financial year differ from management's assumptions and estimates, which may result in an adjustment to the carrying amounts of the reported assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\n(iv) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations that are effective in the current financial year\n\n## (a) AASB 17 Insurance Contracts (AASB 17)\n\nAASB 17 amends the accounting for insurance contracts and replaces AASB 4 Insurance Contracts , AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts .\n\nThe adoption of AASB 17, mandatorily effective for the current annual reporting period did not have a material impact on this Financial Report.\n\n(b) AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (AASB 2023-2)\n\nThe Pillar Two Model Rules are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's inclusive framework designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The Pillar Two Model Rules:\n\n- \u00b7 aim to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum amount of tax on income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate; and\n- \u00b7 would achieve that aim by applying a system of top-up taxes that results in the total amount of taxes payable on Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBE) income in each jurisdiction representing at least the minimum rate of 15%.\n\n## The Consolidated Entity's Pillar Two Project\n\nDuring 2022, the Consolidated Entity initiated a project to manage the impact of the Pillar Two rules globally. The project's scope is to ensure the Consolidated Entity and its subsidiaries can meet their Pillar Two compliance obligations.\n\nAs part of the project, the Consolidated Entity is monitoring the progress of the implementation of the model rules into domestic legislation and certain jurisdictions in which the Consolidated Entity has operations and have started to enact the rules generally with operational effect from the Consolidated Entity's 31 March 2025 financial year.\n\n## Impacts on financial reporting\n\nIn June 2023, the AASB issued AASB 2023-2 which makes amendments to AASB 112 Income Taxes with immediate effect. The standard provides a mandatory temporary exception to accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Consolidated Entity has applied this exception in preparing its annual Financial Report.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity will ultimately be subject to Pillar Two legislation in various jurisdictions. Applicable Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date and as a result the Consolidated Entity has no related current tax exposure as at 31 March 2024.\n\nDue to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income and covered taxes, the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation has to date been estimated using historical data over a number of years. Based on this assessment it is not anticipated that there will be a material impact to current tax expense of the Consolidated Entity or the Company on implementation of the changes. The impact of the Pillar Two income taxes legislation on future financial performance will continue to be assessed.\n\n## (c) Other amendments made to existing standards\n\nThe amendments made to other existing standards that were mandatorily effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 April 2023 did not result in a material impact on this Financial Report.\n\n(v) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that are not yet effective for the financial year\n\n## (i) IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n\nIn April 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18) which sets out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in general purpose financial statements. IFRS 18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The transition provisions of IFRS 18 require retrospective application. The AASB is expected to issue the Australian equivalent of the standard in June 2024. The Consolidated Entity is continuing to assess the full impact of adopting IFRS 18.\n\n## (ii) Other amendments made to existing standards\n\nOther amendments to existing standards that are not mandatorily effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 April 2023 and have not been early adopted, are not likely to result in a material impact to the Consolidated Entity's financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1\n\n## Basis of preparation continued\n\n## (vi) Other developments\n\n## (a) ISSB sustainability reporting standards\n\nDuring the year, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published the following sustainability reporting standards:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainabilityrelated Financial Information (IFRS S1), which sets out the overall requirements for sustainability-related financial disclosures, and\n- \u00b7 IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2), which will require the disclosure of information that enables the users of financial statements to understand the reporting entity's governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn Australia, the proposed sustainability standards have been issued for exposure and comment while proposed legislation has been tabled in Parliament under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 (Cth). In the present form, these requirements would have the Consolidated Entity commence reporting for its financial year commencing on 1 April 2025. The Consolidated Entity acknowledges the growing importance of sustainability-related disclosures and continues to progress its established project to assess and prepare for future sustainability and climate-related reporting obligations.\n\n## (b) IBOR reform: Transition from interbank offered rates (IBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs)\n\nIBOR interest rate benchmarks that are used in a wide variety of financial instruments (such as derivatives and lending arrangements) have undergone, or are undergoing, reform. The nature of such reforms varies by benchmark and jurisdiction.\n\nIBOR including the GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF and USD London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), as well as IBOR for certain other minor currencies, have ceased publication. The Consolidated Entity's IBOR reform project oversaw the transition of such exposures and the Consolidated Entity ceased the use of LIBOR in new products in accordance with industry and regulatory guidance.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity continues to have certain exposures referencing IBOR undergoing reform (including the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate (CDOR) and Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE)). Information regarding these exposures is disclosed in Note 36.3 Market Risk .\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The financial information is reported on the same basis as used internally by Senior Management for evaluating Operating Segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to Operating Segments. Such information may be produced using different measures to that used in preparing the statutory income statement.\n\nFor internal reporting, performance measurement and risk management purposes, the Consolidated Entity is divided into Operating Groups and a Corporate segment (reportable segments).\n\nThe financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\nThese segments have been set up based on the different core products and services offered. The Operating Groups comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 MAM which provides investment solutions to clients across a range of capabilities including real assets, real estate, credit, equities & multi-asset and secondaries\n- \u00b7 BFS which provides a diverse range of personal banking, wealth management and business banking products and services to retail clients, advisers, brokers and business clients\n- \u00b7 CGM which is a global business offering capital and financing, risk management, market access, physical execution and logistics solutions to its diverse client base across Commodities, Financial Markets and Asset Finance\n- \u00b7 Macquarie Capital which has global capability in advisory and capital raising services, providing clients with specialist expertise and flexible capital solutions across a range of sectors. It also has global capability in specialist investing across private credit, private equity, real estate, growth equity, venture capital, and in infrastructure and energy projects and companies. Macquarie Capital's Equities brokerage business provides clients with access to equity research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access.\n\nThe Corporate segment, which is not considered an Operating Group, comprises head office and Central Service Groups, and holds certain legacy and strategic investments, assets and businesses that are not allocated to any of the Operating Groups.\n\nItems of income and expense within the Corporate segment include the net result of managing Macquarie's liquidity and funding requirements, earnings on capital and the residual accounting volatility relating to economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is applied, as well as accounting volatility for other economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is not applicable.\n\nOther items of income and expense within the Corporate segment include earnings from investments, changes in central overlays to credit and other impairments or valuation of assets, provisions for legacy matters, unallocated head office costs and costs of Central Service Groups. The Corporate segment also includes performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense and income tax expense.\n\nBelow is a selection of key policies applied in determining the Operating Segment results.\n\n## Internal funding arrangements\n\nGroup Treasury has the responsibility for managing wholesale funding for the Consolidated Entity, and Operating Groups obtain their required funding from Group Treasury. The Operating Groups are assumed to be fully debt funded for the purposes of internal funding charges. The interest rates charged by Group Treasury are determined by the currency and term of the funding.\n\nGenerally, with the exception of deposit funding, Operating Groups may only source funding directly from external sources where the funding is secured by the Operating Group's assets. In such cases, Operating Groups bear the funding costs directly and Group Treasury may levy additional charges, where appropriate.\n\n## Transactions between Operating Segments\n\nOperating Segments that enter into arrangements with other Operating Segments must do so on commercial terms or as agreed by the Consolidated Entity's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.\n\nInternal transactions are recognised in each of the relevant categories of income and expense and eliminated on consolidation as appropriate.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Changes in the fair value are presented in net trading income and give rise to income statement volatility unless designated in hedge accounting relationships. If designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships, the carrying value of the hedged items are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risks to reduce volatility in the income statement. If designated in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, the effective portion of the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as part of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and subsequently recognised in the income statement at the time at which the hedged items affect the income statement for the hedged risks. For segment reporting, derivatives are accounted for on an accrual basis in the results of the Operating Groups to the extent that the Corporate segment manages the derivative volatility, either through the application of hedge accounting or where the derivative volatility may offset the volatility of other positions managed within the Corporate segment.\n\n## Central Service Groups\n\nThe Central Service Groups provide a range of functions supporting MGL's Operating Groups, ensuring they have the appropriate workplace support and systems to operate effectively and the necessary resources to meet their regulatory, compliance, financial, legal and risk management requirements.\n\nCentral Service Groups recover their costs from Operating Groups generally on either a time and effort allocation basis or a fee for service basis. Central Service Groups include the Corporate Operations Group (COG), Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk Management Group (RMG), Legal and Governance Group (LGG) and Central Executive.\n\n## Performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense\n\nPerformance-related profit share and share-based payments expense relating to the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP) are recognised in the Corporate segment and are not allocated to Operating Groups.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe income tax expense and benefit is recognised in the Corporate segment and are not allocated to the Operating Groups. However, to recognise an Operating Group's contribution to permanent income tax differences, the internal management revenue/charge category is used.\n\nThis internal management revenue/charge category, which is primarily used for permanent income tax differences generated by the Operating Groups, is offset by an equal and opposite amount recognised in the Corporate segment such that they are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Presentation of segment income statements\n\nThe income statements on the following pages for each of the reported segments are in some cases summarised by grouping non-material balances together. Where appropriate, all material or key balances have been reported separately to provide users with information relevant to the understanding of the Consolidated Entity's financial performance. The financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\n## Reportable segment assets\n\nSegment assets are the external operating assets that are employed by a segment in its operating activities.",

The DRP is optional and offers ordinary shareholders in Australia and New Zealand the opportunity to acquire fully paid ordinary shares without transaction costs. A shareholder can elect to participate in or terminate their involvement in the DRP at any time. Ordinary shares purchased on the market or issued by the Consolidated Entity under the DRP in the current and prior year were allocated as fully paid ordinary shares pursuant to the DRP, details of which are included in Note 27 Contributed equity .\n\n## (ii) Dividends not recognised at the end of the financial year\n\nSince the end of the financial year, the Directors have resolved to pay a final dividend of $3.85 per fully paid ordinary share, 40% franked based on tax paid at 30%. The aggregate amount of the proposed dividend expected to be paid on 2 July 2024 from retained profits, but not recognised as a liability at the end of the financial year is $1,471 million.

These models incorporate a range of components notably that of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) ('credit inputs') as well as Forward-Looking Information (FLI).\n\nFor retail portfolios, behavioural variables are also considered in the determination of inputs for ECL modelling.\n\nThe key model inputs used in measuring the ECL include:\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD): The EAD represents the estimated exposure in the event of a default\n- \u00b7 Probability of Default (PD): The calculation of PDs for retail and wholesale exposures is generally performed at a facility level. Retail exposures are segmented based on product type and shared characteristics that are highly correlated to credit risk such as region, product, counterparty groupings, loan-to-value ratio and other similar criteria. Wholesale portfolio PDs are a function of industry type, internal credit ratings and transition matrices used to determine a point in time PD estimate. PD estimates for both retail and wholesale portfolios are also adjusted for FLI\n- \u00b7 Loss Given Default (LGD): The LGD associated with the PD used is the magnitude of the ECL in a default event. The LGD is estimated using historical loss rates considering relevant factors for individual exposures or portfolios.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically assesses exposures to determine whether there has been a SICR, which may be evidenced by either qualitative or quantitative factors. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to material change in internal credit rating or whether an exposure has been identified and placed on CreditWatch, an internal credit monitoring mechanism supervised by Senior Management to closely monitor exposures showing signs of stress. All exposures on CreditWatch are classified as Stage II or, if defaulted, as Stage III.\n\nSICR thresholds, which require judgement, are used to determine whether an exposure's credit risk has increased significantly. The SICR methodology is based on a relative credit risk approach which considers changes in an underlying exposure's credit risk since origination. This may result in exposures being classified in Stage II that are of a higher credit quality than other similar exposures that are classified as Stage I. Accordingly, while similar increases in the quantum of Stage II exposures will suggest a relative deterioration of credit quality, it should not necessarily be inferred that the assets are of a lower credit quality.\n\n## Retail exposures\n\nExposures are assigned a behavioural score which considers the exposures' lifetime PD on initial recognition. This behavioural score is periodically assessed and updated to reflect changes in the underlying exposures' credit behaviour. SICR movement thresholds between origination and reporting date of behavioural score movements have been established that, where exceeded, result in the exposure being categorised as Stage II.\n\n## Wholesale exposures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity assigns an internal credit rating to each exposure at origination based on information available at that date. These internal ratings are broadly aligned to external credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\n\nWhere an exposures' assigned credit rating deteriorates beyond pre-defined thresholds per credit rating at origination, the exposure is categorised as Stage II. The methodology has been calibrated so that a larger change in rating is required for higher quality credit rated exposures than for lower quality credit rated exposures to be classified as Stage II.\n\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 the AASB 9 'low credit risk' exemption is not applied by the Consolidated Entity to material portfolios\n- \u00b7 for material retail portfolios, the credit risk for an exposure or portfolio is generally deemed to have increased significantly if the exposure is more than 30 days past due, unless there are product specific characteristics that indicate that this threshold should be rebutted.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's definition of default determines the reference point for the calculation of the ECL components, and in particular the PD. Default is generally defined as the point when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Consolidated Entity to actions such as realisation of available security; or the borrower is 90 days or more past due on an obligation to the Consolidated Entity.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13\n\n## Expected credit losses continued\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically monitors its exposures for potential indicators of default such as significant financial difficulty of the borrower including breaches of lending covenants; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.\n\n## Forward-looking information (FLI)\n\nThe inclusion of FLI in calculating ECL allowances adjusts the PD, the determination of SICR in retail portfolios as well as the LGD (that is relevant to the determination of the recovery rates on collateral). The predicted relationships between these key indicators and the key model components (EAD, PD and LGD) in measuring the ECL have been developed by analysing historical data as part of the development of internal models, and the calibration and validation process.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies its professional judgement in determining whether there are any inherent risks in the models' predictive outcomes. The overlays primarily reflect management's assessment of the current economic and credit environment relative to the FLI credit cycle model. These overlays account for the risk that underlying credit risk events have occurred, but observable modelled inputs are yet to reflect those events, as well as risks that are specific to regions, counterparties or industries which are difficult to account for within the modelled outcomes. Over time the credit models are recalibrated to enhance the predictive capability. At the reporting date this overlay was approximately $175 million (2023: $475 million). These judgements are reviewed by FMG and RMG at each reporting date.\n\nRMG is responsible for the FLI including the development of scenarios and recommending the range of probability weights to apply to those scenarios. For this purpose, four possible economic scenarios have been developed for this period, being an upside, downside, severe downside and baseline scenario. In calculating the ECL, each of the scenarios is probability weighted and then applied to the exposures' PDs and LGDs.\n\nThe scenarios have been developed using a combination of publicly available data, internal forecasts and third-party information to form the initial baseline. Internal specialists within the Consolidated Entity are consulted to assist in refining and challenging the baseline and the alternative scenarios. For the current reporting period, the Consolidated Entity has generated three alternative scenarios in addition to the baseline scenario, where the alternative scenarios are anchored to the baseline on a relative basis.\n\nRefinement of the scenarios includes benchmarking to external data from reputable sources. These sources include, forecasts published from a range of market economists and official data sources, including major central banks, where available.\n\nWhere there are limited official data sources against which to benchmark key economic indicators on a forward-looking basis, management exercises judgement when determining the duration, severity and impact of the macroeconomic scenarios used by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nAssigning probabilities to these scenarios requires professional judgement. This judgement draws on internal risk and economics specialist input, comparison to general market outlooks and publicly available market commentary.\n\nThe scenarios and the associated probabilities are ultimately approved by senior risk and finance executives.\n\nThe scenarios for each of the key regions where the Consolidated Entity's ECL is derived have been set out on the following pages. Noting the diversity of possible scenarios and macroeconomic outcomes, and the continuing uncertainty regarding the implications of geopolitical events, broader inflationary pressures and the path of monetary policy, these scenarios represent plausible forward-looking views as at the reporting date.\n\nThese scenarios impact the modelled ECL provisioning levels through determination of probabilities of default and determination of losses that may be incurred should a default occur. The ability of borrowers to service their obligations through personal or business income is generally estimated using unemployment rates, GDP, commodity prices and interest rates. The losses that the Consolidated Entity may incur should a default occur, and the collateral utilised is generally estimated through property price and share price index outlooks.\n\nFuture economic conditions may differ to the scenarios outlined, the impact of which will be accounted for in future reporting periods.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. Where required, the recoverable amount is determined either with reference to external valuations or estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. In this case, estimates specific to the asset or CGU are required to be determined, including forecast cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates (ranged from 10.5%-13.0%). There was no material impairment or reversal of existing impairment recognised during the year.\n\nThe movement in the carrying value of the Consolidated Entity's intangible assets is as follows.\n\n|                                                   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH  INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH  INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES   | INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES   |       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n|                                                   | Goodwill                                          | Management  rights                                | Management  rights and  licenses             | Customer and  servicing  contracts           | Software and  other  Intangibles             | Total |\n|                                                   | $m                                                | $m                                                | $m                                           | $m                                           | $m                                           | $m    |\n| Balance as at 1 Apr 2022                          | 1,863                                             | 276                                               | 1,167                                        | 387                                          | 87                                           | 3,780 |\n| Acquisitions 2                                    | 161                                               | -

Additionally, these include the major employing entities, entities that are key providers of funding to other subsidiaries and other operating entities considered key for each Operating Group and region.\n\nThe list of notable subsidiaries has been categorised based on the geographic region of their incorporation. The country of incorporation has been stated in brackets. For entities in the Australia region, the country of incorporation is Australia. Overseas subsidiaries and their branches conduct business predominantly in the place of incorporation and location of their branches. Notable subsidiaries may conduct business in other geographic regions through branches. The branches have not been separately included in the list of notable subsidiaries.\n\nAll notable subsidiaries have a 31 March reporting date, except for specific cases covered above.\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\nDuring the year, the Company's subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends, accessing or using assets and settling liabilities of the Group. There are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to the Group depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nDetails of non-controlling interest are covered in Note 28 Reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests .",

Internally, the Consolidated Entity has developed an Economic Capital Adequacy Model (ECAM) that complements the management of specific risk types such as equity, credit, market and operational risk by providing an aggregate view of the Consolidated Entity's risk profile. Externally, the Consolidated Entity is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by APRA.\n\nMeasures of capital used to support business decision-making include:\n\n- \u00b7 capital adequacy assessment\n- \u00b7 risk appetite setting\n- \u00b7 risk-adjusted performance measurement\n\n## Regulatory capital framework\n\nRegulatory capital requirements are imposed and measured at three levels of consolidation within the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: MBL and certain subsidiaries which meet the APRA definition of Extended Licensed Entities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2: MBL, its subsidiaries and its immediate parent less certain subsidiaries of MBL which are deconsolidated for APRA reporting purposes. These include entities conducting insurance, funds management and non-financial operations.\n- \u00b7 Level 3: The Level 2 group, other bank entities excluded from Level 2 plus the Non-Bank Group. In determining the capital requirements, transactions internal to the Consolidated Entity are eliminated.\n\nMBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is an APRA regulated ADI and is subject to the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standard requirements. MBL is accredited by APRA to apply the Basel III Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approach for credit risk and the Internal Model Approach for market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nThe Company and Consolidated Entity, as an APRA authorised and regulated NOHC, is regulated on a Level 3 basis and is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital calculated as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 MBL's minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, based on a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) plus Tier 1 deductions per the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standards.\n- \u00b7 The Non-Bank Group capital requirement, per the Consolidated Entity's ECAM.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Level 3 eligible capital consists of ordinary equity, retained earnings, certain reserves and hybrid instruments. The overall Level 3 capital position is reported as an excess over the regulatory minimum capital adequacy requirement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has complied with minimum capital requirements at Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 throughout the financial year.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

lenders that provide that, in the event of liquidation, entitlement of such lenders to repayment of the principal sum and interest thereon is and shall at all times be and remain subordinated to the rights of all other present and future creditors of the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe table below highlights key capital instruments with conditional repayment obligations (Tier 1 loan capital) issued

A MEREP participant holding a DSU has no right or interest in any share until the DSU is exercised. The Company may issue shares to the Trustee or direct the Trustee to acquire shares on-market, or via a share acquisition arrangement for potential future allocations to holders of DSUs.\n\nGenerally, where permitted by law, DSUs will provide for cash payments in lieu of dividends paid on MGL ordinary shares before the DSU is exercised. Further, the number of shares underlying a DSU will be adjusted upon any bonus issue or other capital reconstruction of the Company in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules, so that the holder of a DSU does not receive a benefit that holders of the Company's shares do not generally receive. These provisions are intended to provide the holders of DSUs, as far as possible, with the same benefits and risks as holders of RSUs. However, holders of DSUs will have no voting rights with respect to any underlying MGL ordinary shares.\n\nDSUs will only be offered in jurisdictions where legal or tax rules make the grant of RSUs impractical, or where PSUs are structured as DSUs (see PSUs). DSUs have been granted with an expiry period of up to nine years.\n\n|                                                      | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                      | 2024                   | 2023                   |\n| DSUs on issue at the beginning of the financial year | 4,178,466              | 3,471,835              |\n| Granted during the financial year                    | 1,391,808              | 1,379,684              |\n| Exercised during the financial year                  | (1,121,323)            | (609,485)              |\n| Forfeited during the financial year                  | (113,925)              | (63,568)               |\n| DSUs on issue at the end of the financial year       | 4,335,026              | 4,178,466              |\n| DSUs exercisable at the end of the financial year    | 1,290,695              | 1,373,742              |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of the DSU awards granted during the financial year was $171.68 (2023: $159.14).",

Only members of the MGL and MBL Executive Committees are eligible to receive PSUs. For the PSUs allocated to Executive Committee Members, two performance hurdles have been determined and each will apply individually to 50% of the total number of PSUs awarded. Hurdles are periodically reviewed by the Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance groups, shareholders and regulators as well as market practice. No change has been made to the hurdles for this financial year.\n\n## The hurdles are outlined below.\n\n## Performance hurdle 1\n\n| Hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                | Reference group                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 50% of the PSUs based solely on the relative average annual return on  ordinary equity (ROE) over the vesting period compared to a reference group  of global financial institutions. | The current reference group comprises Bank of America Corporation, Barclays  PLC, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan  Chase & Co., Lazard Limited, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG. 5 |\n| Performance hurdle 2                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                | Required result                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nUnder both performance hurdles, the condition is examined once only. Testing occurs annually on 30 June immediately before vesting on 1 July, based on the most recent financial year-end results available. To the extent that a condition is not met when examined, the PSUs due to vest will not be exercisable upon vesting, resulting in no benefit to Executive Committee members.\n\n## Pre-vest assessment (At end of vesting period) 4\n\nPrior to vesting of PSU awards, the Board will conduct a holistic assessment of the Executive Committee's collective contribution to driving the performance of Macquarie over the vesting period, based on the extent to which the Executive Committee has:\n\n- 1. promoted behaviour that is consistent with and reflects Macquarie's risk culture and Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For\n- 2. overseen the effectiveness of Macquarie's risk management framework, policies and practices in managing key financial and non-financial risks\n- 3. overseen funding, liquidity and capital management to ensure Macquarie's financial soundness.\n\nWhere the Board forms a negative overall assessment of the relevant Executive Committee's collective contribution, it may consider whether an adjustment is appropriate, taking into account any mitigating and aggravating factors.\n\nTo assist the Board with their determination of an adjustment to the PSU vesting outcome, and to ensure that the determination encompasses all relevant considerations, the BRC will receive reporting over the vesting period.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

This amount is recognised as an expense over the respective vesting periods.\n\nRSUs, DSUs and PSUs relating to the MEREP plan for Executive Committee members have been granted in the current financial year in respect of the 2023 performance. The accounting fair value of each of these grants is estimated using the Company's share price on the date of grant and for each PSU also incorporates a discounted cash flow method using the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 interest rate to maturity: 4.25% per annum\n- \u00b7 expected vesting dates of PSUs: 1 July 2027\n- \u00b7 dividend yield: 3.54% per annum.\n\nWhile RSUs, DSUs and PSUs (for Executive Committee members) for FY2024 will be granted during FY2025, the Company begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2023 related to these future grants. The expense is estimated using the estimated MEREP retention for FY2024 and applying the amortisation profile to the retained amount.\n\nFor PSU, the estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 3.97% per annum (3.99% for grants to the CEO and the MBL CEO), expected vesting date of 1 July 2028 (1 July 2029 for the CEO and the MBL CEO), and a dividend yield of 3.76% per annum. In the following financial year, the Consolidated Entity will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of fair value for each RSU, DSU and PSU when granted and will use this valuation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. The Consolidated Entity annually reviews its estimates of the number of awards (including those delivered through MEREP) that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the employment expenses in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity (for equity settled awards), or a corresponding adjustment to liabilities (for cash settled awards).\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2024, compensation expense relating to the MEREP totalled $831,043 thousand (2023: $760,289 thousand).\n\nFor the equity settled awards, the estimated future withholding tax outflow is $642,312 thousand (2023: $534,218 thousand).\n\n## Employee Share Plan\n\nThe Consolidated Entity continues to operate the Macquarie Group Employee Share Plan (ESP) whereby each financial year eligible employees are offered up to $1,000 worth of fully paid MGL ordinary shares for no cash consideration.\n\nShares allocated under the ESP cannot be sold until the earlier of three years after allocation or the time when the participant is no longer employed by the Consolidated Entity. In all other respects, shares allocated rank equally with all other fully paid ordinary shares then on issue.\n\nThe latest offer under the ESP was made during November 2023. A total of 2,391 (2023: 2,195) staff participated in this offer.\n\nOn 1 December 2023, the participants were each allocated 6 (2023: 5) fully paid ordinary shares based on the offer amount of $1,000 and the average market share price of $166.34 (2023: $178.23), resulting in a total of 14,346 (2023: 10,975) shares being allocated. The shares were allocated to staff for no cash consideration. The aggregate value of the shares allocated was deducted from staff profit share and commissions.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2024, compensation expense relating to the ESP totalled $2,388 thousand (2023: $1,968 thousand).\n\n## Other plans\n\nThe Consolidated Entity operates other local share-based compensation plans, none of which, individually or in aggregate are material.\n\n## Shares purchased on-market/issued for the purpose of an employee incentive scheme\n\nDuring the financial year ended 31 March 2024, the Consolidated Entity purchased 3,180,994 (2023: 3,600,455) shares on-market and 2,556,543 (2023: 1,870,038) shares via off-market transfer from its employees during the Staff Trading window for MEREP. A further 14,346 (2023: 10,975) shares were purchased on-market for the ESP. The average price of all shares purchased during the financial year was $179.14 (2023: $168.83) and the average price of the purchases made on-market was $182.84 (2023: $162.70).",

SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well-defined objectives. SEs are classified as subsidiaries and are consolidated when control exists.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages with SEs for securitisation, asset-backed financing and structured financing arrangements in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The Consolidated Entity also engages with SEs when providing investment management and other fiduciary activities. The Consolidated Entity's involvement with SEs is primarily of the following nature.\n\n| Type                                            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Securitisations                                 | Securitisations involve transferring assets into a vehicle that sells beneficial interests to investors through the issue  of debt and equity notes with varying levels of subordination. The notes are collateralised by the assets transferred  to these vehicles and pay a return based on the returns of those assets, with residual returns paid to the most  subordinated investor.                                                                                         |\n| Asset-backed financing                          | Asset-backed vehicles are used to provide tailored lending for the purchase or lease of assets transferred by the  Consolidated Entity or its clients. The assets are normally pledged as collateral to the lenders. The Consolidated  Entity engages in raising finance for assets such as vessels, electronic and IT equipment.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Structured financing and  other arrangements    | Includes: \u00b7 financing for prepaid commodity delivery contracts.

These exposures are typically managed under credit and market risk limits described in Note 36.1 Credit risk and Note 36.3 Market risk . For these reasons, information on the size and structure for these SEs is not considered meaningful for understanding the related risks, and have not been presented in the table above.\n\nIn respect of the Consolidated Entity's loan assets exposure in securitisation, asset-backed financing entities and structured financing, the total size of the unconsolidated SEs is $74,580 million (2023: $44,114 million). Size is based on the latest available information representing either the total assets of the SE (measured either at amortised cost excluding impairments or fair values if readily available), outstanding notional of issued notes or the principal amount of liabilities if there is nominal equity.\n\nFor the above exposures, the Consolidated Entity does not sponsor or control these SEs, nor is it a significant user of the services of these SEs.\n\nAdditionally, as part of its funds management and administration activities the Consolidated Entity has interests in certain funds including investments, receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments which represent the Consolidated Entity's maximum exposure to loss. In certain cases the Consolidated Entity invests alongside its own managed funds to demonstrate further alignment with investors. The carrying value of the Consolidated Entity's investments in funds is disclosed in Note 14 Interests in associates and joint ventures . Interests in the nature of receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments are disclosed in Note 30 Related party information and Note 11 Other assets . The Assets Under Management (AUM) of $938.3 billion (2023: $878.6 billion) represent the indicative size of these funds and is measured as the proportional ownership interest in the underlying assets of funds and mandated assets that Macquarie actively manages or advises on. Private Markets AUM includes equity yet to deploy.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The Consolidated Entity's objective is to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings, within pre-defined thresholds. This volatility is managed through designation of hedge accounting relationships and the use of naturally offsetting positions in the income statement.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nDetail on hedging instruments, the nature of hedged risks, as well as the notional and the carrying amount of derivative financial instruments and, in the case of hedges of net investment in foreign operations, the notional of foreign currency denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items, for each type of hedge relationship, is shown in the respective sections. The maturity profile for the hedging instruments' notional amounts are reported based on their contractual maturity. Where a cross currency swap has been dual designated in both a cash flow and a fair value hedge, the notional is shown more than once. Increases in notional profiles of hedging instruments are presented as negative figures, with decreases and maturities presented as positive figures.\n\n## Hedging ineffectiveness\n\nIn the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument differ to that of the hedged item for the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. In the case of hedges of net investment in foreign operations, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness primarily arise from basis and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments, and designating existing derivatives with a non-zero fair value as hedging instruments. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in net trading income in the income statement.",

Changes in this reserve are reported in the Consolidated Entity's statements of comprehensive income. The cumulative gains and losses remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve for hedging relationships that have ceased, but for which the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur is $1 million gain (2023: $2 million gain) for the Consolidated Entity and $nil (2023: $nil) for the Company. This amount will be transferred to the income statement when the hedged item affects profit and loss.\n\nHedging instruments\n\n|                                         |                  | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Instrument type                         | Risk category    | Less than 3  months $m           | 3 to 12  months $m               | 1 to 5 years $m                  | Over 5 years $m                  | Total $m                         |\n|                                         |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  | CONSOLIDATED 2024                | CONSOLIDATED 2024                |\n| Derivative assets                       |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | Foreign exchange | 31                               | 91                               | 1,371                            | 1,245                            | 2,738                            |\n| Interest rate swaps and options         | Interest rate    | 10                               | 140                              | 3,702                            | 824                              | 4,676                            |\n| Derivative liabilities                  |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | Foreign exchange | -

The risk of changes in the NIFO for movements in foreign exchange rates may be hedged by the Consolidated Entity using a combination of derivatives, foreign currency denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items. Refer to Note 36 Financial risk management : Non-traded risk for further information on the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy.\n\nIn order to reflect the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy, hedge accounting is applied where changes in the derivatives and foreign denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items are recognised, together with the related foreign currency translation reserve, in the Consolidated Entity's other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to the income statement or re-attributed within equity as defined in Note 44(iii) Foreign currency translation : Subsidiaries and other equities . Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recognised in the income statement. Given that the Consolidated Entity's NIFO frequently changes, the hedge designations are reviewed on a monthly basis or more frequently where required.\n\n|                                                                                          |                  | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                                                          |                  | ASSET                          | ASSET                          | LIABILITY                      | LIABILITY                      |\n|                                                                                          |                  | 2024                           | 2023                           | 2024                           | 2023                           |\n| Hedging instrument                                                                       | Risk category    | $m                             | $m                             | $m                             | $m                             |\n| Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign  currency denominated balance sheet items 2 | Foreign exchange | 386                            | 989                            | 98                             | 128                            |\n| Foreign currency denominated borrowings                                                  | Foreign exchange | -                              | -                              | 24,105                         | 22,282                         |\n\n|                                                                                        |                  | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                                        |                  | ASSET                   | ASSET                   | LIABILITY               | LIABILITY               |\n|                                                                                        |                  | 2024                    | 2023                    | 2024                    | 2023                    |\n| Hedging instrument                                                                     | Risk category    | $m                      | $m                      | $m                      | $m                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign  currency denominated balance sheet items | Foreign exchange | 4,949                   | 4,437                   | 2,541                   | 2,966                   |\n| Foreign currency denominated borrowings                                                | Foreign exchange | -                       | -                       | 23,958                  | 22,155                  |\n\nIn order to hedge the currency exposure of certain net investments in foreign operations, the Consolidated Entity jointly designates hedging instruments from the currency of the underlying foreign operation to USD and then the hedging instruments from USD to AUD. As a result, the notional value of hedging instruments presented in the table above of $31,448 million (2023: $29,558 million) represents the notional of Foreign currency denominated borrowings, Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign currency denominated balance sheet items. The notional of the underlying hedged component of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations is $24,486 million (2023: $23,001 million).\n\nHedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the absolute change in either the fair value of the derivative or the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated borrowings attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds that of the hedged item. There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement by the Consolidated Entity in the current year (2023: $nil).",

In an effective fair value hedge relationship, movements in this fair value adjustment are largely offset by movements in the fair value of the hedging instrument.

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Risk Management Group\n\nRisk is an integral part of the Consolidated Entity's businesses. The material risks faced by the Consolidated Entity include aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks.\n\nThe primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. An important part of the role of all staff throughout Macquarie is to ensure they manage risks appropriately.\n\nRMG is independent of other areas of the Consolidated Entity. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions. RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the Board. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie's CRO, is a member of the Executive Committee of MGL and MBL and reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the Board Risk Committee. Further details on the Risk Management Framework in the Consolidated Entity can be found in the Risk Management Report of this Annual Report.\n\n## Note 36.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to complete its contractual obligations when they fall due. The consequential loss is the amount of the financial obligation not paid back, or the loss incurred in replicating a trading contract with a new counterparty.\n\n## Credit risk assessment and approval\n\nExercise of credit authority within Macquarie is undertaken under authority delegated by the MGL and MBL Boards directly.\n\nCredit risk assessment includes a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the counterparty and related entities, key risk and mitigants, and that the downside risk is properly understood and acceptable.\n\nAfter this analysis is undertaken, limits are set for an acceptable level of potential exposure. All wholesale limits and ratings are reviewed at least once a year or more frequently if required.\n\nRetail credit exposures are monitored by the business units and overseen by RMG Credit on a portfolio basis.\n\nAll credit exposures are monitored regularly against limits. For limit monitoring, credit exposures for loan assets are reported at amortised cost. Derivative exposures are measured using high confidence potential future underlying asset prices.\n\nTo mitigate credit risk, where appropriate, the Consolidated Entity makes use of margining and other forms of collateral or credit enhancement techniques (including guarantees, letters of credit and the purchase of credit default swaps).\n\n## Ratings and reviews\n\nRefer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for details regarding the manner in which the Consolidated Entity has adopted and applied AASB 9's expected credit loss impairment requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the credit risk associated with assets on the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9, the following methodology has been adopted.\n\n## Wholesale rating\n\nMacquarie wholesale ratings broadly correspond to Standard & Poor's credit ratings as follows.\n\n| Credit  Profile      | Internal  Rating   | Standard & Poor's  Equivalent   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Investment grade     | MQ1 to MQ8         | AAA to BBB-                     |\n| Non-investment grade | MQ9 to MQ16        | BB+ to C                        |\n| Default              | MQ99               | Default                         |\n\n## Retail rating\n\nRetail pools are mapped to the credit quality grades based on their PDs.\n\nMapping retail portfolios to the credit grades has been done for comparability of the overall portfolio presentation and does not reflect the way that the retail portfolio is segmented for management purposes. Management reviews a range of information, including past due status for the portfolio, to assess the credit quality of these assets.\n\n## Due from subsidiaries\n\nBalances with subsidiaries are mapped to the rating grades assigned internally to these counterparties for the pricing of internal funding arrangements on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Portfolio and country risk\n\nA review of the credit portfolio analysing credit concentrations by counterparty, geography, risk type, industry and credit quality is carried out quarterly and reported to the Board semi-annually. Policies are in place to regulate large exposures to single counterparties or groups of counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has a country risk management framework which covers the assessment of country risk and the approval of country risk limits. Where appropriate the country risk may be mitigated or transferred by parent company guarantees, bank letters of credit, or political risk insurance.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The geographical location is determined by the country of risk. Counterparty type is based on Standard Economic Sector Classifications of Australia (SESCA) as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity investments, commodities, bank notes and coins are excluded from the table below.\n\n|                                                                | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | Governments                                                                      | Financial  institutions 10                                                       | Other                                                                            | Total                                                                            | Governments                                                                                    | institutions 10                                                                                | Other                                                                                          | Total                                                                                          |\n|                                                                | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                                             | $m                                                                                             | $m                                                                                             | $m                                                                                             |\n|                                                                |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |                                                                                                | CONSOLIDATED 2023                                                                              |\n| Australia                                                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |\n| Cash and bank balances                                         | -

The geographical location is determined by the country of risk. Counterparty type is based on Standard Economic Sector Classifications of Australia (SESCA) as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity investments, commodities, bank notes and coins are excluded from the table below.\n\n|                                      | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   | GROSS EXPOSURE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT REQUIREMENT OF AASB9 Financial   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | Financial  institutions 14                                                       | Other                                                                            | Total                                                                            | institutions 14                                                                                | Other                                                                                          | Total                                                                                          |\n|                                      | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                               | $m                                                                                             | $m                                                                                             | $m                                                                                             |\n| Australia                            |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |\n| Financial investments                | 1,335                                                                            | 40                                                                               | 1,375                                                                            | -

For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk is a function of the contractual notional amount, except for certain usage-based guarantees in which case the maximum exposure is determined with respect to the fair value of the underlying exposure and is disclosed in Note 13 Expected credit losses .\n\nCollateral and credit enhancements held\n\n## Cash collateralised lending and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe Consolidated Entity enters into securities and commodities borrowing and reverse repurchase transactions with counterparties which require lodgement of collateral. These arrangements include:\n\n- \u00b7 securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash, for which the fair value of the securities and commodities borrowed is equal to or less than the cash deposited with the counterparty\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase agreements (collateralised financing arrangements), for which the fair value of the securities and commodities received as collateral is generally in excess of the principal amount\n- \u00b7 securities received as collateral in return for the transfer of other securities; and\n- \u00b7 securities borrowed on an unsecured basis in return for a fee.\n\nThe non-cash collateral received is not recognised by the Consolidated Entity in the Statements of financial position, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the counterparty. The Consolidated Entity is permitted to sell or repledge the securities and commodities received. In the absence of default by the counterparty, the Consolidated Entity has an obligation to return the non-cash collateral received to the counterparty.\n\nFor securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash and reverse repurchase arrangements, the fair value of non-cash collateral received is $60,082 million (2023: $55,834 million). For securities borrowed in return for other securities, the fair value of the securities received is $19,012 million (2023: $11,807million). For securities borrowed on an unsecured basis, the fair value of the securities received is $7,530 million (2023: $7,899 million).\n\nOut of the above, the fair value of securities repledged is $22,320 million (2023: $20,933 million).\n\nThe fair value attributed to non-cash collateral held is judgmental and measured with reference to quoted prices in active markets where available (for example, listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair value are estimated using pricing models or other recognised valuation techniques that maximise the use of quoted prices and observable market inputs. The fair value of these securities and commodities were determined when last assessed and have been determined periodically.",

Macquarie has diversified its risk protection coverage to a global panel of reinsurers with diverse lines of business coverage and ratings ranging from AA+ to A- from external rating agencies. The length of risk protection cover is up to 10 years from the year of origination with the type of cover including excess of loss and quota share.\n\nThe following table provides information on the loan to collateral value ratio as determined using loan carrying values and the most recent valuation of the home loan collateral.\n\n|                       | 2024         | 2024    | 2024     | 2023         | 2023    | 2023         |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|\n|                       | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m     |\n|                       |              |         |          |              |         | CONSOLIDATED |\n| <=25%                 | 4,171        | 5       | 4,176    | 3,623        | 5       | 3,628        |\n| >25% to 50%           | 25,719       | 30      | 25,749   | 23,146       | 34      | 23,180       |\n| >50% to 70%           | 48,572       | 96      | 48,668   | 45,395       | 130     | 45,525       |\n| >70% to 80%           | 38,834       | 73      | 38,907   | 33,775       | 78      | 33,853       |\n| >80% to 90%           | 2,950        | 24      | 2,974    | 2,819        | 18      | 2,837        |\n| >90% to 100%          | 280          | 7       | 287      | 375          | 2       | 377          |\n| Partly collateralised | 20           | 3       | 23       | 14           | 3       | 17           |\n| Total home loans      | 120,546      | 238     | 120,784  | 109,147      | 270     | 109,417      |\n\n## Corporate, commercial and other lending\n\nCollateral held against corporate, commercial and other lending consists of secured positions over assets of the counterparty, often in the form of corporate assets. Of the term lending of $47,645 million (2023: $39,835 million), the credit exposure after considering the estimated value of collateral and credit enhancements is $7,123 million (2023: $6,129 million).\n\n## Asset financing\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases assets and provides asset-related financing to corporate and retail clients. Titles to the underlying assets are held by the Consolidated Entity as collateral. Of the asset finance portfolio of $7,942 million (2023: $9,320 million), the credit exposure after considering the depreciated value of collateral is $2,820 million (2023: $3,661 million).\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are referred to as Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives. The Consolidated Entity's and the Company's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled either through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), or bilateral contracts between two counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's approach to financial risk management includes entering into margining and collateralisation arrangements and enforceable master netting arrangements (MNA) with counterparties. The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity receives both cash and non-cash collateral in relation to margining arrangements. Refer to Note 39 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities for impact of master netting arrangements, cash margins and other financial collateral held against the positions as at balance date.\n\nRefer Note 40 Pledged assets and transfers of financial assets for non-cash collateral received and repledged as part of derivative margining arrangements.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

These assets are secured with the underlying securities, commodities or cash held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement. The period between trade and settlement date varies as per regional regulatory and business norms.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nCommodity related receivables under other financial assets are typically either collateralised with the underlying commodity held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement or short-term receivables with standard credit terms which would be backed by a bank guarantee where required to remain within credit limits.\n\n## Credit commitments\n\nUndrawn facilities and lending securities commitments of $33,333 million (2023: $28,760 million) are secured through collateral and credit enhancement. The remaining credit exposure after considering the estimated value of collateral is $9,931 million (2023: $5,877 million).\n\n## Additional collateral\n\nApart from collateral details disclosed above, the Consolidated Entity also holds other types of collateral, such as unsupported guarantees. While such mitigants have value as a credit risk mitigant often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable values are uncertain and therefore are assigned no value for disclosure purposes.\n\nFor all collateral, in the event of default realised collateral values may be lower than the value of collateral as at the reporting date.\n\n## Repossessed collateral\n\nIn the event of a customer default, the Consolidated Entity may either take possession of the underlying collateral held as security and/or exercise its right to dispose of the customer's asset. At the reporting date, the Consolidated Entity did not have any material amounts of such collateral recognised in its Statements of financial position.\n\n## Note 36.2 Liquidity risk\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nMacquarie's liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations as they fall due under a range of market conditions.\n\nLiquidity management is performed centrally by Group Treasury, with oversight from the MGL and MBL Asset and Liability Committees (ALCO), the MGL and MBL Boards and RMG. Macquarie's liquidity policies are approved by the MGL and MBL Boards after endorsement by the respective ALCO and liquidity reporting is provided to the Boards on a regular basis. The MGL and MBL ALCOs include the MGL CEO, MBL CEO, CFO, CRO, COO, Group General Counsel, Co-Heads of Group Treasury and relevant Operating Group Heads.\n\nRMG provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management, including ownership of liquidity policies and key limits and approval of material liquidity scenario assumptions.\n\n## Liquidity policy and risk appetite\n\nThe MGL and MBL liquidity policies are designed so that each of Macquarie, the Bank Group and the Non-Bank Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations as they fall due. The MBL Liquidity Policy outlines the standalone framework for the Bank Group and its principles are consistent with the MGL Liquidity Policy . Macquarie's liquidity risk appetite is intended to ensure that Macquarie is able to meet all of its liquidity obligations during a period of liquidity stress: a twelve month period with constrained access to funding markets for MBL, no access to funding markets for MGL and with only a limited reduction in Macquarie's franchise businesses.\n\nReflecting the longer-term nature of the Non-Bank Group asset profile, MGL is funded predominantly with a mixture of capital and long-term wholesale funding. MBL is an authorised deposit-taking institution and is funded mainly with deposits, long-term liabilities and capital.\n\n## Liquidity contingency plan\n\nGroup Treasury maintains a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MGL and a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MBL, which outline how a liquidity crisis would be managed for the Group and Bank, respectively. The plans define roles and responsibilities and actions to be taken in a liquidity event, including identifying key information requirements and appropriate communication plans with both internal and external parties.",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management continued\n\n## Note 36.2 Liquidity risk continued\n\nSpecifically, the plans detail:\n\n- \u00b7 factors that may constitute a crisis\n- \u00b7 the officers responsible for invoking each plan\n- \u00b7 a committee of senior executives responsible for managing a crisis\n- \u00b7 the information required to effectively manage a crisis\n- \u00b7 a communications strategy\n- \u00b7 a high level checklist of possible actions to conserve or raise additional liquidity for the Group or Bank; and\n- \u00b7 contact lists to facilitate prompt communication with all key internal and external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Macquarie monitors a range of early warning indicators on a daily basis that might assist in identifying emerging risks in Macquarie's liquidity position. These indicators are reviewed by Senior Management and are used to inform any decisions regarding invoking the plan.\n\nThe Liquidity Contingency Plans are subject to regular review by both Group Treasury and RMG. They are submitted annually to the MGL and MBL ALCO and respective Boards for approval.\n\nMacquarie is a global financial institution, with branches and subsidiaries in a variety of countries. Regulations in certain countries may require some branches or subsidiaries to have specific local contingency plans. Where that is the case, the Liquidity Contingency Plans contain either a supplement or a reference to a separate document providing the specific information required for those branches or subsidiaries.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nMacquarie prepares a Funding Strategy for MGL and a Funding Strategy for MBL on an annual basis and monitors progress against the strategies throughout the year.\n\nThe Funding Strategies aim to maintain diversity of funding sources for MGL and MBL, ensure ongoing compliance with all liquidity requirements and facilitate forecast asset growth.\n\nThe Funding Strategies are reviewed by the MGL and MBL ALCO and approved by the respective Boards.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis is central to Macquarie's liquidity risk management framework. In addition to regulatory defined scenarios, Group Treasury models additional liquidity scenarios covering both market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crises.\n\nThese scenarios use a range of assumptions, which Macquarie intends to be conservative, regarding the level of access to capital markets, deposit outflows, contingent funding requirements and asset sales.\n\nAs an example, one internal scenario projects the expected cash and liquid asset position during a combined market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crisis over a twelve month time frame. This scenario assumes no access to wholesale funding markets, a significant loss of customer deposits and contingent funding outflows resulting from undrawn commitments, market moves impacting derivatives and other margined positions combined with a multiple notch credit rating downgrade. Macquarie's cash and liquid asset portfolio must exceed the minimum requirement as calculated in this scenario at all times.\n\n## Liquid asset holdings\n\nGroup Treasury centrally maintains a portfolio of highly liquid unencumbered assets which are intended to ensure adequate liquidity is available under a range of market conditions. The minimum level of cash and liquid assets is calculated with reference to internal scenario analysis and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe cash and liquid asset portfolio contains only unencumbered assets that can be relied on to maintain their liquidity in a crisis scenario. Specifically, cash and liquid assets held to meet minimum internal and regulatory requirements must be cash balances (including central bank reserves and overnight lending to financial institutions), qualifying High-Quality Liquid Assets and other Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repo eligible securities. Composition constraints are also applied to ensure appropriate diversity and quality of the assets in the portfolio. The cash and liquid asset portfolio is held in a range of currencies consistent with the distribution of liquidity needs by currency, allowing for an acceptable level of currency mismatches.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nAn internal funds transfer pricing framework is in place that has been designed to produce appropriate incentives for business decision-making by reflecting the funding costs arising from business actions and the separate funding tasks and liquidity requirements of the Bank and Non-Bank Groups. Under this framework, each business is allocated the appropriate cost of the funding required to support its products and business lines, recognising the actual and contingent funding-related exposures their activities create. The Operating Groups are assumed to be fully debt funded for the purposes of internal funding charges.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Repayments subject to notice are treated as if notice were given immediately. This does not reflect the behaviour of the expected cash flows as indicated by the Consolidated Entity's deposit retention history since the Consolidated Entity expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Consolidated Entity could be required to pay.\n\n|                                                              | Statement of  financial position $m   | 0 to 3 months $m   | 3 to 12 months $m   | 1 to 5 years $m   | Over 5 years $m   | Total $m          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                              |                                       |                    |                     |                   | CONSOLIDATED 2024 | CONSOLIDATED 2024 |\n| Cash collateralised borrowing and  repurchase agreements 1   | 12,599                                | 12,655             | 13                  | 5                 | -                 | 12,673            |\n| Trading liabilities 2                                        | 5,044                                 | 5,053              | -                   | -                 | -                 | 5,053             |\n| Margin money and settlement  liabilities                     | 28,423                                | 28,461             | -                   | -                 | -                 | 28,461            |\n| Derivative liabilities (trading) 2                           | 21,808                                | 21,811             | -                   | -                 | -                 | 21,811            |\n| Derivative liabilities (Hedge  Accounting Relationships) 3   | 3,777                                 |                    |                     |                   |                   |                   |\n| Contractual amounts payable                                  |                                       | 946                | 2,761               | 4,067             | 1,799             | 9,573             |\n| Contractual amounts receivable                               |                                       | (459)              | (1,625)             | (1,774)           | (1,229)           | (5,087)           |\n| Deposits                                                     | 148,416                               | 138,855            | 9,370               | 555               | 12                | 148,792           |\n| Held for sale and other liabilities                          | 6,994                                 | 3,180              | 2,415               | 1,207             | 497               | 7,299             |\n| Issued debt securities and other  borrowings 4               | 119,878                               | 11,507             | 36,148              | 59,910            | 27,137            | 134,702           |\n| Loan capital 5                                               | 14,201                                | 190                | 1,681               | 10,902            | 5,568             | 18,341            |\n| Total                                                        | 361,140                               | 222,199            | 50,763              | 74,872            | 33,784            | 381,618           |\n| Total undiscounted contingent  liabilities and commitments 6 | -                                     | 16,483             | 1,047               | 4,070             | 14,789            | 36,389            |",

Any position not deemed to be trading book is considered to be ' banking book ', and covered by either the non-traded market risk or equity risk frameworks.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse changes in the value of the Consolidated Entity's trading positions as a result of changes in market conditions. The Consolidated Entity is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 price : The risk of loss due to changes in price of a risk factor (interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities etc.)\n- \u00b7 volatility : The risk of loss due to changes in the volatility of a risk factor\n- \u00b7 basis : The risk of imperfect correlation between offsetting investments in a hedging strategy\n- \u00b7 correlation : The risk that the actual correlation between two assets or variables is different from the assumed correlation\n- \u00b7 illiquid market : The risk of inability to sell assets or close out positions in thinly-traded markets at close to the last market prices\n- \u00b7 concentration : The risk of over concentration of trading exposures in certain markets and products\n- \u00b7 valuation adjustments : The risk of actual valuation adjustments to derivative positions; specifically Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).\n\nIt is recognised that all trading activities contain calculated elements of risk taking. The Consolidated Entity is prepared to accept such risks provided they are within agreed limits, independently and correctly identified, calculated and monitored by RMG, and reported to Senior Management on a regular basis.\n\nRMG monitors positions within the Consolidated Entity according to a limit structure which sets limits for all exposures in all markets. Limits are for both individual trading desks and divisions as well as in aggregate.\n\nRMG sets three complementary limit structures:\n\n- \u00b7 contingent loss limits : Worst-case scenarios that shock prices and volatilities by more than that which has occurred historically. Multiple scenarios are set for each market to capture the non-linearity and complexity of exposures arising from derivatives. A wide range of assumptions about the correlation between markets is applied\n- \u00b7 position limits : Volume, maturity and open position limits are set on a large number of market instruments and securities in order to constrain concentration risk and to avoid the accumulation of risky, illiquid positions\n- \u00b7 Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits : A statistical measure based on a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level, as stipulated by the APRA capital adequacy standard. The model is validated daily by back testing a one-day VaR against hypothetical and actual daily trading profit or loss.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The following factors can limit the effectiveness of VaR in predicting future price moves:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of historical data means that the current model parameters may not reflect future market conditions especially when entering a period of heightened volatility. The model utilises exponential weighting to place emphasis on the most recent market movements to more accurately reflect current conditions\n- \u00b7 VaR is calculated at the 99% level of confidence and does not account for losses that could occur beyond this point.\n\nFor capital adequacy purposes, debt-specific risk is measured using APRA's standard method, whilst all other exposures are captured by the VaR model. This combined approach has been approved by APRA.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has exposure to non-traded market risks arising from transactions entered into during its normal course of business and as a result of its investments in foreign operations. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 interest rate: changes in the level, shape and volatility of yield curves, and/or client behaviour given these changes\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange: changes in the spot exchange rates.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for non-traded market risks. Where commercially feasible, these risks are transferred into the trading books of CGM and Group Treasury and governed within the traded market risk framework described above. Responsibility for managing exposures rests with individual businesses, with independent monitoring performed by RMG and FMG.\n\n## Accounting considerations arising from hedging activities\n\nThe use of derivative and other financial instruments to hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to income statement volatility due to difference in accounting treatments. The Consolidated entity manages this volatility through hedge accounting and use of naturally offsetting positions in the income statement as set out in Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities and Note 35 Hedge accounting .",

Aggregate IRRBB exposures for the Consolidated Entity are constrained on both measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS ): the EVS metric measures the change in net present value of the interest-bearing portfolios in the banking book as a result of changes in interest rates.\n- \u00b7 Earnings at Risk (EaR) : the EaR model constrains the impact on reported net income over 12 months for a change in interest rates.\n\nA central objective of the Consolidated Entity's Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to reduce earnings volatility to interest rate movements. A key component of this arises where shareholders' equity invested in interest bearing assets are managed by holding a portfolio of 'receive fixed' interest rate swaps. The duration of this hedging program is constrained by Board-approved limits, and subject to independent oversight by RMG.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is active in various currencies globally. A key objective of the Consolidated Entity's Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to reduce this sensitivity of regulatory capital ratios to foreign currency movements.\n\nThis is achieved by leaving specific investments in foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements and captured in the foreign currency translation reserve, a component of regulatory capital, which aligns the foreign exchange sensitivity of capital supply with that of foreign currency capital requirements.\n\nThe table below presents the sensitivity of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations to the most material currencies. As a result of the policy described above, these movements will not have a material impact on the capital ratios.\n\n|                      | 2024                          | 2024                                                     | 2023                          | 2023                                                     |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | Movement in exchange  rates % | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive income  after tax $m | Movement in exchange  rates % | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive income  after tax $m |\n| United States dollar | +10                           | (1,312)                                                  | +10                           | (1,254)                                                  |\n| Pound sterling       | +10                           | (220)                                                    | +10                           | (201)                                                    |\n| Euro                 | +10                           | (145)                                                    | +10                           | (111)                                                    |\n| Total                |                               | (1,677)                                                  |                               | (1,566)                                                  |\n| United States dollar | -10                           | 1,312                                                    | -10                           | 1,254                                                    |\n| Pound sterling       | -10                           | 220                                                      | -10                           | 201                                                      |\n| Euro                 | -10                           | 145                                                      | -10                           | 111                                                      |\n| Total                |                               | 1,677                                                    |                               | 1,566                                                    |\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

This included the transition of the Consolidated Entity's exposures in GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF and USD LIBOR, as well as IBOR for other minor currencies.\n\nThe remaining transition focus is on the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) which will cease publication on 28 June 2024. The Consolidated Entity has actively begun to engage with clients to support them through the transition from CDOR to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).\n\nThe Consolidated Entity also continues to have exposures to the 28-day term Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE). The transition risk for these contracts is low, given that the TIIE will be calculated synthetically from 1 January 2025 and amendments to existing contracts are not required.\n\nWhilst the transition of contracts referencing CDOR and other minor IBORs continues to expose the Consolidated Entity to inherent risks, the remaining IBOR transition efforts and risk has significantly reduced. The operating groups manage remaining IBOR transition risks within the Consolidated Entity's existing risk management framework.\n\nExposure yet to be transitioned to ARRs: The notional value of the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments which are yet to transition to ARRs as at the reporting date includes:\n\n- \u00b7 derivatives : gross exposure of $19,342 million in MXN TIIE, $3,942 million in CDOR and $884 million in other currencies (2023: $79,673 million in USD LIBOR, $14,886 million in MXN TIIE, $3,573 million in CDOR and $618 million in other currencies)\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial assets : exposure of $470 million in CDOR and $103 million in other currencies (2023: $5,231 million in USD LIBOR, $704 million in CDOR and $152 million in other currencies).\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial liabilities : $nil exposure (2023: $3,637 million in USD LIBOR).\n\nThe scope of the above-mentioned exposures has been determined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the benchmark will be replaced, and the replacement date is known. Only exposures with contractual maturities extending beyond the replacement date have been included\n- \u00b7 the gross notional values for derivatives and both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures have been included\n- \u00b7 for contracts that reference more than one benchmark, such as a cross currency swap, the exposure includes both benchmarks to reflect the absolute exposure to different reference rates\n- \u00b7 derivative contracts of $nil (2023: $9,664 million) designated in hedge accounting relationships have synthetically transitioned and have been excluded, primarily relating to the USD LIBOR to SOFR transition.",

If the market for a financial and non-financial instrument is not active, fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques, using inputs based on market conditions prevailing at the measurement date.\n\nThe values derived from applying these techniques are affected by the choice of valuation model used and the underlying assumptions made regarding such inputs.\n\nItems measured at fair value are categorised in their entirety, in accordance with the levels of the fair value hierarchy as outlined below.\n\n| Level 1:   | unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                                                                                                     |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level 2:   | inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  (i.e. derived from prices). |\n| Level 3:   | inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).                                                                               |\n\nThe appropriate fair value hierarchy level for an item is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nAASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation systems will typically generate mid-market prices. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all of the residual net exposure to market risks were closed, on a portfolio basis, using available hedging instruments.\n\nThe following methods and significant assumptions have been applied in determining the fair values of the following items carried at amortised cost in the Statements

Where exposures are managed on a portfolio basis, the adjustment is calculated on a counterparty basis for those exposures. For financial liabilities carried at fair value, in order to measure the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk, an adjustment is incorporated into the valuations.\n\nWhere valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. The output of a valuation technique is always an estimate of a fair value that cannot be measured with complete certainty. Models are reviewed and calibrated periodically to test the outputs and reflect the prices from observable current market transactions in same instrument or other available observable market data.\n\nTo the extent possible, models use only observable market data, however management is required to make assumptions for certain inputs that are not supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument such as volatility and correlation.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Transfers out of Level 3 were principally due to valuation inputs becoming observable during the financial year. Financial assets reclassified into/out of the fair value hierarchy disclosure due to recognition and measurement category changes, or where there have been changes in significant influence or control but some form of interest in the assets are still retained, are also presented as transfers into/out of Level 3.\n\n## Unrecognised gains or losses\n\nThe best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only data from observable markets (or when inputs from unobservable markets are insignificant). Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the asset or liability is recognised ('day 1 profit or loss'). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nThe table below summarises the deferral and recognition of profit or loss where a valuation technique has been applied in which significant unobservable inputs are used.\n\n|                                                         | CONSOLIDATED   | CONSOLIDATED   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                         | 2024 $m        | 2023 $m        |\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year          | 272            | 76             |\n| Deferred gain on new transactions and other adjustments | 190            | 231            |\n| Foreign exchange movements                              | (2)            | 23             |\n| Recognised in net trading income during the year        | (172)          | (58)           |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year                | 288            | 272            |\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Significant unobservable inputs may include interest rates and credit spreads of counterparties and original issue discounts on primary debt issuances. Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality which increase the discount factor applied to future cash flows thereby reducing the value of the asset. Credit spreads may be implied from the market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.\n\nPrice in % : Comparable transactions are leveraged to price the fair value of the assets and liabilities and a percentage is applied to ascertain the proportion of the transaction price that is comparable with the specific asset/liability. This price percentage is an unobservable input and judgemental depending on the characteristics of the asset/liability.",

Judgement is involved in the calculation of these margin curves depending on the quality of the commodity or delivery location and other economic conditions.\n\nCorrelation : Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of input variables (i.e. how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable). It is expressed as a percentage between -100% and +100%, where 100% represents perfectly correlated variables and -100% represents inversely correlated variables. Correlation is a key input into the valuation of derivatives with more than one underlying (e.g. interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchanges rates, inflation rates or equity prices) and is generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments.\n\nVolatility : Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given underlying input and is generally expressed as a percentage, which represents an estimate of the amount a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Volatility is an input in the valuation of derivatives containing optionality. Volatility is impacted by the underlying risk, term and strike price of a derivative.\n\nCorrelations and volatilities are derived through the extrapolation of observable volatilities, recent transaction prices, quotes from other market participants and historical data adjusted for current conditions.\n\n## Equity and equity-linked products\n\nUnlisted equity securities are generally valued based on earnings or revenue multiples, referencing market transactions which are not directly comparable or quantifiable and are adjusted as appropriate for current economic conditions. Other significant unobservable inputs may include NAV and discount rates determined using inputs specific to the underlying investment and forecast cash flows and earnings/revenues of investee entities.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity to reasonably possible alternative assumptions for Level 3 instruments whose fair values are determined in whole, or in part, using unobservable inputs. The impact of the sensitivity of instruments which hedge the Level 3 positions but are classified as Level 1 or 2 is not included in the table below.\n\n|                                   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | Profit or loss $m    | OCI $m               | Profit or loss $m      | OCI $m                 |\n|                                   |                      |                      |                        | CONSOLIDATED 2024      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 214                  | -                    | (181)                  | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 153                  | 18                   | (172)                  | (23)                   |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 174                  | -                    | (121)                  | -                      |\n| Total                             | 541                  | 18                   | (474)                  | (23)                   |\n|                                   |                      |                      |                        | CONSOLIDATED 2023      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 115                  | -                    | (104)                  | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 122                  | 11                   | (114)                  | -                      |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 126                  | 1                    | (93)                   | -                      |\n| Total                             | 363                  | 12                   | (311)                  | -                      |\n\nThe favourable and unfavourable changes from using reasonable possible alternative assumptions for the valuation of above product types have been calculated by recalibrating the valuation model using stressed significant unobservable inputs of the Consolidated Entity's range of reasonably possible estimates.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The following tables provide information on the impact of offsetting of financial instruments in the Statements of financial position, as well as amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements that do not meet all the criteria for offsetting and therefore presented gross in the Statements of financial position. Enforceable netting arrangements may allow for net settlement of specified contracts with a counterparty only in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's and the Company's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses a variety of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements, therefore amounts presented in this note are not intended to represent the credit risk exposure of the entity. Refer to Note 36.1 Credit risk for information on credit risk management.\n\n|                                                                | EFFECT OF OFFSETTING ON THE STATEMENT OF  FINANCIAL POSITION   | EFFECT OF OFFSETTING ON THE STATEMENT OF  FINANCIAL POSITION   | RELATED AMOUNTS  SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE  NETTING ARRANGEMENTS      | RELATED AMOUNTS  SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE  NETTING ARRANGEMENTS   | 1                                         |                                                                                        |                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                | Gross amount 2 $m                                              | Amounts  offset on the   Statements of  financial  position $m | Net amounts  reported on the  Statements of  financial position $m | Other  recognised  financial  instruments $m                    | Cash and  other  financial  collateral $m | Other collateral for  exposures not  subject to  enforceable netting  arrangements  $m | Net exposure $m   |\n|                                                                |                                                                |                                                                |                                                                    |                                                                 |                                           |                                                                                        | CONSOLIDATED 2024 |\n| Cash collateralised lending and reverse  repurchase agreements | 58,728                                                         | (312)                                                          | 58,416                                                             | (16)                                                            | (54,405)                                  | (3,947)                                                                                | 48                |\n| Settlement assets 3                                            | 17,157                                                         | (6,188)                                                        | 10,969                                                             | (2,782)                                                         | -

Depending on the criteria discussed in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments , the Consolidated Entity may be unable to derecognise the transferred asset, be able to derecognise the transferred assets in full or continue to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are derecognised\n\nWhen financial assets are derecognised, some continuing involvement may be retained in the assets in the form of liquidity support, financial guarantees, certain derivatives or retention of part of securitisation interests. For the financial years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023, there were no material transfers of financial assets where the Consolidated Entity has had continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised\n\nThe Consolidated Entity did not derecognise any financial assets to the extent of continuing involvement in the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023. The following transactions typically result in the transferred assets continuing to be recognised in full.\n\n## Repurchase and securities lending agreements\n\nSecurities and commodities sold under an agreement to repurchase and securities subject to lending agreements continue to be recognised in the Statements of financial position and an associated liability is recognised for the consideration received.\n\nWhere securities are transferred in return for the loan of other securities or on an unsecured basis in return for a fee, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full. There is no associated liability as the securities received are not recognised on the balance sheet. The Consolidated Entity is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these assets.\n\nIn certain arrangements the transferee cannot otherwise sell or pledge the transferred securities, however, the assets may be substituted if the required collateral is maintained.\n\n## Other financial transfers not derecognised\n\nIncludes loans and leases sold or lent to an external funder where the Consolidated Entity retains full economic exposure. In such instances, the Consolidated Entity has a right to receive cash from the lessee and an obligation to pay those cash flows to the external funder.\n\nAlso, includes trading assets and financial investments that have been transferred as margin against future trades. The Consolidated Entity is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of open position and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these assets.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

        "page_content": "## Note 44\n\n## Material accounting policies\n\n## (i) Principles of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated Financial Report reflects the financial performance and financial position of the Consolidated Entity. Subsidiaries are all those entities (including structured entities) which the Consolidated Entity controls. The Consolidated Entity controls an entity where it has:\n\n- \u00b7 power to direct the relevant activities\n- \u00b7 exposure, or rights, to variable returns, and\n- \u00b7 the ability to utilise power to affect the entity's returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. The Consolidated Entity has power over an entity when it has existing substantive rights that provide it with the current ability to direct the entity's relevant activities, being those activities that significantly affect the entity's returns. The Consolidated Entity also considers the entity's purpose and design. If the Consolidated Entity determines that it has power over an entity, the Consolidated Entity then evaluates its exposure, or rights, to variable returns by considering the magnitude and variability associated with its economic interests.\n\nAll variable returns are considered in making that assessment including, but not limited to, returns from debt or equity investments, guarantees, liquidity arrangements, variable fees and certain derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Consolidated Entity has determined that it controls entities that it has less than half of the voting rights on the basis of its ability to direct the relevant activities of those entities.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nStructured Entities (SEs) are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities of the SE are directed by means of contractual arrangements. When assessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls (and therefore consolidates) a SE, judgement is required as to whether the Consolidated Entity has power over the relevant activities as well as exposure, or rights, to variable returns of the SE.\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity has power over the SE's relevant activities, has assessed that its exposure to variable returns (including through the residual risk associated with its involvement in SEs) is sufficient, and is able to affect its returns, the SE is consolidated. Refer to Note 34 Structured entities for further information related to both consolidated and unconsolidated SE's.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe effects of all transactions between subsidiaries in the Consolidated Entity are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated Income statements, consolidated Statements of comprehensive income, consolidated Statements of changes in equity and consolidated Statements of financial position and are determined on the basis of the Consolidated Entity's present ownership interest in the entity.\n\nWhere control of an entity was obtained during the financial year, its results are included in the consolidated Income statements from the date on which control was obtained. Where control of an entity ceased during the financial year, its results are included for that part of the financial year during which control existed.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining control (i.e. acquisition date) and losing control (i.e. disposal date) of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to direct the relevant activities and the extent of the Consolidated Entity's exposure to the entity's variable returns. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\n\nSubsidiaries held by the Company are carried in its financial statements at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\n## Interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are entities over which the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control. Existing ownership interests (including in substance ownership interests) in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. In-substance ownership interests are interests that are substantially similar to an investee's ordinary shares. Equity accounting of the ownership interests is applied from the date that the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control and ceases when the Consolidated Entity no longer has significant influence or joint control.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining or losing significant influence or joint control of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to significantly influence the financial and operating policies or jointly control the relevant activities of that entity. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice, and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Dividends received by the Consolidated Entity from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. Transactions reported directly in equity (besides those reflected in other comprehensive income) are accounted for by the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the substance of the transaction and whether the transaction is dilutive to the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest. Where the transaction is dilutive, the impact is recorded as part of the Consolidated Entity's share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\nEquity accounting of losses is restricted to the Consolidated Entity's interests in its associate or joint venture, unless the Consolidated Entity has an obligation or has made payment on behalf of the entity.\n\nLong-term interests in an associate or joint venture, to which the equity method is not applied but in-substance form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, are accounted for in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' accounting policies, which includes accounting for expected credit losses, where applicable. Subsequently, the loss allocation and impairment requirements in AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are applied to long-term interests.\n\nWhere necessary, accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed to ensure consistency with those adopted by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, management reviews the Consolidated Entity's investments in associates and joint ventures for indicators of impairment. Where there is an indicator of impairment, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying value. Impairment losses and reversals are recognised in other impairment charges/reversals. A reversal of a previously recognised impairment loss is recognised only to the extent that the investment's carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (including consideration of any equity accounted losses) if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale when the Consolidated Entity determines that the interest will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Equity accounting is suspended when the interest is classified as held for sale.\n\nOn disposal of an investment in an associate or a joint venture, the difference between the sales consideration, any retained interest and the carrying value is recognised as a gain or loss in investment income as part of other operating income and charges together with any gains and losses in OCI that is related to the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Changes in ownership interests\n\n## When acquiring additional interests:\n\n- \u00b7 of a financial asset (such that it becomes an associate, joint venture or subsidiary), or\n- \u00b7 in an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a subsidiary), where the underlying entity constitutes a business,\n\npreviously held interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part other operating income and charges.\n\nSimilarly, when selling ownership interests of a subsidiary, where the underlying constitutes a business (such that control is lost), or an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a financial asset), retained ownership interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges. Retained ownership interests are not revalued where the sale represents a contribution to an associate or joint venture, nor in certain circumstances where the partial sale of an investment in associate or joint venture, which continues to be equity accounted post the sale, is affected through a holding company subsidiary.\n\nIncreases and decreases in the Consolidated Entity's interest in a subsidiary (that do not result in the loss of control) are accounted for directly within equity. Increases in the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest in an associate or joint venture are accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of the interest in associate or joint venture. The difference between the reduction in the Consolidated Entity's interest in an associate or joint venture that remains an associate or joint venture and the fair value of consideration received is accounted for as a gain or loss within investment income as part of other operating income and charges. A proportionate amount of associated OCI is reclassified to profit or loss, or reclassified within equity, as would otherwise be required on disposal of the underlying position.\n\n## (ii) Business combinations\n\nDistinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired involves judgement. The Consolidated Entity identifies a business where an acquired integrated set of activities and assets includes an economic resource (input) and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income or other income from ordinary activities (outputs).\n\nOn a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Consolidated Entity may use a practical expedient to determine that an acquired set of activities is not a business. Under this assessment, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.",

The consideration exchanged is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred. Transaction costs of a business combination are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement as part of other operating expenses.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. The Consolidated Entity elects, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to initially measure NCI either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration exchanged, recognised NCI, and the fair value of previously held equity interests over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired and is recognised as part of Intangible assets in the Statements of financial position. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\nIf the consideration is less than the Consolidated Entity's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\nContingent consideration that is dependent on any subsequent event is measured at fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present values as at the acquisition date. The discount rate used is the Consolidated Entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (including branches) in the Consolidated Entity is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Consolidated Entity and the Company's financial statements are presented in Australian dollars (the presentation currency), which is also the Company's functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nAt initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction is translated into the entity's functional currency using the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period:\n\n- \u00b7 foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items (including equity) measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency remain translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction, and\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date that the fair value was measured.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement or translation of monetary items, or non-monetary items measured at fair value, are recognised in net trading income with one exception being where such monetary items are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedge or net investment hedge relationships. In such circumstances, the foreign exchange gains and losses may be deferred in OCI to the extent the hedge is effective (refer to Note 35 Hedge accounting and Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities ).\n\n## Subsidiaries and other entities\n\nThe results and financial position of all entities that have a functional currency other than Australian dollars are translated into Australian dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities for each Statements of financial position presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the date of that Statements of financial position. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 income and expenses for each income statement are translated at actual or average exchange rates at the dates of the transactions\n- \u00b7 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI within a separate component of reserves, being the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).\n\nForeign currency gains and losses on intragroup loans are recognised in the income statement except where the loan is in substance part of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in the foreign operation, in which case the foreign currency gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Entity's FCTR.\n\nThe exchange gains or losses recognised in FCTR are reclassified to the income statement or reattributed within equity as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 if there is a disposal of a foreign operation, then the accumulated FCTR is reclassified from OCI to investment income within other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is an associate or joint arrangement, without loss of significant influence or joint control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reclassified to investment income\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary, without loss of control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reattributed within equity to noncontrolling interests.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The EIR method calculates the amortised cost of a financial instrument at a rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Fees and transaction costs that are integral to the lending arrangement are recognised in interest income or interest expense, as applicable, over the expected life (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) of the instrument in accordance with the EIR method.\n\nWhen the estimates of payments or receipts of a financial instrument are subsequently revised, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the actual or revised cash flows with the remeasurement recognised as part of interest income (financial assets) or interest expense (financial liabilities).\n\nThe calculation of the EIR does not include ECL, except for financial assets which on initial recognition are classified as purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI). Interest income on these assets is determined using a credit adjusted EIR by discounting the estimated future cash receipts, including credit losses expected at initial recognition, through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nInterest income on financial assets that are subsequently classified as credit-impaired (Stage III), is recognised by applying the EIR to the amortised cost carrying value (being the gross carrying value after deducting the impairment loss). Interest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities that are classified as FVTPL is accounted for on a contractual rate basis and included in Other Interest Income.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nRevenue earned by the Consolidated Entity from its contracts with customers primarily consists of the following categories of fee and commission income:\n\n## Base and other asset management fees, and performance fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns base and other asset management and performance fees for providing asset management services for listed and unlisted funds, managed accounts and coinvestments arrangements. It has been determined that the provision of asset management services is typically a single performance obligation.\n\nBase management fees are recognised over the life of the contract as the asset management services are provided. Any associated performance fees are deemed to be a variable component of the same asset management service and are recognised only when it is highly probable that the performance hurdles are met, and a significant reversal of cumulative fees recognised to date will not occur. Determining the amount and timing of performance fees to be recognised involves judgement, the use of estimates (including management estimates of underlying asset values) and consideration of a number of criteria relating to both the fund or managed account in which the asset(s) are held, as well as the underlying asset(s), such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the extent to which performance fee liabilities have been accrued by the fund or managed account to date or consideration of the current valuation case of the assets in relation to the related performance fee hurdle rate\n- \u00b7 the proportion of assets realised and returns on those assets\n- \u00b7 nature of remaining underlying fund or managed account's assets and potential downside valuation risks on each\n- \u00b7 time remaining until realisation of the assets and the fund's life or asset management services' timeline\n- \u00b7 consideration of the ability to dispose of the asset, including any barriers to divest.\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions, advisory and underwriting fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns revenue through its role as advisor on corporate transactions as well as through its role as manager and underwriter of equity and debt issuances. The revenue from these arrangements is recognised at a point in time, and when it has been established that the customer has received the benefit of the service such that the performance obligation is satisfied. For advisory services this is typically at the time of closing the transaction.\n\nWhere mandates contain rights to invoice upon reaching certain milestones, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether distinct services have been transferred at these milestones and accordingly recognises revenue. If not, the fee recognition will be deferred until such time as the performance obligation has been completed. Management of capital raisings and underwriting of debt or equity capital raisings are each considered distinct performance obligations that are typically satisfied on the allocation date of the underwritten securities.\n\n## Brokerage and other trading-related fee income\n\nThe Consolidated Entity enters into contracts with customers to act as an agent to buy and sell securities. The brokerage and commission income related to this service is recognised on trade date and is presented net of any rebates.\n\n## Other fee and commission income\n\nOther fee and commission income includes fees earned on a range of banking products and services platforms, wealth services, credit cards, structuring fees, lending services, stock borrow and lending activities and income on structured products which is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

Refer to Note 44(i) Principles of consolidation for details on the timing of recognition of such gains or losses.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends or distributions are recognised when the right to receive a dividend or distribution is established, it is probable the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company and/or Consolidated Entity and the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\nDividends or distributions from HFT assets are recognised in net trading income, as investment income as part of other operating income and charges for other financial assets measured at FVTPL or FVOCI, or as a reduction to the carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position. Where associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale, dividends or distributions are recognised within other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nIn the Company's financial statements, judgement may be applied in determining whether distributions from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are to be recognised as dividend income or as a return of capital. Distributions that represent a return of capital are accounted for by the Company as a reduction to the cost of its investment and are otherwise recognised by the Company within investment income as part of other operating income and charges when the recognition criteria are met.\n\n## Expenses\n\nExpenses are recognised in the income statement as and when the provision of services is received.\n\n## (v) Segment reporting\n\nOperating Segments are identified on the basis of internal reports to Senior Management about components of the Consolidated Entity that are regularly reviewed by Senior Management who have been identified as the chief operating decision makers, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. Information reported to Senior Management for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance is specifically focused on core products and services offered, comprising five reportable segments as disclosed in Note 3 Segment reporting .\n\nInformation about products and services is based on the financial information used to produce the Consolidated Entity's financial statements. Information about geographical segments is based on the jurisdiction of the respective entities.\n\n## (vi) Taxation\n\nThe balance sheet approach to tax effect accounting has been adopted whereby the income tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and unused tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when temporary differences arise between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts which give rise to a future tax benefit, or when a benefit arises due to unused tax losses. In both cases, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available against which to utilise those temporary differences or tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised when such temporary differences give rise to taxable amounts that are payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered, or the liabilities are settled under enacted or substantively enacted tax law.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities that would otherwise arise following the enactment or substantive enactment of Pillar Two legislation are not recognised in the financial statements in accordance with a mandatory exception to the Accounting Standards, as disclosed in Note 1(iv) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and interpretation that are effective in the current financial year .\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and an intention to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised in OCI are also recognised in OCI.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets, particularly in relation to tax losses, are probable of recovery.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

The Consolidated Entity estimates the amount expected to be paid to/(recovered from) tax authorities based on its understanding and interpretation of the law. Uncertain tax positions are presented as current or deferred tax assets or liabilities with reference to the nature of the underlying uncertainty.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Australian tax liabilities are determined according to tax consolidation legislation.\n\nThe Company, together with all eligible Australian resident wholly owned subsidiaries, comprise a tax consolidated group (TCG) with the Company as the head entity. As a consequence, the relevant subsidiaries are not liable to make income tax payments and do not recognise any current tax balances or any deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or credits.\n\nThe TCG recognises its current and deferred taxes using the 'group allocation approach' detailed in AASB UIG Interpretation 1052 Tax Consolidation Accounting . Under the terms and conditions of a tax funding agreement, the Company charges each subsidiary for all current tax liabilities incurred in respect of their activities and reimburses each subsidiary for any tax assets arising from unused tax losses.\n\nShould the Company be in default of its tax payment obligations, or a default is probable, the current tax balances of its subsidiaries will be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of a tax sharing agreement between the Company and entities in the TCG.\n\n## Goods and Services tax (GST)\n\nWhere an amount of GST (or other value added tax) is not recoverable from global tax authorities, it is either capitalised to the Statements of financial position as part of the cost of the related asset or is recognised as part of other operating expenses.\n\nWhere GST (or other value added tax) is recoverable from or payable to global tax authorities, the net amount is recorded as a separate asset or liability in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (vii) Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are recognised when the Consolidated Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value and is adjusted (in the case of instruments not classified at FVTPL) for transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument, and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs and fees paid or received relating to financial instruments carried at FVTPL are recorded in the income statement.\n\nThe best evidence of a financial instrument's fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only inputs from observable markets (or when inputs from unobservable markets are insignificant). Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the instrument is recognised (day 1 profit or loss). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in net trading income over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nFinancial instruments arising in multiple transactions are accounted for as a single arrangement if this best reflects the substance of the arrangement. Factors considered in this assessment include whether the financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 are entered into at the same time and in contemplation of one another\n- \u00b7 have the same counterparty\n- \u00b7 relate to the same risk\n- \u00b7 there is no apparent economic need or substantive business purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been accomplished in a single transaction, or\n- \u00b7 whether each of the financial instruments has its own terms and conditions and may be transferred or settled separately.\n\n## Derecognition of financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised from the Statements of financial position when:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual rights to cash flows have expired, or\n- \u00b7 the Consolidated Entity has transferred the financial asset such that it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.\n\nA financial asset is transferred if, and only if, the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- (i)  transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, or\n- (ii) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement where the Consolidated Entity is:\n- \u00b7 not obligated to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it collects equivalent amounts from the original asset\n- \u00b7 prohibited from selling or pledging the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients, and\n- \u00b7 obligated to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay, generally considered to be within 1 to 3 months.",

Any interest in the transferred and derecognised financial asset that is created or retained by the Consolidated Entity is recognised as a separate asset or liability.\n\nIn transfers where control over the asset is retained, the Consolidated Entity continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement as determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised from the Statements of financial position when the Consolidated Entity's obligation has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.\n\nGains and losses on the derecognition of debt financial assets and liabilities\n\nGains and losses arising from the derecognition of debt financial assets or financial liabilities are recognised in:\n\n- \u00b7 net trading income in respect of trading-related balances that are subsequently measured at amortised cost\n- \u00b7 investment income within other operating income and charges in respect of financial investments and loans to associates\n- \u00b7 other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges for all other financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts issued\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under AASB 9, or\n- \u00b7 the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n\n## Modification of financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is modified when its original contractual cash flows are renegotiated or modified. A financial asset that is renegotiated is derecognised if the rights to receive cash flows from the existing agreement have expired, either through replacement by a new agreement or the existing terms are substantially modified. To determine whether the existing terms are substantially modified, both qualitative and quantitative factors may be considered. Qualitative factors would, for example, include a consideration of whether and to what extent the modification is driven by financial difficulties of the borrower or where the terms are modified such that the instrument no longer meets the SPPI requirements.\n\nA financial liability that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms or if the existing terms are modified such that the renegotiated financial instrument is a substantially different financial instrument. The assessment on whether the terms are substantially different consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where the modification results in derecognition of the original financial instrument, the new financial instrument is recorded initially at its fair value and the resulting difference is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the nature of the financial instrument as described in the derecognition of financial instruments policy.\n\nFor financial instruments measured at amortised cost, and for debt financial assets measured at FVOCI, when the modification does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument is recalculated and a modification gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss is measured as the adjustment of the gross carrying amount to reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the instrument's original EIR.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified based on the business model within which the asset is held and on the basis of the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.\n\n## Business model assessment\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses judgement in determining the business model at the level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. In determining the business model, all relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment is used including:\n\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model is evaluated and reported to the Consolidated Entity's Senior Management personnel and senior executives\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected), and\n- \u00b7 Frequency, value, timing of and reasons for sales of assets in the portfolio and expectations about future sales activity.\n\n## Solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI)\n\nThe contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to determine whether these represent SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, consistent with a basic lending arrangement. This includes an assessment of whether the cash flows primarily reflect consideration for the time value of money and credit risk of the principal outstanding. Interest may also include consideration for other basic lending risks and costs including a reasonable profit margin.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet the SPPI criteria. Such an assessment would consider, for example, the impact of any of the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 Contingent events that could change the amount and/or timing of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 Leverage features that could change the economic characteristics of principal and interest cash flows introducing volatility inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement;\n- \u00b7 Prepayment features, to determine whether the amount due on early repayment substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and accrued interest which may include reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract;\n- \u00b7 Terms that limit the Consolidated Entity's claim to cash flows from specified assets - for example, through non-recourse or limited recourse arrangements - in a way that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method where:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements, and\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.\n\nInterest income is determined in accordance with the EIR method and recognised as part of interest and similar income.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at FVOCI if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to both collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.\n\nSubsequent changes in fair value are recognised in OCI, with the exception of interest (which is recognised as part of interest income), ECL (which is recognised in credit and other impairment charges/reversal) and foreign exchange gains and losses (which are recognised in net trading income) and is net of any related hedge accounting adjustments. When debt financial assets classified as at FVOCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from OCI to investment income in respect of debt financial investments and loans to associates, or to other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges for all other financial assets.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are subsequently measured at FVTPL.\n\nFor the purposes of the Consolidated Entity's financial statements, the FVTPL classification consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets that are held for active trading (held for trading (HFT)). This classification includes all derivative financial assets, except those that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL\n- \u00b7 financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved by managing the financial assets on a fair value basis in order to realise gains and losses as opposed to a business model in which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (FVTPL)\n- \u00b7 financial assets that fail the SPPI test (FVTPL), and\n- \u00b7 financial assets that have been designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch (DFVTPL).\n\nEquity financial assets that are not held for active trading are measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised as investment income within other operating income and charges.\n\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of debt financial assets measured at FVTPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial assets that are classified as HFT and financial assets managed on a fair value basis are recognised in net trading income\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of debt financial investments and loans to associates and joint ventures that fail SPPI are recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of all other FVTPL and DFVTPL financial assets are recognised as part of other income and charges within other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial assets is recognised as interest and similar income.\n\n## Reclassification of financial instruments\n\nThe Consolidated Entity reclassifies debt financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. Financial assets that are reclassified are subsequently measured based on the financial asset's new measurement category.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity does not reclassify financial liabilities after initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless they are either HFT, or have been designated to be measured at FVTPL (DFVTPL). A financial liability may be DFVTPL if:\n\n- \u00b7 such a designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise have arisen\n- \u00b7 a group of financial liabilities, or financial assets and financial liabilities, is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, or",

Refer to Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities for the detailed hedge accounting policy.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial liabilities that are not classified as HFT, with the exception of changes relating to the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk, are recognised in net trading income, or other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction. Changes in fair value relating to changes in the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk are presented separately in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial liabilities is recognised as interest and similar expense.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Statements of financial position, when there is a current legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and either there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the financial asset and settle the financial liability simultaneously.\n\n## (viii) Cash collateral on securities borrowed and lent and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\nAs part of its trading, financing and liquidity management activities, the Consolidated Entity borrows and lends securities, commodities and other assets (the underlying) on a collateralised basis. The underlying that is subject to the arrangement is not derecognised from the Statements of financial position of the relevant parties, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the initial holder.\n\nThese transactions include:\n\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity purchases an underlying under an agreement to resell\n- \u00b7 repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity sells an underlying under an agreement to repurchase.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity continually reviews the fair values of the underlying on which the above transactions are based and where appropriate, requests or provides additional collateral to support the transactions, in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements are subsequently measured as follows by the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 agreements that are collateralised with commodities are measured at amortised cost when they are held in a business model to collect contractual cash flows and AASB 9's SPPI criteria are met\n\n- \u00b7 agreements that are held within the Consolidated Entity's cash and liquid assets portfolio are measured at FVOCI as they are held in a business model to both collect contractual cash flows and with the intention to sell\n- \u00b7 all other reverse repurchase agreements are measured at FVTPL to reflect the Consolidated Entity's business model to realise fair value gains and losses as opposed to a business model in which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows.\n\nAlso refer to Note 37 Measurement categories of financial instruments .\n\nRepurchase agreements are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except where they are DFVTPL to eliminate an accounting mismatch created by managing the agreements together with the associated reverse repurchase agreements that are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## (ix) Trading assets and liabilities\n\nTrading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Consolidated Entity acquires or incurs principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or held as part of a portfolio that is managed together with short-term profit or position taking.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses trade date accounting when recording regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities that are classified as HFT. At the date a purchase transaction is entered into (trade date), the Consolidated Entity recognises the resulting financial asset or liability and any subsequent unrealised gain or loss arising from revaluing that contract to fair value as part of net trading income, except for interest income on HFT debt financial assets which is recognised in interest income. Refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\nTrading assets (long positions) comprise financial instruments such as debt and equity securities, bank bills, treasury notes, and loans, commodity contracts and commodities purchased with the intent of being actively traded either individually or as part of a portfolio.\n\nTrading liabilities comprise obligations to deliver assets (short positions) across the same trading categories and which the Consolidated Entity intends to actively trade.\n\nCommodity inventory is recognised when the Consolidated Entity controls the commodity, the determination of which includes consideration of price risk. Commodity inventory is measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption, on the basis that such assets are held with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin. Commodity contracts reflect agreements for the purchase and sale of commodities where, despite the Consolidated Entity having control over the commodity, the Consolidated Entity has no intention to exercise its control, and where the expected outcome is that the commodity will be sold back to the initial holder or sold on to the intended acquirer (in the case of intermediary trades). Such contracts are measured at FVTPL.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

These derivative instruments are principally used by the Consolidated Entity for the purposes of risk management of existing assets and liabilities and forecast transactions and are also entered into for client trading purposes.\n\nDerivatives are recognised in the Statements of financial position as an asset where they have a positive fair value at the reporting date or as a liability where they have a negative fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDerivatives that may have both positive or negative values must meet both the asset and liability derecognition tests before being derecognised from the Statements of financial position.\n\nFair values are obtained from quoted prices in active markets where available, or valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. The accounting for derivatives is subject to the application of the day 1 profit or loss policy as described in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments ).\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies trade date accounting to the recognition and derecognition of derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of its ongoing business, the Consolidated Entity is exposed to several financial risks, principally that of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks (collectively referred to as the hedged risk or exposure). The Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for such risks and has policies and practices in place to ensure that these risks are effectively managed. The Consolidated Entity mitigates these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, in the case of foreign exchange risk, foreign-denominated debt issued (collectively referred to as hedging instruments). The Consolidated Entity applies hedge accounting to manage accounting mismatches arising from the difference in measurement bases or location of the gains and losses recognised between the exposure that is being hedged and the hedging instrument.

Margin monies primarily represent deposits placed with clearing houses in relation to futures trading and other derivatives transactions. The balance includes both initial and variation margin which varies based on trading activities. The balance also includes client margin calls which are funded by the Consolidated Entity. Settlement balances represent outstanding trade timing balances as at the reporting date due to the timing difference between trade and settlement date. Balances are carried at amortised cost except for certain margin money and certain settlement balances which are carried at FVTPL.\n\n## (xii) Financial investments\n\nInvestment securities in this category include investments in equity or debt securities which are not actively traded by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nDebt investment securities in this category comprise liquid asset holdings, bonds, money markets and other debt securities.\n\nFinancial investments are initially recognised on trade date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for debt investments subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments ).\n\n## (xiii) Loan assets\n\nThis category includes loans that are not held for trading purposes and typically includes the Consolidated Entity's lending activities to its customers.\n\nLoan assets are initially recognised on settlement date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for loan assets subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments ).\n\nCertain finance lease receivables are also presented as part of asset financing within loan assets. For the detailed policy on financial instruments, including treatment of derecognition, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments ).\n\n## (xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost (which includes, where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset) less, accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, accumulated impairment losses.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets are initially measured at cost and comprise of the amount that corresponds to the amount recognised for the lease liability on initial recognition together with any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), initial direct costs and restoration-related costs. Subsequently, it is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, impairment losses, and adjusted for remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets includes assets leased out under operating leases.\n\nDepreciation is the process to allocate the difference between cost and residual values over the estimated useful life. Where the residual value exceeds the carrying value, no depreciation is charged. Depreciation is calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 unit of production method for certain infrastructure assets\n- \u00b7 straight-line basis for all other assets.\n\nA ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.\n\nAnnual depreciation rates are summarised below:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment                    | Depreciation rates   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                                        | 2.5 to 3.3%          |\n| Furniture, fittings and leasehold improvements 2 | 10 to 20%            |\n| Infrastructure assets and equipment 3            | 2.5 to 33%           |\n| Aviation                                         | 4%                   |\n| Meters                                           | 5 to 55%             |\n| Telecommunications                               | 24 %                 |\n| Equipment and other operating lease assets       | 2.5 to 30%           |\n\nUseful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and reassessed in the light of commercial and technological developments. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the asset's carrying amount and are recognised in other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nThe depreciation charge is recognised as part of:\n\n- \u00b7 net operating lease income for assets given on operating lease\n- \u00b7 occupancy expenses for corporate buildings, furniture, fittings and leasehold improvements\n- \u00b7 non-salary technology expenses for technology assets\n- \u00b7 net trading income for depreciation relating to leased assets held by trading-related businesses for the purpose of facilitating trading activities\n- \u00b7 other operating expenses for all other assets.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity does not recognise a ROU asset for short-term or low value leases, instead the expense is recognised over the lease term as appropriate as part of operating expenses.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Goodwill arising from business combinations is included in intangible assets.\n\n## Other acquired identifiable intangible assets\n\nAt the time at which the Consolidated Entity determines that it has acquired a business, the Consolidated Entity identifies intangible assets that are required to be initially recognised at fair value. An intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite useful life where it is expected to contribute to the Consolidated Entity's net cash inflows indefinitely.\n\nThe following intangible assets are typically identified and recognised by the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 licences and trading rights: generally carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. Where no contractual or legal limitation exists, these assets are not amortised because they are considered to have an indefinite useful life\n- \u00b7 management rights: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Certain management right intangible assets, which have indefinite useful lives as the underlying income stream is related to the management of funds that have no defined end date and are expected to operate perpetually, are not amortised. For management rights that have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of management rights over the estimated useful life usually being a period not exceeding 20 years\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts acquired with a finite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Amortisation is calculated over the period for which the customer relationship is expected to exist\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts with an indefinite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss.\n\nCertain other intangible assets held for trading, including emission certificates, are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption (on the basis that such assets are held with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin).\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets held by trading related business is recorded in net trading income and for others is recognised in other operating expenses. Impairments (reversal of impairments) of intangible assets are recognised in other impairment charges/ reversal.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nDevelopment expenditure is recognised as an asset when the Consolidated Entity is able to demonstrate that the project is technically feasible, it is probable the asset will generate future economic benefits, the Consolidated Entity has the intention and ability to complete the development of the project or sell it, and the costs incurred can be reliably measured. All other costs are expensed in the period incurred.\n\n## Software\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring and developing certain computer software programmes are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life, usually a period of three to seven years on a straight-line basis. The capitalised software asset is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.\n\nCosts incurred on the maintenance of software is expensed as incurred and recognised in other operating expenses.\n\n## (xvi) Deposits\n\nDeposits include customer deposits, business banking and home loan related deposits, deposits from financial institutions and other balances such as client monies. These deposits are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (xvii) Other assets and liabilities\n\n## Contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalised expenses\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity provides services to clients and the consideration is unconditional, a receivable is recognised. Where the consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time, such as performance fees, these are recorded as contract assets. Both receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with AASB 9. Commodity-related receivables are accounted for in accordance with Note (vii) Financial Instruments .\n\nThe Consolidated Entity, as permitted by AASB 15, has applied the practical expedient that allows for costs incurred to obtain a contract to be expensed as incurred where the amortisation period for any asset recognised would be less than 12 months. The Consolidated Entity also applies the practical expedient not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, where the period between transferring a good or service and when the customer pays for that good or service is expected to be one year or less.\n\nContract liabilities relate to prepayments received from customers where the Consolidated Entity is yet to satisfy its performance obligation.",

This line includes assets and liabilities of businesses and subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures, other assets and liabilities, and subsidiaries that are acquired exclusively with a view to sell or distribute.\n\nThese assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale when they are available for immediate sale in their present condition, the sale or distribution is highly probable and is expected to occur within 12 months. Where there is a planned partial disposal of a subsidiary resulting in loss of control, but the Consolidated Entity retains an interest in the disposed subsidiary, the entire disposal group is classified as held for sale.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Equity accounting, depreciation and amortisation is suspended when the held for sale criteria are met.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell and is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, limited to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of sale is recognised at the date of sale.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale are measured in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' policies.\n\n## Provisions, contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.\n\nContingent liabilities are either possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Consolidated Entity, or are present obligations where an outflow of economic resources is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless an outflow of economic resources is remote. Contingent liabilities generally include performance-related contingents and certain types of letters of credit and guarantees.\n\nCredit related commitments are the Consolidated Entity's firm commitments to provide credit facilities under pre-specified terms and conditions. These generally include loan commitments, financial guarantee contracts and certain types of letters of credit. Such contracts are recognised in the Statements of financial position only when drawn upon, and may expire without being called. Credit related commitments are subject to expected credit loss requirements disclosed in Note 13 Expected Credit Loss .\n\nContingent liabilities and commitments are disclosed in Note 33 Contingent liabilities and commitments .\n\n## Employee benefit provisions\n\nEmployee benefit provisions are recognised by the Consolidated Entity as and when the service has been rendered after deducting amounts already paid. The Consolidated Entity accrues for costs arising under applicable staff carry plans based on the expected cash outflows.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid salaries, salary-related costs and provisions for annual leave are recorded in the Statements of financial position at the salary rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Provisions for long service leave and other longterm benefits are recognised at the present value of expected future payments to be made.\n\nIn determining this amount, consideration is given to expected future salary levels and employee service histories. Expected future payments are discounted to their net present value using discount rates on high quality corporate bonds, except where there is no deep market, in which case rates on Government securities are used. Such discount rates have terms that match as closely as possible the expected future cash flows.\n\nProvisions for unpaid employee benefits are derecognised when the benefit is settled or is transferred to another entity and the Company and Consolidated Entity are legally released from the obligation and do not retain a constructive obligation.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWhere a dividend is determined or resolved by the Company's Board of Directors, consideration is given to the record date when determining the date on which the provision for the dividend is recognised in the Statements of financial position as a liability, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

These balances are:\n\n- \u00b7 initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, or\n- \u00b7 when DFVTPL, initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value.\n\n## (xix) Due to/from subsidiaries\n\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries principally arise from the provision of lending arrangements, acceptance of funds on deposit, intercompany services and transactions and the provision of financial guarantees. Intercompany services and transactions are accounted for in accordance with Note 44(iv) Revenue and expense recognition where they are transacted in a principal capacity. Financial assets, financial liabilities and financial guarantee contracts are accounted for in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments . Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net where the offsetting requirements are met, such that the net amount is reported in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (xx) Debt issued\n\nDebt issued includes debt securities issued by the Consolidated Entity. These balances are:\n\n- \u00b7 initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, or\n- \u00b7 when DFVTPL, initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's accounting policy for financial instruments, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments .\n\n## (xxi) Loan capital\n\nLoan capital represents issued debt with terms and conditions that qualify for inclusion as capital under Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Standards.\n\nCapital instruments are first assessed to determine whether the Consolidated Entity is required to deliver cash or another financial asset on the occurrence of a contingent event that is considered genuine and beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder (such as Common Equity Tier 1 Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events). Where such a contingent event exists, then the Consolidated Entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset and the capital instrument is classified as a financial liability. The financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nFor compound instruments that have both equity and liability features, the liability component is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (and is thereafter measured at amortised cost using the EIR method), with the residual being accounted for within the Consolidated Entity's equity.\n\n## (xxii) Impairment\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nThe ECL requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, lease receivables, amounts receivable from contracts with customers, loan commitments, certain letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts issued that are not DFVTPL. The Consolidated Entity applies a three-stage approach to measuring the ECL based on changes in the financial asset's underlying credit risk and includes forward looking information (FLI).\n\nECL is measured as the product of probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The calculation of ECL requires judgement and the choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for further information. Outcomes within the next financial period that are different from management's assumptions and estimates could result in changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised.\n\nThe ECL is determined with reference to the following stages:\n\n## (i) Stage I-12 month ECL\n\nAt initial recognition, and for financial assets for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, ECL is determined based on the probability of default (PD) over the next 12 months adjusted for FLI. Stage I also includes financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from Stage II.\n\n## (ii) Stage II-Not credit-impaired\n\nWhen there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the ECL is determined with reference to the financial asset's lifetime PD adjusted for FLI. The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether there has been a SICR since initial recognition based on qualitative, quantitative, and reasonable and supportable information that includes FLI. Detail on the Consolidated Entity's process to determine whether there has been a SICR is provided in Note 13 Expected credit losses .\n\nUse of alternative criteria could result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised. Lifetime ECL is generally determined based upon the contractual maturity adjusted, where appropriate, for prepayments, extension, call and similar options, of the financial asset. For revolving facilities, the Consolidated Entity exercises judgement based on the behavioural, rather than contractual characteristics of the facility type. Stage II may include financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from Stage III.",

This includes exposures that are at least 90 days past due and where the obligor is unlikely to pay without recourse against available collateral.\n\nThe ECL for credit impaired financial assets is generally measured as the difference between the contractual and expected cash flows from the individual exposure, discounted using the EIR for that exposure.\n\nPresentation of ECL allowances\n\nThe ECL allowances are presented in the Statements of financial position as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 loan assets, loans to related body corporate entities and subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 loan assets, loans to associates and joint ventures, and debt financial investments measured at FVOCI - as a reduction in the FVOCI reserve within equity. The carrying amount of the asset is not adjusted as it is measured at fair value\n- \u00b7 lease receivables, contract receivables and other assets measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 undrawn credit commitments and financial guarantees issued (not measured at FVTPL) - as a provision included in other liabilities.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity concludes that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering cash flows from the financial asset, and all possible collateral has been realised, the financial asset is written off, either partially or in full, against the related provision. Recoveries of loans previously written off are recorded based on the cash received.\n\n## Impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity performs an assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that its interests in associates or joint ventures are impaired. The main indicators of impairment are significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological market, economic or legal environment and a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.\n\nIn making this judgement, the Consolidated Entity evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price and the period of time for which fair value has been below cost. If there is an indication that an investment in an associate or joint venture may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, with its carrying amount.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement for investments in associates and joint ventures are subsequently reversed through the income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. The impairment losses (reversal of impairments) on investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised in the income statement as part of other impairment charges/reversal.\n\nFair value less costs to sell is estimated using market-based approaches using revenues, earnings and assets under management and multiples based on companies deemed comparable as well as other publicly available information relevant to the business.\n\nValue-in-use is calculated using pre-tax cashflow projections of operating revenue and expenses. Forecasts are extrapolated using a growth rate and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate incorporating market risk determinants, adjusted for specific risks related to the cash generating units, if any, and the environment in which it operates.\n\n## Impairment of investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries in the Company's financial statements are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal, for the amount by which the investment's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use. At each reporting date, investments in subsidiaries that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment. The amount of any reversal of impairment recognised must not cause the investment's carrying value to exceed its original cost.\n\n## Impairment of other non-financial assets including cash-generating units\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives (goodwill and certain intangible assets) are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor intangible assets that have a finite useful life and property, plant and equipment and ROU assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date for indications of impairment.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges as part of other operating income and charges for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",

Intangible assets (other than goodwill) for which an impairment loss has been recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. A reversal is recognised only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (xxiii) Performance based remuneration\n\n## Employee equity participation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity operates share-based compensation plans, which include awards (including those delivered through the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP)) granted to employees under share acquisition plans. Information relating to these schemes is set out in Note 32 Employee equity participation .\n\nThe Consolidated Entity accounts for its share-based payments as follows:\n\nEquity settled awards : The awards are measured at their grant date fair value and based on the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with a corresponding increase in equity with reference to the vesting period of those awards. Performance hurdles attached to Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the MEREP are not taken into account when determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest. For the Company, the accounting is dependent on whether the Company is compensated for its obligations under the MEREP award. To the extent that employing subsidiaries compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees, a recharge liability due to subsidiaries is recognised by the Company at grant date representing the payment received in advance of the award being settled. This liability reduces over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. MEREP liabilities are recognised and disclosed in Note 30 Related party information . To the extent that employing subsidiaries do not compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees', the Company reflects the provision of the equity settled award as a contribution to its subsidiary and as a result increases its investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. On vesting, amounts recognised in the share-based payments reserve are transferred to contributed equity.\n\nCash settled awards: The awards are measured at their grant date fair value and based on the number of instruments expected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with reference to vesting period of those awards which are settled in cash. The award liability is measured with reference to the number of awards and the fair value of those awards at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised in employment expenses.\n\n## Profit share remuneration\n\nThe Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and an expense for profit share remuneration to be paid in cash with reference to the performance period to which the profit share relates.\n\n## (xxiv) Leases\n\nAt the inception of a contract, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. At inception, or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Consolidated Entity allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component unless an election is made to account for the lease and non lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## (i) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is the lessee\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases office premises, commodity storage facilities, technology and other equipment for which contracts are typically entered into for fixed periods of 12 months to 15 years and may include extension options. Leases are recognised as an ROU asset (as explained in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets ) and a corresponding liability at the commencement date, being the date the leased asset is available for use by the Consolidated Entity.\n\n## Lease liability\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate). Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest expense.\n\nInterest expense is, unless capitalised on a qualifying asset which is not measured at fair value, recognised as part of interest and similar expense over the lease period on the remaining lease liability balance for each period. Any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are also recognised in the income statement in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in lease term, an assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, an index or rate, or a change in the estimated amount payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying value of the ROU asset, or, in the income statement, where the carrying value of the ROU asset has been reduced to zero.",

All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## Finance lease\n\nWhere finance leases are granted to third parties, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus an estimate of the value of any unguaranteed residual value is recognised as a receivable and included in loan assets.\n\nInterest income is recognised over the term of the lease using the EIR method, which reflects a constant rate of return. Finance lease income is presented within interest and similar income in the income statement.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity is the lessor under an operating lease, the underlying asset is carried at cost and depreciated over its useful life in accordance with the rates specified in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets . Operating lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and right of-use assets. Certain right-of-use assets are disclosed as investment property, as applicable.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease separately. The lease classification of the sublease is determined with reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (xxv) Contributed equity\n\nOrdinary shares and other similar instruments are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the issue proceeds.\n\nIf the Consolidated Entity reacquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (treasury shares) are recorded at cost and deducted from contributed equity. In cases where treasury shares are acquired and held by the Consolidated Entity, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable transactions costs net of tax, is deducted from contributed equity. Where the instruments are no longer held as treasury shares, any net consideration received is included in contributed equity, after deducting directly attributable transaction costs net of tax.\n\n## (xxvi) Fiduciary assets and client money\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages in trust, fund or other fiduciary activities as well as certain brokerage and other trading-related activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of third parties. Where such assets are controlled, and future economic benefits are expected to be realised by the Consolidated Entity, such assets and the income thereon are reflected in the Statements of financial position and income statement respectively.\n\nWhere this is not the case, these assets and the income thereon are excluded from the Consolidated Entity's financial statements as they are not the assets of the Consolidated Entity. Fee income earned by the Consolidated Entity relating to its responsibilities from fiduciary and brokerage and other trading-related activities is included as part of fee and commission income.\n\n## (xxvii) Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances includes currency on hand, demand deposits and short-term balances with Central and other banks including unallocated precious metal balances. These balances are subsequently measured at amortised cost except unallocated precious metals which are held at FVTPL.\n\n## (xxviii) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash and bank balances (except unallocated precious metal balances) as well as certain liquid financial investments and non trading reverse repurchase agreements that have a contractual maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are available to meet the Consolidated Entity's short-term cash commitments. Cash and cash equivalents exclude margin money balances, trading assets and certain client-related balances which are segregated from the Consolidated Entity's own funds and are thus restricted from use.\n\n## (xxix) Investment property\n\nInvestment properties are initially recognised at cost and subsequently stated at fair value at each reporting date. Any change in fair value, in addition to any lease income generated, is recognised in other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\n## (xxx) Comparatives\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been re-presented to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.\n\n## (xxxi) Rounding of amounts\n\nIn accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 , amounts in the Directors' Report and Financial Report have been rounded off to the nearest million Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries\n\n2024 Annual Report",
