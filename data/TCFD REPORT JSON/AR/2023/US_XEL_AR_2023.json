The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is a game-changing initiative that demonstrates how we're accelerating the development of the next generation of clean energy technology with signi/ficant bene/fits for our customers and the environment,' said Bob Frenzel, Xcel Energy chairman, president and CEO.\n\nThe project will use Xcel Energy's existing and future nuclear, solar and wind resources in the Upper Midwest to produce hydrogen to blend into power generation, existing natural gas distribution systems and other agricultural and industrial applications. The hub aims to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of taking 220,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road.\n\nXcel Energy also joined Bank of America, Delta Air Lines and Ecolab in establishing the Minnesota SAF Hub - an unparalleled collaboration among key players committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production to replace conventional jet fuel and reduce lifecycle carbon emissions of aviation by more than 80%. Xcel Energy's role will be to provide clean energy to sustainable aviation fuel production facilities across Minnesota, to ensure SAF production has as small a carbon footprint as possible.\n\nOur Colorado Clean Heat Plan , introduced this year, fast-tracks clean, resilient, innovative solutions while ensuring customers receive the reliable, affordable energy they need to power their lives. Designed to accommodate customers' unique needs, the plan offers a portfolio of solutions customers can choose from that work for them, leading to greater emission reductions at a lower cost.\n\n'Natural gas remains the most affordable way to heat customer homes and businesses, and customers deserve more choice to determine their own energy futures,' said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy-Colorado. 'Success will require partnership, collaboration and new, creative ways to accelerate customer choices so that customers can determine what emissions reductions solutions work best for their own needs and preferences.'\n\nIn Minnesota, our newly proposed $58 million, /five-year Natural Gas Innovation Plan includes a portfolio of innovative pilot projects across a broad array of technologies that, if scaled up in the future, have the potential to signi/ficantly reduce carbon emissions from the natural gas system while keeping costs affordable for customers. The proposal helps to maximize bene/fits from the federal In/flation Reduction Act, including approximately $18.6 million in anticipated tax credits and rebates.",

        "page_content": "## Climate resilience\n\nOver the last several years, like all companies, Xcel Energy has seen increases in severe weather - severe storms, extreme hot and cold temperatures, winds and droughts that affect our operations and ability to serve our customers. For that reason, the company is not only investing in the clean energy future; it is working to improve the resilience of its system today.\n\nWe are focused on resilience in many different areas of operations, but one is improving our ability to respond to the threat of wild/fires. Xcel Energy recognizes that wild/fires pose a signi/ficant threat to our customers and communities. As part of the company's commitment to resilience and safety, Xcel Energy makes strategic investments and improvements to support the power grid and build resilience. These efforts include system-hardening initiatives and inspections, operational and situational awareness efforts and connecting with stakeholders to understand the unique needs of each community\n\nIn 2023, Xcel Energy was selected for a $100 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy to continue the company's work to reduce and mitigate the evolving threat of wild/fires and ensure the resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Through the selected projects, Xcel Energy will take steps to increase grid resiliency, including adding /fire-resistant coatings to wood poles, improving equipment safety features in power lines and electric vehicle chargers in high /fire risk conditions, moving certain high-risk distribution circuits underground and enhancing vegetation management.\n\n## Long-term energy storage\n\nIn partnership with Form Energy, and with a $70 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $20 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, Xcel Energy plans to build two 10-megawatt, 100-hour\n\nbattery arrays near our retiring coal plants in Becker, Minnesota, and Pueblo, Colorado. Form Energy's iron-air batteries can deliver enough energy to power 2,000 homes for up to /five days. Both batteries would tap into our existing transmission system and make the renewable energy we generate more reliable and affordable.\n\n'Multi-day battery storage has the potential to help us better harness the renewable energy we generate while ensuring the grid remains reliable for our customers,' said Bria Shea, regional vice president, Planning and Policy for Xcel Energy-Minnesota. 'We look forward to bringing this system online at our Sherco site and learning more about the role it can play in our larger effort to reach 100% carbon-free electricity.'\n\n## Sherco Solar\n\nAs Xcel Energy retired one of three coal units at the Sherburne County Generating Plant in late 2023, building was already underway at the adjacent Sherco Solar site, slated to be the largest solar facility in the Midwest. When the /first two phases of the project are complete in 2025, the combined 710 megawatts will generate enough electricity to power more than 150,000 homes each year on average and fully replace the capacity of the coal-/fired Unit 2 that retired Dec. 31. The former Sherco Unit 2, built in 1977, will become a synchronous condenser, a piece of equipment that manages system stability as renewable energy increases, providing reliable electricity for customers.\n\n'Sherco has served our customers reliably for nearly 50 years, and we see tremendous potential for the plant site in the Upper Midwest's energy future,' said Ryan Long, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. 'Just as we're taking a phased approach to decommissioning the coal units, we're building replacement generation in phases to support clean, reliable and affordable energy for our customers.'",

For the last three years, the company has delivered wind turbine generator availability of more than 96%, saving customers over $1 billion in avoided fuel costs and tax credits.\n\n## Giving back\n\nThrough the Xcel Energy Foundation and our employee giving and volunteerism programs, we contributed more than $4.1 million to our communities in 2023, $2.2 million of which went to more than 1,700 nonpro/fit and community groups and was matched by funds from the Xcel Energy Foundation to local United Way chapters. At our annual Day of Service, more than 2,300 Xcel Energy employees and community members across the company's eight-state service area put good energy into action, contributing over 7,200 hours and delivering an economic impact of $230,000 in our communities.\n\n## Fostering a diverse workforce\n\nXcel Energy is committed to hiring and retaining a workforce that re/flects the diversity of our communities. This year, the company was honored to receive a top score on the Disability Equality Index, a top score on the Human Rights Campaign's annual Corporate Equality Index and recognition as a Five-Star Employer, a distinction for organizations that do the most to hire, retain, promote and support veterans. To further our support of former service members, the company introduced a new professional development program to help veterans.\n\n'Our veterans, guardsmen and reservists will play a critical role as we continue to lead the nation in clean energy while serving\n\nour customers affordably and reliably,' said chairman, president and CEO Bob Frenzel.\n\n## Investing in our community\n\nXcel Energy also understands the important role we play in the local economies of the communities we serve. As we deliver on our plan to exit coal by 2030 across all our service territories, we are committed to a just transition for employees and community members. The 2023 retirement of the Sherco Generating Plant in Becker, Minnesota, is proof of that commitment.\n\n'There's a lot of life left at the Sherco site, and our dedicated co-workers will manage the transition over the next decade,' said Michelle Neal, Sherco's plant director. 'The plant, and all those who keep it running well, have served as the backbone of the region's generation /fleet for decades.'\n\nThe new energy investments at the Sherco plant site will provide economic bene/fits in Becker and the surrounding area. Sherco Solar will bring 400 union construction jobs, 18 ongoing operations and maintenance jobs and an estimated $350 million in local economic bene/fits through payments to landowners and local governments. Our battery storage project plans at the site include 15 to 20 union construction jobs, and the Minnesota Energy Connection project will bring hundreds of jobs to build the transmission line and new wind and solar resources, plus an infrastructure investment of more than $1 billion for the region.\n\n## Our newly proposed Natural Gas Innovation\n\nPlan in Minnesota also includes a focus on local bene/fits, jobs and workforce development. If approved, the plan would create an estimated 417 construction and other jobs in Minnesota over /five years and would help to develop local expertise in growing careers such as renewable natural gas, hydrogen, district energy and strategic electri/fication.",

In 2023, we had the lowest level of system interruptions that we've experienced in the past 10 years.\n\n## Transmission upgrades\n\nThe transmission system is the backbone of the U.S. electric grid, with nearly 160,000 miles of high-voltage power lines carrying energy from where it is generated to where it is needed. Adequate transmission capacity is critical to delivering the signi/ficant amount of renewable energy generation needed to achieve Xcel Energy's clean energy goals.\n\nWith Colorado's Power Pathway , a historic infrastructure project launched in 2023, Xcel Energy began expansion of transmission\n\ncapacity to continue serving existing generation and plan for future renewable energy generation. The 550-mile Pathway will allow Xcel Energy to connect more than 5,000-megawatts of new renewable energy produced in eastern Colorado, one of the nation's best areas for wind and solar generation.\n\nIn the Upper Midwest, two projects being developed by Xcel Energy were awarded a signi/ficant portion of a $464 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to expand transmission lines, boost reliability and affordability and increase capacity to add new electricity generation to the grid. The coordinated projects will facilitate interconnection and our regional transmission organizations' ability to transfer energy between their regions, especially during\n\nextreme weather conditions.\n\nXcel Energy also has joined with other utilities in Grid North Partners to implement 19 transmission project upgrades - primarily to increase system capacity - that will enable more low-cost renewable energy to be delivered from western Minnesota to customers throughout the region. Expected to be built over the next three years, these projects will span Minnesota and touch eastern South Dakota with the goal of reducing congestion on the transmission system.",

'By collaborating with our regional transmission organizations, our fellow utilities and state agencies, we will continue to build out a grid that advances the transition to clean energy.'\n\n## Modernizing the distribution grid\n\nToday's grid is undergoing a dramatic shift: The addition of renewables, electric vehicles, and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) poses opportunities but also planning and operational challenges - and will continue to do so into the future. To maintain our reliable, affordable electric service and enable more /flexibility for customers, we are currently planning on investing approximately $1.6 billion in distribution technologies to meet the customer needs of today and tomorrow.\n\nThese investments include new network infrastructure, advanced software, equipment\n\nsensors and related data analytics capabilities. We are investing in smart meters with grid edge technology, other smart devices on the grid and technologies such as an advanced planning tool, which simulates the impact of load, including electric vehicles and other DER growth, to develop load forecasts that inform planning to ensure the system meets customers' evolving needs. We also implemented an advanced distribution management system that provides enhanced visibility and control of increasingly complex distribution grid operations, including 2 gigawatts of third-party DER that includes 900 megawatts of community solar gardens in Minnesota - one of the largest programs of its kind in the country. The deployment of a Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS) is an emerging approach to connect and manage DER on the utility system and is part of the company's nearterm grid modernization roadmap.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Deliver a Competitive Total Return to Investors\n\nSuccessful  strategy  execution,  along  with  our  disciplined  approach  to growth,  operations  and  management  of  environmental,  social  and governance issues, positions us to continue delivering a competitive TSR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  consistently  achieved  our  financial  objectives,  meeting  or exceeding our initial ongoing earnings guidance range for 19 consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for 21 consecutive years.\n\nOver the past five years, ongoing earnings per share have grown annually by 6.3% and our dividend per share by 6.5% annually. Xcel Energy works to  maintain  senior  secured  debt  credit  ratings  in  the  A  range  and  senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.\n\n## LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nXcel Energy manages the risk of climate change and has worked to meet the increasing demand for cleaner energy for over 20 years.\n\nOur sustainability commitments are summarized as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Companywide goal; work also underway to meet state clean energy goals in our service area. **Spans natural gas supply, delivery and customer use.\n\n## Carbon-free Electricity by 2050\n\nXcel  Energy  was  the  first  U.S.  utility  to  establish  a  carbon-free  vision, targeting  100%  carbon-free  electricity  by  2050  with  an  interim  goal  to reduce carbon emissions 80% by 2030 (from 2005 levels), including owned and  purchased  power.  A  lead  author  for  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that our vision aligns with science-based scenarios  likely  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5  degrees  Celsius  from  preindustrial levels, in alignment with the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nThe pace of achieving a carbon-free vision is also governed by reliability and  customer  affordability.  Our  approved  resource  plans  outline  a  clear, transparent  path  for  reducing  carbon  emissions  by  80%  using  current technologies, while maintaining customer bill increases at or below the rate of  inflation.  Moving  from  80%  carbon  reduction  to  100%  carbon-free electricity will require new, dispatchable technologies that are economically viable, as well as supportive public policy.\n\nSee  Item  1A  for  risks  and  uncertainties  related  to  strategic  and sustainability goals and objectives.\n\nXcel Energy's operating footprint includes some of the best wind and solar resources  in  the  country,  providing  for  higher  capacity  factors  and  lower operating  costs.  Our  'Steel  for  Fuel'  strategy  reduces  costs  for  our customers by taking advantage of these higher capacity factors along with savings  provided  by  renewable  tax  credits  and  avoided  fuel  costs  that mitigate higher cost fossil generation.\n\nThrough  2023,  we  reduced  carbon  emissions  from  generation  serving customers by an estimated 54% (from 2005 levels) and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction and fully exit coal by the end of 2030. At the same  time,  our  Steel  for  Fuel  strategy  has  saved  customers  nearly  $4 billion since 2017.\n\nXcel Energy's wind capacity is now over 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind. In Colorado, we anticipate adding an additional 1,850 MW of wind, 1,700 MW of solar, 1,850 MW of storage and 650 MW of gas generation to ensure reliability  on  our  system  by  2028.  In  Minnesota,  we have approvals for more than 700 MW of new solar at our Sherco facility, making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In 2024, we filed our  NSP Resource Plan, which proposes adding 3,600 MW of new wind and  solar,  600  MW  of  battery  storage  and  2,200  MW  of  dispatchable resources  by  2030,  pending  Commission  approval.  In  SPS,  we  filed  for approval  of  400  MW  of  solar  generation,  a  200  MW  PPA  and  a  broader system  IRP,  which  could  include  between  5,000  to  10,000  MW  of  new generation by 2030.\n\nBeyond  carbon,  we  have  significantly  reduced  other  emissions  and environmental impacts, including:\n\n*Reductions in water consumption are from owned and purchased electricity that serves our customers. All other reductions are from owned generating plants. **Coal ash and water consumption data are as of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "As  we  prepare  for  early  coal  plant  retirements,  employees  are  provided advanced  notice  and  offered  retraining  and  relocation  opportunities.  To date, we have been successful in avoiding layoffs associated with our early coal  plant  retirements.  We  also  help  foster  economic  development opportunities  to  offset  community  impacts  associated  with  coal  plant closures.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  long  track  record  of  working  with  our communities  on  energy,  climate  and  environmental  initiatives  that  impact them and has publicly committed to furthering environmental justice.\n\nSignificant  investment  in  our  transmission  and  distribution  systems  is essential to ensure resiliency and reliability for customers through the clean energy transition. We have nearly $12 billion in our 2024 - 2028 capital plan focused  specifically  on  this,  including  our  $1.7  billion  Pathway  project  in Colorado,  and  additional  investments  to  further  support  our  recently approved  Colorado  resource  portfolio.  As  part  of  MISO's  planned transmission  expansion  over  the  next  decade,  Xcel  Energy  has  been awarded $1.2 billion of projects as part of Tranche 1. We anticipate MISO Tranche 2 awards in 2024.\n\n## Natural Gas Use in Buildings -Net-Zero GHG by 2050\n\nXcel Energy is committed to reducing GHG emissions 25% by 2030 (from 2020  levels)  and  provide  net-zero  natural  gas  service  by  2050  from  the supply, distribution and end-use of natural gas. In 2023, we filed our Clean Heat  Plan  in  Colorado  and  Natural  Gas  Innovation  Plan  in  Minnesota, which provide a framework for this transition.\n\nSimilar  to  our  electric  plan,  the  lead  author  for  the  IPCC  confirmed  our vision to deliver natural gas service with net-zero emissions by 2050 aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit global warming by 1.5 C.\n\nOur net-zero natural gas frameworks include the following priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Work with suppliers to purchase only low emissions gas by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Operate  the  cleanest  possible  system  to  achieve  net-zero  methane emissions on the system by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Offer customer options for conservation, beneficial electrification, and clean fuels such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas.\n- \u00b7 Apply  high-quality  carbon  offsets  through  projects  that  remove emissions while providing additional environmental and social benefit.\n\n## Electrification of the Transportation Sector\n\nWe are also  helping  reduce  carbon  emissions  in  other  sectors,  including transportation.  We  aim  to  enable  one  out  of  five  vehicles  in  our  service areas to be electric by 2030, representing nearly $2 billion of investment, 0.6%  -  0.7%  of  average  incremental  annual  retail  sales  growth  and avoidance of roughly 5 million  tons  of  CO 2 emissions  annually.  By  2050, our  vision  is  to  run  all  vehicles  in  our  service  area  with  carbon-free electricity  or  other  clean  energy.  We  have  approved,  transportation electrification programs and plans in Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin and updated transportation plans pending commission approval in Minnesota and Colorado.\n\n## Innovation and Policy\n\nIn 2023, the Department of Energy announced awards of nearly $1.5 billion to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others in the Upper Midwest, received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This funding  will  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  a  clean  hydrogen  ecosystem  in  the region. The DOE also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to support our two  10-MW,  100-hour  battery  pilots  with  Form  Energy.  Combined  with grants committed by Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, we have secured up to $90 million to support these long duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost effective reliability in a high-renewable grid.\n\nXcel Energy was selected as part of two different awards from the DOE's Grid  Resilience  and  Innovation  Partnership  program.  The  DOE  awarded Xcel  Energy  $100  million  to  support  projects  to  mitigate  the  threat  of wildfires  and  ensure  resiliency  of  the  grid  through  extreme  weather.  Xcel Energy was also party to GRIP's $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve  inter-regional  transfer  capability,  reliability  and  resolve  grid constraints.\n\nXcel  Energy  actively  engages  in  wildfire  mitigation  activities  across  our operating territories.  For  the  past  three  years,  we  have  operated  under  a commission-approved wildfire plan in Colorado. We are currently evaluating updates  to  these  plans  with  a  wide  range  of  options  for  consideration including new technologies, undergrounding, additional vegetation management,  composite  poles,  selective  use  of  covered  conductor  and preventative power system shutoffs.\n\n## Sustainability Governance and Oversight\n\nIn 2000, we instituted oversight of environmental performance by the Board of Directors and were among the first U.S. energy providers to tie carbon reduction to executive compensation more than 15 years ago.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  provided  a  voluntary,  third-party  verified  annual  GHG disclosure since 2005, longer than any other U.S. utility. We are a founding member  of  The  Climate  Registry  and  a  supporter  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Our disclosures also align with the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals frameworks.\n\n## ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nXcel Energy has invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a portfolio  of  renewable  and  conservation  programs  that  provide  customers with  clean  energy  options  and  help  keep  bills  low.  New  demand  remains robust  in  our  territories,  including  load  growth  from  new  data  centers, industrial  electrification  and  electric  vehicle  adoption.  As  such,  we  are transforming and expanding our electric grid to accommodate load growth, renewable energy and distributed energy resources.\n\nWe are in the process of installing smart electric meters, which will deliver customer and operational benefits, providing near-real-time communication, allowing customers to know how much energy they are using and what it will cost. In addition, customers will have new digital tools to make it easier to access their energy information, gain useful insights to understand and manage their energy use and make energy choices that lower their bills.\n\n## KEEP BILLS LOW\n\nCustomer  affordability  is  critical  to  successful  strategy  execution.  From 2014 - 2023, we have kept residential electric bill growth to 1.8% per year and natural gas bill growth to 1.1% per year, both below the rate of inflation. Based on available EIA data, the five year average residential electric and natural gas bills for an Xcel Energy customer were 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively.\n\nGoing  forward,  our  goal  is  to  enable  the  clean  energy  transition  while keeping customer bill growth below the rate of inflation through initiatives including conservation programs, O&M cost control, our One Xcel Energy Way  lean  management  initiative,  advanced  operational  technologies  and our Steel for Fuel program.",

Xcel  Energy  has  a  vast  distribution network, owning and operating approximately 215,000 conductor miles of distribution lines across our eight-state service territory.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy has invested approximately $1.1 billion of $1.6  billion  to  implement  new  network  infrastructure,  smart  meters, advanced  software,  equipment  sensors  and  related  data  analytics capabilities.\n\nThese  investments  will  improve  reliability  and  reduce  outage  restoration times for our customers, while enabling new options and opportunities for increased  efficiency  savings.  The  new  capabilities  will  also  enable integration  of  battery  storage  and  other  distributed  energy  resources  into the grid, including electric vehicles.\n\nSee Item 2 - Properties for further information.\n\n## Natural Gas Operations\n\nNatural gas operations consist of purchase, transportation and distribution of natural gas to end-use residential, C&I and transport customers in NSPMinnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo.  Xcel  Energy  had  natural  gas deliveries  of  406,742  (thousands  of  MMBtu),  2.2  million  customers  and natural gas revenues of $2,645 million for 2023.\n\n| Natural Gas  (percentage of total)   | Deliveries   | Number of  Customers   | Revenues   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Residential                          | 37 %         | 92 %                   | 59 %       |\n| C&I                                  | 24           | 8                      | 31         |\n| Transportation and other             | 39           | <1                     | 10         |\n\n## Sales/Revenue Statistics (a)\n\n|                                            | 2023     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| MMBtu sales per retail customer            | 115      | 116      |\n| Revenue per retail customer                | $  1,113 | $  1,318 |\n| Residential revenue per MMBtu              | 10.54    | 11.97    |\n| C&I revenue per MMBtu                      | 8.48     | 10.45    |\n| Transportation and other revenue per MMBtu | 1.01     | 1.16     |\n\n## Capability and Demand\n\nNatural  gas  supply  requirements  are  categorized  as  firm  or  interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply).\n\nMaximum daily output (firm and interruptible) and occurrence date:\n\n|                    | 2023      | 2023    | 2022      | 2022    |\n|--------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Utility Subsidiary | MMBtu     | Date    | MMBtu     | Date    |\n| NSP-Minnesota      | 753,642   | Feb. 3  | 867,385   | Feb. 12 |\n| NSP-Wisconsin      | 158,029   | Jan. 30 | 187,961   | Jan. 6  |\n| PSCo               | 2,190,155 | Jan. 30 | 2,243,552 | Dec. 22 |\n\n## Natural Gas Supply and Cost\n\nXcel  Energy  seeks  natural  gas  supply,  transportation  and  storage alternatives  to  yield  a  diversified  portfolio,  which  increases  flexibility, decreases interruption, financial risks and customer rates. In addition, the utility subsidiaries conduct natural gas price hedging activities approved by their states' commissions.\n\nAverage  delivered  cost  per  MMBtu  of  natural  gas  for  regulated  retail distribution:\n\n| Utility Subsidiary   |   2023 | 2022    |\n|----------------------|--------|---------|\n| NSP-Minnesota        |   5.31 | $  7.00 |\n| NSP-Wisconsin        |   5.26 | 6.68    |\n| PSCo                 |   4.91 | 6.33    |\n\nNSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo  have  natural  gas  supply transportation  and  storage  agreements  that  include  obligations  for purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes or to make payments in lieu of delivery.\n\n## General\n\n## General Economic Conditions\n\nEconomic  conditions  may  have  a  material  impact  on  Xcel  Energy's operating  results.  Management  cannot  predict  the  impact  of  fluctuating energy or commodity prices, pandemics, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. We could experience a material impact to our results of operations, future  growth  or  ability  to  raise  capital  resulting  from  a  sustained  general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates or inflation.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nDemand  for  electric  power  and  natural  gas  is  affected  by  seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result,  the  overall  operating  results  may  fluctuate  substantially  on  a seasonal  basis.  Additionally,  Xcel  Energy's  operations  have  historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in  the  winter  and  cooler  in  the  summer.  Sales  true-up  and  decoupling mechanisms mitigate the impacts of weather in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## Competition\n\nXcel  Energy  is  subject  to  public  policies  that  promote  competition  and development  of  energy  markets.  Xcel  Energy's  industrial  and  large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition,  customers  may  have  the  option  of  substituting  other  fuels  or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region.\n\nCustomers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation  including  solar  generation  and  can  currently  avoid  paying  for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them in most jurisdictions.\n\nSeveral  states  have  incentives  for  the  development  of  rooftop  solar, community  solar  gardens  and  other  distributed  energy  resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy's electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies.\n\nThe  FERC  has  continued  to  promote  competitive  wholesale  markets through  open  access  transmission  and  other  means.  Xcel  Energy's wholesale  customers  can  purchase  energy  from  generation  resources  of competing generation resources quantities and transmission services from other service providers to serve their native load.",

        "page_content": "FERC Order No. 1000 established competition for ownership of certain new electric transmission facilities under Federal regulations. Some states have state laws that allow the incumbent a Right of First Refusal to own these transmission facilities.\n\nFERC Order 2222 requires that RTO and ISO markets allow participation of aggregations  of  distributed  energy  resources.  This  order  is  expected  to incentivize  distributed  energy  resource  adoption,  however  implementation is  expected  to  vary  by  RTO/ISO  and  the  near,  medium,  and  long-term impacts of Order 2222 remain unclear.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. No municipalization activities are occurring presently.\n\nWhile each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.\n\n## Governmental Regulations\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nOur  facilities  are  regulated  by  federal  and  state  agencies  that  have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations,  permits,  licenses,  inspections  and  approvals  from  these agencies.\n\nXcel Energy has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued  operation  of  its  generation,  transmission  and  distribution systems.  Our  facilities  strive  to  operate  in  compliance  with  applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements.\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  what  additional  facilities  or modifications to existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes  to  regulations,  interpretations  or  enforcement  policies  or  what effect  future  laws  or  regulations  may  have.  We  may  be  required  to  incur expenditures in the future for remediation of historic and current operating sites and other waste treatment, storage and disposal sites.\n\nThere are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs.\n\n## Emerging Environmental Regulation\n\n## Clean Air Act\n\nPower  Plant  Greenhouse  Gas  Regulations -In  May  2023,  the  EPA published  proposed  rules  addressing  control  of  CO 2 emissions  from  the power sector. The rule proposed regulations for new natural gas generating units  and  emission  guidelines  for  existing  coal  and  certain  natural  gas generation. The proposed rules create subcategories of coal units based on planned  retirement  date  and  subcategories  of  natural  gas  combustion turbines  and  combined  cycle  units  based  on  utilization.  The  CO 2 control requirements  vary  by  subcategory.  Until  final  rules  are  issued,  it  is  not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy believes that the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\n\n## Coal Ash Regulation\n\nIn  May  2023,  the  EPA  published  proposed  rules  to  regulate  legacy  CCR surface  impoundments  at  inactive  facilities  and  previously  exempt  areas where CCR was placed directly on land at regulated CCR facilities under the  CCR  Rule  for  the  first  time.  The  proposed  rule  would  subject  these areas  to  the  CCR  Rule  requirements,  including  groundwater  monitoring, corrective  action,  closure,  and  post-closure  care  requirements,  among other requirements, with several of the deadlines accelerated.\n\nThe  EPA  has  committed  to  a  May  2024  publication  date  for  those  new rules.  It  is  also  anticipated  that  the  EPA  may  issue  other  CCR  proposed rules  in  2024  and  2025  that  further  expand  the  scope  of  the  CCR  Rule. Until final rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy.  Xcel  Energy  believes  that  the  cost  of  these  initiatives  would  be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\n\n## Emerging Contaminants of Concern\n\nPFAS are man-made chemicals that are widely used in consumer products and can persist and bio-accumulate in the environment. Xcel Energy does not  manufacture  PFAS  but  because  PFAS  are  so  ubiquitous  in  products and the environment, it may impact our operations.\n\nIn September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two types of PFAS as 'hazardous  substances'  under  the  CERCLA.  In  March  2023,  the  EPA published a proposed rule that would establish enforceable drinking water standards  for  certain  PFAS  chemicals.  Final  rules  are  expected  in  2024. Costs are uncertain until a final rule is published.\n\nThe  proposed  rules  could  result  in  new  obligations  for  investigation  and cleanup.  Xcel  Energy  is  monitoring  changes  to  state  laws  addressing PFAS. The impact of these proposed regulations is uncertain.\n\n## Effluent Limitation Guidelines\n\nIn March 2023, the EPA released a proposed rule under the Clean Water Act,  setting  forth  proposed  Effluent  Limitations  Guidelines  and  Standards for  steam  generating  coal  plants.  This  proposed  rule  establishes  more stringent  wastewater discharge standards for bottom ash transport water, flue-gas  desulfurization  wastewater,  and  combustion  residuals  leachate from steam electric power plants, particularly coal-fired power plants. The impact  of  these  proposed  regulations  is  uncertain  until  a  final  rule  is published.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control.  Risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  business,  financial  condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the  risks  are  interrelated.  These  risks  should  be  carefully  considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC.\n\nWhile  we  believe  we  have  identified  and  discussed  below  the  key  risk factors  affecting  our  business,  there  may  be  additional  risks  and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\n\n## Oversight of Risk and Related Processes\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining  an  effective  risk  monitoring  process.  Management  and  the Board  of  Directors'  committees  have  responsibility  for  overseeing  the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  a  robust  compliance  program  and  promotes  a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process  includes  adherence  to  our  Code  of  Conduct  and  compliance policies,  operation  of  formal  risk  management  structures  and  overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.\n\nManagement  identifies  and  analyzes  risks  to  determine  materiality  and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and  risk  analysis  occurs  formally  through  risk  assessment  conducted  by senior management,  the  financial  disclosure  process,  hazard  risk procedures,  internal  audit  and  compliance  with  financial  and  operational controls.\n\nManagement  also  identifies  and  analyzes  risk  through  the  business planning  process,  development  of  goals  and  establishment  of  key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel  Energy's  strategy.  The  business  planning  process  also  identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.\n\nManagement communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates  a  periodic  risk  assessment  to  the  Board  of  Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including  financial  impact,  timing,  likelihood  and  mitigating  factors.  The Board of Directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which  includes  areas  of  existing  and  future  macroeconomic,  financial, operational, policy, environmental, safety and security risks.\n\nThe  oversight,  management  and  mitigation  of  risk  is  an  integral  and continuous part of the Board of Directors' governance of Xcel Energy. The Board  of  Directors  assigns  oversight  of  critical  risks  to  each  of  its  four committees  to  confirm  these  risks  are  well  understood  and  given appropriate focus.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  the committees'  risk  oversight  and  affirming  appropriate  aggregate  oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.\n\nEmerging  risks  are  considered  and  assigned  as  appropriate  during  the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. Additionally, the Board  of  Directors  conducts  an  annual  strategy  session  where  Xcel Energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\n\n## Risks Associated with Our Business\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\n\nOur  natural  gas  transmission  and  distribution  activities  include  inherent hazards  and  operating  risks,  such  as  leaks,  explosions,  outages  and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages.\n\nThese  risks  could  result  in  loss  of  life,  significant  property  damage, environmental  pollution,  impairment  of  our  operations  and  substantial financial  losses  to  employees,  third-party  contractors,  customers  or  the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses.\n\nThe  occurrence  of  these  events,  if  not  fully  covered  by  insurance,  could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.\n\nOther  uncertainties  and  risks  inherent  in  operating  and  maintaining  Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.\n- \u00b7 Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other supplies.\n- \u00b7 Impact of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, tornadoes, avalanches, icing events, floods, high winds and droughts.\n- \u00b7 Performance  below  expected  or  contracted  levels  of  output  or efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Availability of replacement equipment.\n- \u00b7 Availability  of  adequate  water  resources  and  ability  to  satisfy  water intake and discharge requirements.\n- \u00b7 Availability or changes to wind patterns.\n- \u00b7 Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.\n- \u00b7 Use of new or unproven technology.\n- \u00b7 Risks  associated  with  dependence  on  a  specific  type  of  fuel  or  fuel source,  such  as  commodity  price  risk,  availability  of  adequate  fuel supply  and  transportation  and  lack  of  available  alternative  fuel sources.\n- \u00b7 Increased  competition  due  to,  among  other  factors,  new  facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  our  natural  gas  infrastructure  could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT's  national  regulatory  program  to  assure  the  safe  transportation  of natural  gas,  petroleum  and  other  hazardous  materials  by  pipelines.  The PHMSA  continues  to  develop  regulations  and  other  approaches  to  risk management  to  assure  safety  in  design,  construction,  testing,  operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant  incident  or  material  finding  of  non-compliance  could  result  in penalties and higher costs of operations.\n\nOur  natural  gas  and  electric  transmission  and  distribution  operations  are dependent  upon  complex  information  technology  systems  and  network infrastructure,  the  failure  of  which  could  disrupt  our  normal  business operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to process transactions and provide services.\n\n## Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  long-term  planning  and  project risks.\n\nMost utility investments are planned to be used for decades. Transmission and generation investments typically have long lead times and are planned well  in  advance  of  in-service  dates  and  typically  subject  to  long-term resource plans. These plans are based on numerous assumptions such as: sales growth, customer usage, commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory  mechanisms,  customer  behavior,  available  technology  and public  policy.  Xcel  Energy's  long-term  resource  plan  is  dependent  on  our ability  to  obtain  required  approvals  (including  regulatory  approval  in jurisdictions  where  Xcel  Energy  operates),  develop  necessary  technical expertise,  allocate  and  coordinate  sufficient  resources  and  adhere  to budgets and timelines.\n\nIn  addition,  the  long-term  nature  of  both  our  planning  processes  and  our asset  lives  are  subject  to  risk.  The  utility  sector  is  undergoing  significant change (e.g., increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of distributed generation  and  shifts  away  from  fossil  fuel  generation  to  renewable generation).  Customer  adoption  of  these  technologies  and  increased energy  efficiency  could  result  in  excess  transmission  and  generation resources,  downward  pressure  on  sales  growth,  and  potentially  stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.\n\nThe magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning.  Efforts  to  electrify  the  transportation  and  building  sectors  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  result  in  higher  electric  demand  and  lower natural  gas  demand  over  time.  New  data  centers  and  crypto  mining facilities  could  generate  significant  increase  in  demand.  Higher  electric demand may require us to  adopt  new  technologies  and  make  significant transmission and distribution investments including advanced  grid infrastructure,  which  increases  exposure  to  overall  grid  instability  and technology  obsolescence.  Evolving  stakeholder  preference  for  lower emissions from generation sources and end-uses, like heating, may impact our  resource  mix  and  put  pressure  on  our  ability  to  recover  capital investments in natural gas generation and delivery. Multiple states may not agree  as  to  the  appropriate  resource  mix,  which  may  lead  to  costs  to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.\n\nWe require inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water. Lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.\n\n## Our utilities are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules.\n\nOur products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers. A  shortage  of  key  components  in  which  an  alternative  supplier  is  not identified  could  significantly  impact  operations  and  project  plans  for  Xcel Energy and our customers. Such impacts could include timing of projects and  the  potential  for  project  cancellation.  Failure  to  adhere  to  project budgets  and  timelines  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## We are  subject  to  commodity  risks  and  other  risks  associated  with energy markets and energy production.\n\nA  significant  increase  in  fuel  costs  could  cause  a  decline  in  customer demand,  adverse  regulatory  outcomes  and  an  increase  in  bad  debt expense which may have a material impact on our results of operations. Despite  existing  fuel  cost  recovery  mechanisms  in  most  of  our  states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are  not  recovered.  Delays  in  the  timing  of  the  collection  of  fuel  cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.\n\nA  significant  disruption  in  supply  could  cause  us  to  seek  alternatives  at potentially  higher  costs.  Additionally,  supply  shortages  may  not  be  fully resolved,  which  negatively  impacts  our  ability  to  provide  services  to  our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Also, significantly  higher  energy  or  fuel  costs  relative  to  sales  commitments negatively impacts our cash flows and results of operations.\n\nWe  also  engage  in  wholesale  sales  and  purchases  of  electric  capacity, energy  and  energy-related  products  as  well  as  natural  gas.  In  many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various  statutes  and  commission  rulings.  As  a  result,  we  are  subject  to market supply and commodity price risk.\n\nCommodity price  changes  can  affect  the  value  of  our  commodity  trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily  basis.  Settlements  can  vary  significantly  from  estimated  fair  values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated  with  hedging  and  trading  is  based,  in  part,  on  programs  and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.\n\nPublic  perception  often  does  not  distinguish  between  pass  through commodity costs and base rates. High commodity prices that are passed through to customer bills could impact our ability to recover costs for other improvements and operations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from  historical  pricing,  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  fully  assure  that  its  risk management  programs  and  procedures  would  be  effective  to  protect against all significant adverse market deviations.\n\nIn addition, Xcel Energy cannot fully assure that its controls will be effective against  all  potential  risks.  If  such  programs  and  procedures  are  not effective,  Xcel  Energy's  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash flows could be materially impacted.",

        "page_content": "## Failure  to  attract  and  retain  a  qualified  workforce  could  have  an adverse effect on operations.\n\nThe competition for talent has become increasingly prevalent, and we have experienced increased employee turnover due to the condition of the labor market and decisions related  to  strategic  workforce  planning.  In  addition, specialized  knowledge  and  skills  are  required  for  many  of  our  positions, which may pose additional difficulty for us as we work to recruit, retain and motivate employees in this climate.\n\nFailure to hire, adequately  train replacement  employees,  transfer knowledge/expertise  or  future  availability  and  cost  of  contract  labor  may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Inability to attract  and  retain  these  employees  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nOur businesses have collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Failure  to  renew  or  renegotiate  these  contracts  could  lead  to  labor disruptions,  including  strikes  or  boycotts.  Such  disruptions  or  any negotiated wage or benefit increases could have a material adverse impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nNational  unionization  efforts  could  affect  our  business,  as  an  increase  in unionized workers could challenge our operational efficiency and increase costs.\n\n## Our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.\n\nWe rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction  work.  Our  contractual  arrangements  with  these  contractors typically  include  performance  and  safety  standards,  progress  payments, insurance  requirements  and  security  for  performance.  Poor  vendor performance or contractor unavailability could impact ongoing operations, restoration  operations,  regulatory  recovery,  our  reputation  and  could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.\n\n## Our  employees,  directors,  third-party  contractors,  or  suppliers  may violate or be perceived to violate our Codes of Conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  risk  of  employee  or  third-party  contractor  fraud  or misconduct.  All  employees  and  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are subject  to  compliance  with  our  Code  of  Conduct  and  are  required  to participate  in  annual  training.  Additionally,  suppliers  are  subject  to compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nXcel  Energy  does  not  tolerate  discrimination,  violations  of  our  Code  of Conduct  or  other  unacceptable  behaviors.  However,  it  is  not  always possible  to  identify  and  deter  misconduct  by  employees  and  other  thirdparties,  which  may  result  in  governmental  investigations,  other  actions  or lawsuits.  If  such  actions  are  taken  against  us  we  may  suffer  loss  of reputation  and  such  actions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Our  subsidiary,  NSP-Minnesota,  is  subject  to  the  risks  of  nuclear generation.\n\nNSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, PI and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Hazards  associated  with  the  use  of  radioactive  material  in  energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.\n- \u00b7 Limitations  on  insurance  available  to  cover  losses  that  may  arise  in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to  an  insurance  pool  in  the  event  of  damages  at  a  covered  U.S. reactor.\n- \u00b7 Technological  and  financial  uncertainties  related  to  the  costs  of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.\n\nThe NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for  the  operation  of  nuclear  generation  facilities,  including  the  ability  to impose fines  and/or  shut  down  a  unit  until  compliance  is  achieved.  NRC safety  requirements  could  necessitate  substantial  capital  expenditures  or an  increase  in  operating  expenses.  In  addition,  the  INPO  reviews  NSPMinnesota's nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO's recommendations  could  result  in  substantial  capital  expenditures  or  a substantial increase in operating expenses.\n\nIf a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Furthermore,  noncompliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could  result  in  increased  industry  regulation,  which  may  increase  NSPMinnesota's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur  profitability  depends  on  the  ability  of  our  utility  subsidiaries  to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation  by  federal  and  state  utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.\n\nThe  profitability  of  our  utility  operations  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earn a return on capital investment. Our rates are generally regulated and are based on an  analysis  of  the  utility's  costs  incurred  in  a  test  year.  The  utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may  or  may  not  match  its  costs  at  any  given  time.  Rate  regulation  is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\n\nThere can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all  the  costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.\n\nOverall,  management  believes  prudently  incurred  costs  are  recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the  regulatory  environment  that  could  impair  the  ability  of  our  utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.",

While regulation typically provides cost recovery for these types of changes, there is  no  assurance  that  regulators  would  allow  full  recovery  of  all  remaining costs.\n\nHigher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries  will  not  be  able  to  fully  recover  their  fuel  costs  from  their customers.\n\nAdverse regulatory rulings (including changes in recovery mechanisms) or the  imposition  of  additional  regulations  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on our  results  of  operations  and  materially  affect  our  ability  to  meet  our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock.\n\n## Any  reductions  in  our  credit  ratings  could  increase  our  financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\n\nOur  credit  ratings  are  subject  to  change  and  our  credit  ratings  may  be lowered  or  withdrawn  by  a  rating  agency.  Significant  events  including disallowance  of  costs,  use  of  historic  test  years,  elimination  of  riders  or interim  rates,  increasing  depreciation  lives,  lower  returns  on  equity, changes  to  equity  ratios  and  impacts  of  tax  policy  may  impact  our  cash flows  and  credit  metrics,  potentially  resulting  in  a  change  in  our  credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.\n\nAny credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. It could also impact our ability to access capital markets. Also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require  posting  of  collateral  or  settlement  if  credit  ratings  fall  below investment grade.\n\n## We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\n\nUtility  operations  require  significant  capital  investment.  As  a  result,  we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. Capital market  disruption  and  financial  market  distress  could  prevent  us  from issuing  commercial  paper,  issuing  new  securities  or  cause  us  to  issue securities  with  unfavorable  terms  and  conditions,  such  as  higher  interest rates  or  lower  proceeds  from  equity  issuances.  Higher  interest  rates  on short-term  borrowings  with  variable  interest  rates  could  also  have  an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe  performance  of  capital  markets  impacts  the  value  of  assets  held  in trusts  to  satisfy  future  obligations  to  decommission  NSP-Minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit  plan  obligations.  These  assets  are  subject  to  market  fluctuations and  yield  uncertain  returns,  which  may  fall  below  expected  returns.  A decline  in  the  market  value  of  these  assets  may  increase  funding requirements. Additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear  decommissioning  and/or  pension  trusts  may  be  impacted  by changes in interest rates.\n\n## We are subject to credit risks.\n\nCredit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in our cash flow and liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and  services  provided,  the  economy  and unemployment rates.\n\nCredit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. Should the counterparties  fail  to  perform,  we  may  be  forced  to  enter  into  alternative arrangements.  In  that  event,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely affected and incur losses.\n\nXcel Energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may  also  have  some  indirect  credit  exposure  due  to  participation  in organized markets, (e.g., MISO, SPP, ERCOT and California Independent System Operator), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants.\n\nWe  have  additional  indirect  credit  exposure  to  financial  institutions  from letters  of  credit  provided  as  security  by  power  suppliers  under  various purchased power contracts. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.\n\n## Increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial condition or cash flows.\n\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our  employees.  Assumptions  related  to  future  costs,  return  on investments,  interest  rates  and  other  actuarial  assumptions  have  a significant  impact  on  our  funding  requirements  of  these  plans.  Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the  minimum  funding  requirements  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future.\n\nAlso, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single  year,  due  to  high  numbers  of  retirements  or  employees  leaving, would  trigger  settlement  accounting  and  could  require  Xcel  Energy  to recognize  incremental  pension  expense  related  to  unrecognized  plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in  key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.\n\n## Increasing  costs  associated  with  health  care  plans  may  adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIncreasing levels  of  large  individual  health  care  claims  and  overall  health care  claims  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Health  care  legislation  could  also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.\n\n## We  must  rely  on  cash  from  our  subsidiaries  to  make  dividend payments.\n\nInvestments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our operating cash flow and ability to service our debt and pay dividends depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their payment of dividends.\n\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any  amounts  due  pursuant  to  our  obligations  or  to  make  any  funds available for dividends on our common stock. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which  may  include  requirements  to  maintain  minimum  levels  of  equity ratios, working capital or assets.",

        "page_content": "If  the  utility  subsidiaries  were  to  cease  making  dividend  payments,  our ability  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock  or  otherwise  meet  our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated  by  state  utility  commissions,  which  possess  broad  powers  to prioritize  that  the  needs  of  the  utility  customers  are  met.  We  may  be negatively  impacted  by  the  actions  of  state  commissions  that  limit  the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.\n\n## Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  collect  estimated  federal,  state  and  local  tax payments  through  their  regulated  rates.  Changes  to  federal  tax  law  may benefit  or  adversely  affect  our  earnings  and  customer  costs.  Tax depreciable  lives  and  the  value/availability  of  various  tax  credits  or  the timeliness  of  their  utilization  may  impact  the  economics  or  selection  of resources. If tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic Risks\n\n## Economic conditions impact our business.\n\nXcel  Energy's  operations  are  affected  by  economic  conditions,  which correlates  to  customers/sales  growth  (decline).  Economic  conditions  may be  impacted  by  recessionary  factors,  rising  interest  rates  and  insufficient financial  sector  liquidity  leading  to  potential  increased  unemployment, which may impact customers' ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  face  competitive  factors,  which  could  have  an adverse impact on our financial condition , results  of  operations  and  cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital-intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There  may  be  delays  before  these  additional  material  costs  can  be recovered in rates.\n\nThe oil and gas industry represents our largest commercial and industrial customer  base.  Oil  and  natural  gas  prices  are  sensitive  to  market  risk factors which may impact demand.\n\n## We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\nHealth  epidemics  impact  countries,  communities,  supply  chains  and markets. Uncertainty continues to exist regarding epidemics; the duration and magnitude of business restrictions including shutdowns (domestically and globally); the potential impact on the workforce including shortages of employees  and  third-party  contractors  due  to  quarantine  policies, vaccination  requirements  or  government  restrictions;  impacts  on  the transportation of goods, and the generalized impact on the economy.\n\nWe  cannot  ultimately  predict  whether  an  epidemic  will  have  a  material impact  on  our  future  liquidity,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations. Nor can we predict the impact on the health of our employees, our supply chain  or  our  ability  to  recover  higher  costs  associated  with  managing  an outbreak.\n\n## Operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.\n\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities  and  information  and  control  systems  may  be  targets  of  terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues  and  additional  costs  to  repair  and  insure  our  assets.  These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  business.  We  have  incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\n\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources,  could  negatively  impact  our business,  brand  and  reputation.  Because  our  facilities  are  part  of  an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.\n\nWe also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such  as  severe  storms,  temperature  extremes,  wildfires  (particularly  in Colorado), widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a workforce disruption.\n\nIn addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. While we have business continuity plans in place, our ability to recover  may  be  prolonged  due  to  the  type  and  extent  of  the  event.  Xcel Energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in  the  delay  of  equipment  and  materials  that  may  impact  our  ability  to connect, restore and reliably serve our customers.\n\nA  major  disruption  could  result  in  a  significant  decrease  in  revenues, additional  costs  to  repair  assets,  and  an  adverse  impact  on  the  cost  and availability of insurance, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## A  cybersecurity  incident  or  security  breach  could  have  a  material effect on our business.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  that  requires  the  continued  operation  of sophisticated information technology, control systems  and  network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect,  use,  disclose,  store,  dispose  of  and  otherwise  process  sensitive information,  including  Company  data,  customer  energy  usage  data,  and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.\n\nXcel  Energy's  generation,  transmission,  distribution  and  fuel  storage facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure  or physical  assets  as  well  as  information  processed  in  our  systems  (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and  assets)  could  be  affected  by  cybersecurity  incidents,  including  those caused by human error.\n\nThe  utility  industry  has  been  the  target  of  several  attacks  on  operational systems  and  has  seen  an  increased  volume  and  sophistication  of cybersecurity  incidents  from  international  activist  organizations,  other countries and individuals. We expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise  our  information  technology  and  control  systems,  network infrastructure and other assets. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations.",

        "page_content": "Cybersecurity  incidents  could  harm  our  businesses  by  limiting  our generation, transmission and  distribution capabilities, delaying our development  and  construction  of  new  facilities  or  capital  improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.\n\nXcel Energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cybersecurity incident on the regional electric transmission grid, natural  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources  of  our  third-party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business.\n\nGenerative  Artificial  Intelligence,  such  as  large  language  models  like ChatGPT, present a range of challenges and potential risks as we consider impacts  to  the  business.  These  challenges  involve  navigating  the complexities  of  creating  and  deploying  AI  models  that  generate  content autonomously.  Data  privacy,  legal  concerns,  and  security  issues  are  all risks as this technology continues to be adopted.\n\nOur  supply  chain  for  procurement  of  digital  equipment  and  services  may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant  costs  of  remediation.  We  are  unable  to  quantify  the  potential impact of cybersecurity threats or subsequent related actions. Cybersecurity  incidents  and  regulatory  action  could  result  in  a  material decrease  in  revenues  and  may  cause significant  additional  costs  (e.g., penalties,  third-party  claims,  repairs,  insurance  or  compliance)  and potentially  disrupt  our  supply  and  markets  for  natural  gas,  oil  and  other fuels.\n\nWe maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control  systems,  network  infrastructure  and  other  assets.  However,  these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents,  including  asset  failure  or  unauthorized  access  to  assets  or information.\n\nA  failure  or  breach  of  our  technology  systems  or  those  of  our  third-party service  providers  could  disrupt  critical  business  functions  and  may negatively  impact  our  business,  our  brand,  and  our  reputation.  The cybersecurity threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize  network  protection  may  not  be  effective  given  the  constant changes to threat vulnerability.\n\nWhile  the  Company  maintains  insurance  relating  to  cybersecurity  events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to  offset  any  losses,  costs  or  damages  experienced.  Also,  the  market  for cybersecurity  insurance  is  relatively  new  and  coverage  available  for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.\n\nOur electric  and  natural  gas  utility  businesses  are  seasonal  and  weather patterns  can  have  a  material  impact  on  our  operating  performance. Demand for electricity  is  often  greater  in  the  summer  and  winter  months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather  patterns.  A  significant  amount  of  natural  gas  revenues  are recognized  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  related  to  the  heating  season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Unusually  mild  winters  and  summers  could  have  an  adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Public Policy Risks\n\n## Increased  risks  of  regulatory  penalties  could  negatively  impact  our business.\n\nThe  Energy  Act  increased  civil  penalty  authority  for  violation  of  FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC can impose penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both  electricity  and  natural  gas.  In  addition,  NERC  electric  reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. Also, the PHMSA, Occupational Safety  and  Health  Administration  and  other  federal  agencies  have  the authority to assess penalties.\n\nIn the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a serious reliability, cybersecurity or safety incident did occur, it could have a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash flows.\n\nThe continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution  have  increasingly  become  a  public  policy  advocacy target.  These  efforts  may  result  in  a  limitation  of  natural  gas  as  an energy  source  for  both  power  generation  and  heating,  which  could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. If such policies were to prevail, we may be  forced  to  make  new  resource  investment  decisions  which  could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service.\n\n## Environmental Policy Risks\n\n## We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nLegislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial  risk  as  our  facilities  may  be  subject  to  additional  regulation  at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.\n\nIn  2015,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change reached  consensus  among  190  nations  on  an  agreement  (the  Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5\u00ba Celsius.\n\nInternational commitments and agreements could result in future additional GHG reductions in the United States. In addition, in 2023 the EPA intends to  publish  draft  regulations  for  GHG  emissions  from  the  power  sector consistent with the agency's Clean Air Act authorities.\n\nMany  states  and  localities  continue  to  pursue  their  own  climate  policies. The  steps  Xcel  Energy  has  taken  to  date  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, including  energy  efficiency  measures,  adding  renewable  generation  and retiring  or  converting  coal  plants  to  natural  gas,  occurred  under  stateendorsed  resource  plans,  renewable  energy  standards  and  other  state policies.",

        "page_content": "We may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require  substantial  capital  expenditures  and  possibly  require  payment  of substantial  penalties  or  damages.  Defense  costs  associated  with  such litigation  can  also  be  significant  and  could  affect  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows  if  such  costs  are  not  recovered  through regulated rates.\n\nIf our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.\n\n## We  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  with  which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that  affect  many aspects  of  our  operations,  including  air  emissions,  water  quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes  and  hazardous  substances.  Laws  and  regulations  require  us  to obtain  permits,  licenses,  and  approvals  and  to  comply  with  a  variety  of environmental requirements.\n\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to loweremitting  facilities,  install  pollution  control  equipment,  clean  up  spills  and other  contamination  and  correct  environmental  hazards.  Failure  to  meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where  our  past  activities,  or  the  activities  of  other  parties,  caused environmental contamination.\n\nChanges in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  mandates  to  provide  customers  with  clean  energy, renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  offerings.  It  could  have  a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O&M costs incurred to comply with the requirements.\n\nIn addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new  laws  or  regulations  may  be  adopted.  We  may  also  incur  additional unanticipated  obligations  or  liabilities  under  existing  environmental  laws and regulations.\n\n## We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change  and  other  weather,  natural  disaster  and  resource  depletion impacts.\n\nClimate  change  can  create  physical  and  financial  risk.  Physical  risks include  changes  in  weather  conditions  and  extreme  weather  events.  Our customers'  energy  needs  vary  with  weather.  To  the  extent  weather conditions  are  affected  by  climate  change,  customers'  energy  use  could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require  us  to  invest  in  generating  assets,  transmission  and  infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.\n\nClimate  change  may  impact  the  economy,  which  could  impact  our  sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation  of  GHG,  could  impact  the  availability  of  goods  and  prices charged  by  our  suppliers  which  would  normally  be  borne  by  consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.\n\nTo  the  extent  financial  markets  view  climate  change  and  emissions  of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\n\nWe  establish  strategies  and  expectations  related  to  climate  change  and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are  outside  of  our  control.  Examples  of  such  factors  include,  but  are  not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions,  the  pace  of  scientific  and  technological  developments, increased  costs,  the  availability  of  requisite  financing,  and  changes  in carbon  markets.  Failures  or  delays  (whether  actual  or  perceived)  in achieving  our  strategies  or  expectations  related  to  climate  change  and other environmental  matters  could  adversely  affect  our  business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\n\nSevere weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms,  flooding,  tornadoes,  wildfires  and  snow  or  ice  storms  or extreme temperatures (high heating/cooling days) occur. Extreme weather conditions  in  general  require  system  backup  and  can  contribute  to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Extreme weather conditions  creating  high  energy  demand  may  raise  electricity  prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers.\n\nTo  the  extent  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  increases,  this could  increase  our  cost  of  providing  service  and  result  in  more  frequent service  interruptions.  Periods  of  extreme  temperatures  could  also  impact our ability to meet demand.\n\nMore frequent and severe drought conditions,  extreme  swings  in  amount and  timing  of  precipitation,  changes  in  vegetation,  unseasonably  warm temperatures,  very  low  humidity,  stronger  winds  and  other  factors  have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the potential impact of an event.  Also,  the  expansion  of  the  wildland  urban  interface  increases  the wildfire  risk  to  surrounding  communities  and  Xcel  Energy's  electric  and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nOther  potential  risks  associated  with  wildfires  and  other  climate  events include  the  inability  to  secure  sufficient  insurance  coverage,  or  increased costs of insurance, regulatory recovery risk, and the potential for a credit downgrade and subsequent additional costs to access capital markets.\n\nWhile we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if Xcel Energy was  found  to  be  liable  for  wildfire  damages,  amounts  that  potentially exceed  our  coverage  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nDrought  or  water  depletion  could  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  provide electricity  to  customers,  cause  early  retirement  of  power  plants  and increase  the  cost  for  energy.  Adverse  events  may  result  in  increased insurance  costs  and/or  decreased  insurance  availability.  We  may  not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\n\n## ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.",

        "page_content": "## ITEM 1C - CYBERSECURITY\n\nAs  described  in  Item  1A  -  Risk  Factors,  Xcel  Energy  operates  in  an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology,  control  systems  and  network  infrastructure,  as  such,  our business is subject to the risk of interruption by cybersecurity incidents that range  from  attacks  common  to  most  industries,  such  as  phishing  and denial-of-service, to attacks from more sophisticated adversaries, including nation  state  actors,  that  target  the  critical  infrastructure  used  in  the operation of our business.\n\nThe  Company  has  a  security  risk  program  in  place  to  identify,  assess, manage and report material risks from cybersecurity incidents. As a utility provider, Xcel Energy complies with reliability standards imposed by NERC, including  critical infrastructure protection  standards  related  to  both cybersecurity and physical security. These standards imposed by NERC, in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, are the basis for which Xcel  Energy  has  designed  the  cybersecurity  control  framework  within  its security risk program.\n\nAnnually,  as  part  of  Xcel  Energy's  enterprise  risk  program,  an  integrated cybersecurity risk identification and assessment is completed across Xcel Energy's business, including generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage  facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure or  physical  assets  as  well  as  information  processed  in  our  systems (including  systems  hosted  by  third  parties)  that  could  be  affected  by cybersecurity  incidents.  This  analysis  includes  the  impact,  likelihood, timeframe and controllability of cybersecurity risks and is presented to the Board of Directors. Management monitors and reviews the results of this analysis,  integrating  them  into  the  enterprise  risk  assessment  processes and implements appropriate mitigating actions as needed.\n\nXcel  Energy's  cybersecurity  policies,  standards,  practices  and  readiness are  regularly  assessed  by  third-party  consultants.  These  partners  are engaged  to  perform  independent  penetration  testing  and  other  security related services to assist in the prevention, detection, monitoring, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents and risks. The results of these assessments  are  communicated  to  management  and  the  Board  of Directors by the Chief Security Officer.\n\nXcel Energy employs a comprehensive risk based approach to assess the magnitude  and  significance  of  a  vendor's  risk  to  the  Company.  Certain third-party service providers are subject to vendor security risk assessments  at  the  time  of  integration,  contract  execution/renewal,  and upon detection of any increase in risk profile. Xcel Energy uses a variety of inputs  in  such  risk  assessments,  including  information  supplied  by providers  and  third  parties  (including  information  analysis  centers  that share daily threat intelligence and improve organizational agility associated with management of cybersecurity risks). In addition, the Company requires certain third-party service providers to meet  appropriate security requirements, controls and responsibilities. The Company deploys periodic monitoring  activities  to  assess  compliance  with  our  cybersecurity  control framework and investigates security incidents that have impacted our thirdparty service providers as appropriate.\n\nManagement has  assigned  responsibility  for  the  security  risk  program  to the  Chief  Security  Officer  who  has  extensive  experience  in  critical infrastructure  protection,  including  multiple  years  of  experience  with  the Department of Defense. The Chief Security Officer is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation efforts through a team  of  security  professionals,  many  of  whom  are  Certified  Information Systems Security Professionals, Certified Information Security Managers or have  received  other  cybersecurity  certifications.  The  team  has  extensive experience selecting, deploying and operating cybersecurity technologies, initiatives and processes that aid in preventing, remediating and mitigating known and unknown cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer or members of management brief the Board on routine  and  regular  cybersecurity  risk  and  threat  updates,  typically  on  a quarterly basis. In the event of a significant threat or incident, management and  the  Chief  Security  Officer  leverage  Xcel  Energy's  incident  response processes  to  assess  impacts  and  resolve  incidents.  When  a  significant cybersecurity incident occurs, management communicates with the Board of Directors and relevant committees.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  oversees  the  risks  associated  with  cybersecurity and  the  physical  security  of  our  assets,  with  information  security  matters being discussed at each regular board meeting as well as at the ONES and Audit Committee meetings throughout the year.\n\nWhile  the  ONES  Committee  has  primary  committee  responsibility  for cybersecurity due to the operational issues involved, the Board of Directors has  determined  that  the  topic  is  of  sufficient  importance  to  warrant  this comprehensive oversight approach. Augmenting such oversight efforts, the Board  of  Directors  conducts  drills  to  practice  its  response  in  a  possible emergency situation to ensure it is well prepared and positioned to perform in a possible crisis.\n\nCybersecurity risks are a part of Xcel Energy's normal course of business. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. As of Feb. 21, 2024 there have been no material cybersecurity incidents to report.",

The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable estimation.\n\nManagement  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an  amount  or  range  of  a reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations,  including  but  not  limited  to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\n\nFor current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on  Xcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Legal  fees  are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Item 1 and Item 7 for further information.\n\n## ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNone.\n\n## PART II\n\n## ITEM  5  -  MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\n\n## Stock Data\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  common  stock  is  listed  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select Market  (Nasdaq).

        "page_content": "## Purchases of Equity Securities by Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\n\nFor  the  quarter  ended  Dec.  31,  2023,  no  equity  securities  that  are registered  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  pursuant  to  Section  12  of  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were purchased by or on behalf of us or any of our affiliated purchasers.\n\n## ITEM 6 - [RESERVED]\n\n## ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe  following  discussion  includes  financial  information  prepared  in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such  as  ongoing  ROE,  ongoing  earnings  and  ongoing  diluted  EPS. Generally,  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  a  measure  of  a  company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that is adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  uses  non-GAAP  measures  for  financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining  performance-based  compensation  and  communicating  its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are  intended  to  supplement  investors'  understanding  of  our  performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in  accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures.\n\n## Ongoing ROE\n\nOngoing  ROE  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's  average  stockholder's  equity.  We  use  these  non-GAAP  financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.\n\n## Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\n\nGAAP  diluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents)  were  settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.'s diluted EPS is  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Ongoing  earnings  reflect adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  (net  income)  for  certain  items.  Ongoing diluted  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel  Energy  Inc.  common  shares  outstanding  for  the  period.  Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  evaluate  and  provide details  of  Xcel  Energy's  core  earnings  and  underlying  performance.  For instance,  to  present  ongoing  earnings  and  ongoing  diluted  earnings  per share, we may adjust the related GAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring  in  nature.  We  believe  these  measurements  are  useful  to investors  to  evaluate  the  actual  and  projected  financial  performance  and contribution  of  our  subsidiaries.  These  non-GAAP  financial  measures should  not  be  considered  as  an  alternative  to  measures  calculated  and reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (net income) to ongoing earnings:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)              | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| GAAP net income                    | $  1,771 | $  1,736 |\n| Loss on Comanche Unit 3 litigation | 35       | -        |\n| Workforce reduction expenses       | 72       | -        |\n| Less: tax effect of adjustments    | (27)     | -        |\n| Ongoing earnings                   | $  1,851 | $  1,736 |\n\n|                                                 | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023   | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023   | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss)  Per Share              | GAAP Diluted  EPS                   | Impact of  Adjustments              | Ongoing  Diluted EPS                |\n| NSP-Minnesota                                   | $  1.28                             | $  0.04                             | $  1.32                             |\n| PSCo  (a)                                       | 1.26                                | 0.08                                | 1.33                                |\n| SPS                                             | 0.70                                | 0.01                                | 0.71                                |\n| NSP-Wisconsin                                   | 0.25                                | -                                   | 0.25                                |\n| Earnings from equity method  investments - WYCO | 0.04                                | -                                   | 0.04                                |\n| Regulated utility  (a)                          | 3.52                                | 0.14                                | 3.66                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. and Other                      | (0.31)                              | -                                   | (0.31)                              |\n| Total  (a)                                      | $  3.21                             | 0.14                                | $  3.35                             |\n\n|                                                 | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2022   | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2022   | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss)  Per Share              | GAAP Diluted  EPS                   | Impact of  Adjustments              | Ongoing  Diluted EPS                |\n| NSP-Minnesota                                   | $  1.23                             | $  -                                | $  1.23                             |\n| PSCo                                            | 1.33                                | -                                   | 1.33                                |\n| SPS                                             | 0.64                                | -                                   | 0.64                                |\n| NSP-Wisconsin                                   | 0.23                                | -                                   | 0.23                                |\n| Earnings from equity method  investments - WYCO | 0.04                                | -                                   | 0.04                                |\n| Regulated utility  (a)                          | 3.47                                | -                                   | 3.47                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. and Other                      | (0.29)                              | -                                   | (0.29)                              |\n| Total  (a)                                      | $  3.17                             | -                                   | $  3.17                             |\n\nComanche  Unit  3  Litigation -In  the  third  quarter  of  2023,  PSCo recognized a $34 million loss due to a jury verdict in Denver County District Court awarding CORE lost power damages and other costs.

In  addition,  Xcel  Energy's  management  uses  ongoing  earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n\n## 2023 Comparison with 2022\n\nXcel Energy - GAAP diluted earnings were $3.21 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022 and ongoing diluted earnings were $3.35 per share in 2023, compared with $3.17 per share in 2022. The increase in ongoing earnings  per  share  was  driven  by  increased  recovery  of  infrastructure investments, higher sales and demand and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and interest charges and unfavorable weather.\n\nFluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in  fuel  and  purchased  power  and/or  natural  gas  sold  and  transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues).\n\nNSP-Minnesota - GAAP earnings increased $0.05 per share and ongoing earnings  increased  $0.09  per  share  for  2023  compared  to  2022.  The change to ongoing earnings was driven by increased recovery of electric infrastructure investments, partially offset by increased interest charges and unfavorable weather.\n\nPSCo - GAAP earnings decreased $0.07 per share and ongoing earnings was  flat  for  2023  compared  to  2022.  Ongoing  earnings  primarily  reflects higher  recovery  of  infrastructure  investment  and  lower  O&M  expenses, which were partially offset by increased depreciation, interest charges and unfavorable weather.\n\nSPS - GAAP earnings increased $0.06 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.07 per share for 2023 compared to 2022. Ongoing earnings were largely impacted by regulatory rate outcomes, sales growth, partially offset by increased depreciation, interest charges and unfavorable weather.\n\nNSP-Wisconsin -  GAAP  and  ongoing  earnings  increased  $0.02  per share for 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily  a  result  of  higher  recovery  of  electric  infrastructure  investment, partially  offset  by  unfavorable  weather  and,  higher  depreciation,  O&M expenses and interest charges.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.  and  Other -  Primarily  includes  financing  costs  and interest income at the holding company and earnings from EIP funds equity method investments. Fluctuations from 2022 levels were largely attributable to increased interest rates.\n\n## Changes in Diluted EPS\n\nComponents significantly contributing to changes in EPS:\n\n| 2023 vs. 2022                                                                         |         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share                                                     | Dec. 31 |\n| GAAP and ongoing diluted EPS - 2022                                                   | $  3.17 |\n| Components of change - 2023 vs. 2022                                                  |         |\n| Higher electric revenues, net of electric fuel and purchased power                    | 0.07    |\n| Lower O&M expenses                                                                    | 0.06    |\n| Lower conservation and demand side management expenses (offset  in electric revenues) | 0.06    |\n| Higher other income (expense)                                                         | 0.05    |\n| Lower taxes (other than income taxes)                                                 | 0.04    |\n| Higher natural gas revenues, net of cost of natural gas sold and  transported         | 0.03    |\n| Higher interest expense                                                               | (0.14)  |\n| Higher depreciation and amortization                                                  | (0.05)  |\n| Workforce reduction expenses                                                          | (0.09)  |\n| Loss on Comanche Unit 3 litigation                                                    | (0.05)  |\n| Other (net)                                                                           | 0.06    |\n| GAAP diluted EPS - 2023                                                               | $  3.21 |\n| Workforce reduction expenses                                                          | 0.09    |\n| Loss on Comanche Unit 3 litigation                                                    | 0.05    |\n| Ongoing diluted EPS - 2023                                                            | $  3.35 |\n\nROE for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries:\n\n|                     | 2023     | 2023        | 2022                  |\n|---------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| ROE                 | GAAP ROE | Ongoing ROE | GAAP and  Ongoing ROE |\n| NSP-Minnesota       | 8.82 %   | 9.11 %      | 8.76 %                |\n| PSCo                | 7.32     | 7.77        | 8.23                  |\n| SPS                 | 9.80     | 9.98        | 9.36                  |\n| NSP-Wisconsin       | 10.38    | 10.67       | 10.57                 |\n| Operating Companies | 8.45     | 8.79        | 8.74                  |\n| Xcel Energy         | 10.33    | 10.79       | 10.76                 |\n\n## Statement of Income Analysis\n\nThe  following  summarizes  the  items  that  affected  the  individual  revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings -Unusually  hot  summers  or  cold  winters  increase  electric  and  natural  gas sales,  while  mild  weather  reduces  electric  and  natural  gas  sales.  The estimated  impact  of  weather  on  earnings  is  based  on  the  number  of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related  operating  expenses  that  could  result  due  to  storm  activity  or vegetation management requirements.\n\nAs a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance.  However,  electric  decoupling  mechanisms  in Colorado (mechanism expired in September 2023) and electric sales trueup mechanisms in Minnesota and gas decoupling mechanism in Minnesota predominately  mitigate  the  positive  and  adverse  impacts  of  weather  in those jurisdictions.",

        "page_content": "Degree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain  comfortable  indoor  temperature  levels  based  on  each  day's average temperature and humidity.\n\nHDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. CDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nEach degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD.\n\nIn Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely  to  impact  the  usage  of  Xcel  Energy's  residential  and  commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\n\nNormal  weather  conditions  are  defined  as  either  the  10,  20  or  30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory  practice.  To  calculate  the  impact  of  weather  on  demand,  a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations,  windchill  and  cloud  cover  may  not  be  reflected  in  weathernormalized estimates.\n\nPercentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI:\n\n|     | 2023 vs. Normal   | 2022 vs. Normal   | 2023 vs.  2022   |\n|-----|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| HDD | (7.3) %           | 6.5 %             | (12.9) %         |\n| CDD | 5.2               | 23.7              | (13.8)           |\n| THI | 16.0              | 5.6               | 9                |\n\nWeather - Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:\n\n|                              | 2023 vs.  Normal   | 2022 vs.  Normal   | 2023 vs.  2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Retail electric              | $  0.013           | $  0.138           | $  (0.125)       |\n| Decoupling and sales true-up | (0.007)            | (0.061)            | 0.054            |\n| Electric total               | $  0.006           | $  0.077           | $  (0.071)       |\n| Firm natural gas             | (0.010)            | 0.037              | (0.047)          |\n| Decoupling                   | $  0.013           | $  -               | $  0.013         |\n| Gas total                    | $  0.003           | $  0.037           | $  (0.034)       |\n| Total                        | $  0.009           | $  0.114           | $  (0.105)       |\n\nSales - Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales:\n\n|                              | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | NSP- Minnesota  | PSCo            | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Actual                       |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | (0.5) %         | (4.0) %         | (3.0) %         | (2.6) %         | (2.3) %         |\n| Electric C&I                 | (1.1)           | (1.9)           | 5.2             | (0.5)           | 0.5             |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (0.9)           | (2.6)           | 3.6             | (1.1)           | (0.3)           |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | (12.0)          | (1.5)           | N/A             | (12.6)          | (5.7)           |\n\n|                              | 2023 vs. 2022      | 2023 vs. 2022      | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   | 2023 vs. 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | NSP- Minnesota     | PSCo               | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Weather-normalized           | Weather-normalized | Weather-normalized |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | 1.0 %              | 1.6 %              | 1.1 %           | 0.1 %           | 1.2 %           |\n| Electric C&I                 | (1.1)              | (0.4)              | 5.3             | (0.4)           | 1.0             |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (0.4)              | 0.3                | 4.5             | (0.3)           | 1.0             |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | -                  | 2.3                | N/A             | (0.4)           | 1.4             |\n\n## Annual weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline)\n\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota - Residential sales increased due to a 1.2% increase in  customers outpacing declines in use per customer. The decline in C&I  sales  was  due  to  lower  use  per  customer,  particularly  due  to weakness in the manufacturing sector compared to prior year.\n- \u00b7 PSCo  -  Residential  sales  increased  due  to  increased  use  per customer and a 1.3% increase in customers. The decline in C&I sales was  attributable  to  decreased  use  per  customer,  primarily  in  the manufacturing sector.\n- \u00b7 SPS - Residential sales growth was primarily attributable to a 0.7% increase  in  customers  and  increased  use  per  customer.  C&I  sales increased  due  to  higher  use  per  customer,  primarily  driven  by  the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Wisconsin - The C&I sales decline was associated with lower use  per  customer,  experienced  primarily  in  the  transportation  and manufacturing sectors.\n\n## Annual weather-normalized natural gas sales growth (decline)\n\n- \u00b7 Natural  gas  sales  reflect  1.2%  residential  and  0.7%  C&I  customer growth  and  an  increase  in  C&I  use  per  customer  at  PSCo.  Partially offsetting these increases were lower use per residential customer in all jurisdictions.\n\n## Electric Margin\n\nElectric  margin  is  presented  as  electric  revenues  less  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  expenses.  Expenses  incurred  for  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  are  generally  recovered  through  various  regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs  a  result,  changes  in  these  expenses  are  generally  offset  in  operating revenues.\n\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations  in  the  price  of  natural  gas,  coal  and  uranium.  These  price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery  mechanisms.  In  addition,  electric  customers  receive  a  credit  for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.\n\n## Electric Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power and Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Electric revenues                 | $  11,446 | $  12,123 |\n| Electric fuel and purchased power | (4,278)   | (5,005)   |\n| Electric margin                   | $  7,168  | $  7,118  |",

Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas  sold  are  generally  recovered  through  various  regulatory  recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.\n\nNatural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. However,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  natural  gas  generally  have  minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms.\n\n## Natural Gas Revenues, Cost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported and Natural Gas Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                    | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Natural gas revenues                     | $  2,645 | $  3,080 |\n| Cost of natural gas sold and transported | (1,456)  | (1,910)  |\n| Natural gas margin                       | $  1,189 | $  1,170 |\n\n## Change in Natural Gas Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                           | 2023 vs. 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Regulatory rate outcomes (CO, WI, MI)           | $  50           |\n| Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling) | (25)            |\n| Other (net)                                     | (6)             |\n| Total increase                                  | $  19           |\n\n## Non-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items\n\nO&M  Expenses -  O&M  expenses  decreased  $47  million  in  2023, primarily  due  to  the  impact  of  management  cost  containment  efforts,  the exit of our appliance repair services business and the change in deferred costs  associated  with  the  Texas  Electric  Rate  Cases  (offset  in  Electric revenues),  offset  by  higher  bad  debt  expenses,  the  impact  of  inflationary pressures,  including  labor,  and  timing  of  unplanned  maintenance  at generating plants.\n\nDepreciation  and  Amortization -Depreciation and  amortization increased $35 million for the year, primarily related to system expansion, offset  by  the  change in  deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case and depreciation life extensions implemented in the Minnesota Electric Rate Case.\n\nTaxes  (other  than  Income  Taxes) -Taxes  (other  than  income  taxes) decreased $31 million in 2023, primarily due to lower property tax expense (lower tax rates in Minnesota offset by increase in Colorado) and deferrals related to the Minnesota Electric Rate Case and Texas Electric Rate Case.\n\nOther Income (Expense) -Other income (expense) increased $35 million for the year, primarily related to rabbi trust performance, which is primarily offset in employee benefit cost in O&M expenses.\n\nInterest Charges -Interest charges increased $102 million in 2023. The increase  was  largely  due  to  higher  long-term  debt  levels  to  fund  capital investments and higher interest rates.\n\n## Xcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\n\nNet  income  and  diluted  EPS  contributions  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its nonregulated businesses:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                    | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (174) | $  (153) |\n| Venture Holdings  (a)                    | 3        | 5        |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (2)      | (12)     |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (173) | $  (160) |\n\n| (Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share)      | 2023      | 2022      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (0.32) | $  (0.28) |\n| Venture Holdings  (a)                    | 0.01      | 0.01      |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | -         | (0.02)    |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (0.31) | $  (0.29) |\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  results  include  interest  charges,  which  are  incurred  at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\n\n## 2022 Comparison with 2021\n\nA discussion of changes in Xcel Energy's results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended Dec. 31, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, 'Item 7, Management's Discussion and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  of  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2022, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 23, 2023.

The rate request was based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and forward test years. In December 2021, the MPUC approved interim rates, subject  to  refund,  of $247  million,  effective  Jan.  1,  2022.  In  November  2022,  NSP-Minnesota revised its rate request to $498 million over three years.\n\nIn July  2023,  the  MPUC  approved  a  three-year  rate  increase  of approximately $332 million for 2022-2024, based on a ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The MPUC also approved a continuation of the sales true-up mechanism.\n\n- In October  2023,  the  MPUC  denied  NSP-Minnesota's  request  for reconsideration of certain aspects of the decision. NSP-Minnesota filed an appeal  of  the  decision  to  the  Minnesota  Court  of  Appeals  in  November 2023.\n\n2024  Minnesota  Natural  Gas  Rate  Case -  In  November  2023,  NSPMinnesota  filed  a  request  with  the  MPUC  for  an  annual  natural  gas  rate increase of approximately $59 million, or 9.6%. The request is based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forward test year with rate base  of  approximately  $1.27  billion.  In  Dec.  2023,  the  MPUC  approved NSP-Minnesota's  request  for  interim  rates,  subject  to refund, of approximately $51 million (implemented on Jan. 1, 2024).\n\nNext steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Intervenor direct testimony: April 19, 2024\n- \u00b7 Rebuttal testimony: May 24, 2024\n- \u00b7 Evidentiary hearings: July 10-12, 2024\n- \u00b7 ALJ Report: October 28, 2024\n- \u00b7 MPUC Order Due: March 14, 2025",

        "page_content": "2024 North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case -  In  December  2023,  NSPMinnesota filed a request with the NDPSC for an annual natural gas rate increase of approximately $8 million, or 9.4%. The filing is based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forecast test year with rate base of  approximately  $168  million.  NSP-Minnesota  requested  interim  rates, subject to refund, of approximately $8 million to be implemented on March 1, 2024.\n\n## Nuclear Power Operations\n\nNuclear  power  plant  operations  produce  gaseous,  liquid  and  solid radioactive  wastes,  which  are  covered  by  federal  regulation.  High-level radioactive  wastes  primarily  include  used  nuclear  fuel.  Low-level  waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.\n\nNRC  Regulation -  The  NRC  regulates  nuclear  operations.  Costs  of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.\n\nLow-Level  Waste  Disposal -  Low  level  waste  from  Monticello  and  PI  is disposed  of  at  the  Clive  facility  located  in  Utah  and  the  Waste  Control Specialists facility in Texas. NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site  at  PI  and  Monticello  which  would  allow  both  plants  to  continue  to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.\n\nHigh-Level  Radioactive  Waste  Disposal -  The  federal  government  has responsibility  to  permanently  dispose  of  domestic  spent  nuclear  fuel  and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE  to  implement  a  program  for  nuclear  high-level  waste management.\n\nThis  includes  the  siting,  licensing,  construction  and  operation  of  a repository  for  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  civilian  nuclear  power  reactors  and other  high-level  radioactive  wastes  at  a  permanent  federal  storage  or disposal  facility.  Currently,  there  are  no  definitive  plans  for  a  permanent federal storage facility site.\n\nNuclear Spent Fuel Storage - NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  its  Monticello  and  PI  nuclear  generating  plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until the end of the current operating licenses in 2030 for Monticello, 2033 for PI Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2.\n\nIn  February  2023,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  a  CON  with  the  MPUC  for additional storage at PI to support possible life extension to 2054.\n\nIn  October  2023,  the  MPUC issued an order approving NSP-Minnesota's application  for a CON  for  additional  spent  fuel  storage  (existing Independent  Spent  Fuel  Storage  Installation)  at  the  Monticello  Nuclear Power Generating Plant to allow continued operation of the Monticello Plant until 2040.\n\nAuthorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not commence storage operations.\n\n## NSP-Wisconsin\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO               | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PSCW                                | gas operations.

Under  Wisconsin  rules,  utilities  submit  a  forward-looking  annual  fuel  cost  plan  to  the  PSCW.  Once  the  PSCW approves the plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel  cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2% annual  tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a  fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of  deferred  costs  is  determined  by  the  PSCW.  Rate  recovery  of  deferred  fuel  cost  is  subject  to  an  earnings  test  based  on  the  most recently authorized ROE. Under-collections that exceed the  2%  annual  tolerance  band  may  not  be  recovered  if  the  utility  earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.

In  May  2023,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  a  recommended  portfolio,  which proposed an additional  250  MW of  self-build  solar  generation  at  the site of our retiring Sherco coal units and a 100 MW solar PPA located in  Wisconsin  as  part  of  the  resource  plan  RFP.  In  September  2023, the  MPUC approved the request for 350 MW, subject to a cost cap based on projected costs for the Sherco solar project.\n- \u00b7 In  the  second  quarter  of  2023,  NSP-Minnesota  initiated  the  process with  the  MPUC  for  acquisition  of  800  MW  of  firm  dispatchable resources.  In  January  2024,  NSP-Minnesota  and  other  companies submitted proposed resources. NSP-Minnesota expects a decision by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n- \u00b7 In  July  2023,  NSP-Wisconsin  issued  an  RFP  seeking  approximately 650 MW of solar and/or solar  plus  storage  development  assets  that will be developed in the 2027-2029 timeframe to replace the capacity from  the  retiring  King  Generating  Station.  The  RFP  closed  in September 2023 and bids are being evaluated.\n- \u00b7 In October 2023, NSP-Minnesota issued an RFP seeking approximately  1,200  MW  of  wind  development  assets  to  replace capacity and reutilize interconnection rights associated with the retiring Sherco  coal  facilities.  The  RFP  closed  in  December  2023  and  the NSP-Minnesota expects to file for approval of recommended projects by mid-2024.\n\n2024  Upper  Midwest  Energy  Plan  In  February  2024,  NSP-Minnesota filed its resource plan with the MPUC. Key components of the plan include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduced carbon emissions by more than 80%, potentially up to 88%, by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Extends the operation of Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants through the early 2050s.\n- \u00b7 Adds 3,600 MW of new wind and solar resources by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Adds 600 MW of battery energy storage by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Adds more than 2,200 MW of dispatchable resources by 2030.\n\nNSP-Minnesota anticipates a MPUC decision in 2025.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Services\n\nThe  NSP  System  expects  to  use  power  plants,  power  purchases, conservation and DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - Through the Interchange Agreement, NSP-Wisconsin receives  power  purchased  by  NSP-Minnesota  from  other  utilities  and independent  power  producers.  Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity charge and an energy charge.  NSP-Minnesota  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet  system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nNSP-Minnesota  conducts  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy-related  products.  NSP-Minnesota  uses  physical  and  financial instruments  to  minimize  commodity  price  risk  and  to  hedge  sales  and purchases.\n\nNSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities.  Sharing  of  any  margins  is  determined  through  state  regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.

The  total  request reflected a $303 million increase, which includes $50 million of authorized costs previously recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request was based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.7% and a 2023 forecast test year with a 2023 average rate base of $11.3 billion.\n\nIn September 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement between PSCo and various parties, which included the following terms:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail  revenue  increase  (excluding  rider  roll-ins)  of  $95  million (2.96%), based on a 2022 historic test year using year-end rate base with forward looking known and measurable adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Weighted-average cost of capital of 6.95% (based on 55.69% equity ratio and 9.3% ROE).\n- \u00b7 Termination of the revenue decoupling pilot.\n- \u00b7 Continuation of previously authorized trackers and deferrals.\n\nRates became effective in September 2023.\n\nColorado  Resource  Plan -  In  August  2022,  the  CPUC  approved  a settlement for the Colorado Resource Plan, which provides for an expected carbon reduction and the retirement of PSCo's remaining coal plant by the end of 2030.\n\nIn September  2023  (updated  in  October  2023),  PSCo  filed  its recommended Preferred Portfolio of resources, which proposed a total of 7,521 MW of generation resources, including 4,716 owned MW and 2,805 purchased  power  MW.  The  filing  also  included  several  other  alternative portfolios.\n\nIn  December  2023,  the  CPUC  approved  an  alternative  portfolio  of  5,835 MW. The decision provides an opportunity to assess timing and levels of incremental renewable resources in the Just Transition Plan filing expected to be submitted by June 1, 2024.\n\n## Approved portfolio includes the following resources:\n\n| Generation Resource (in MW)   | Company Owned   | PPAs   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------|---------|\n| Wind Resources                | 1,325           | 375    | 1,700   |\n| Solar                         | 858             | 760    | 1,618   |\n| Storage                       | 500             | 1,348  | 1,848   |\n| Natural Gas                   | 450             | 219    | 669     |\n| Total                         | 3,133           | 2,702  | 5,835   |\n\nPSCo expects to invest approximately $4.8 billion in generation resources under the alternative portfolio for the benefit of its customers and achieving the state's clean energy goals. The CPUC did not approve the May Valley to Longhorn Transmission Line, which was estimated at $250 million.\n\nIn  December  2023,  the  CPUC  approved  two  PIMs  associated  with  the generation  projects  in  the  portfolio,  including  a  two-way  sharing  measure related  to  capital  construction  costs  and  another  related  to  ongoing levelized  energy  costs.  These  PIMs  will  be  further  defined  in  the  written order and related proceedings throughout 2024.\n\nIn  February  2024,  PSCo filed  an  ARRR to seek approval for an updated portfolio, reflecting inclusion of certain back-up bids and clarifications of the application of PIMs.\n\nColorado Natural Gas Rate Case In January 2024, PSCo filed a request with  the  CPUC  seeking  an  increase  to  retail  natural  gas  rates  of  $171 million,  or  an  approximately  9.5%  increase  in  the  average  residential customer bill. The request is based on a 2023 test year, a 10.25% ROE, an equity  ratio  of  55%  and  a  $4.2  billion  retail  rate  base  which  includes projected capital additions through Dec. 31, 2023. PSCo has requested a proposed effective date of Nov. 1, 2024.\n\nPSCo has proposed to defer collection of the increased rates until Feb. 15, 2025 (following the expiration of the rider to recover Winter Storm Uri costs) to  mitigate  customer  bill  impacts,  with  revenues  for  the  deferred  period collected over a 12-month period beginning on that date.\n\nThe  request  supports  fundamental  infrastructure  investments  to  serve customers,  consistent  with  PSCo's  obligation  to  provide  safe,  reliable service while enabling PSCo to continue to be a leader of the clean energy transition in partnership with the CPUC to achieve clean heat goals.\n\n|                                                             | Revenue Request (millions of dollars)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Changes since 2022 rate case:                               |                                         |\n| Plant related investments  (a)                              | $  145                                  |\n| Operations and maintenance, amortization and other expenses | 23                                      |\n| Property tax expense                                        | 10                                      |\n| Sales growth                                                | (7)                                     |\n| Total base revenue request                                  | $  171                                  |\n\nECA  Fuel  Recovery  In  December  2022,  PSCo  filed  to  recover  $123 million of under-recovered 2022 fuel costs over two quarters. In December 2022, the CPUC found that the $123 million should be removed from the proposed ECA rates, and required PSCo to file a separate application to recover these costs.\n\nIn 2023, PSCo submitted interim ECA filings to recover $70 million and $25 million, respectively, of the 2022 under-recovered costs.",

        "page_content": "In  the  third  quarter,  PSCo  and  CPUC Staff filed a settlement allowing for collection of the remaining amount, which after final adjustments was $37 million.  In  December  2023,  the  ALJ  issued  a  recommended  decision approving the settlement in full. Recovery of costs is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nColorado Legislation - In May 2023, Colorado Senate Bill 23-291 passed and  was  signed  into  law.  The  bill  includes  a  number  of  topics  including natural  gas  and  electric  fuel  incentive  mechanisms,  natural  gas  planning rules, regulatory filing requirements, and non-recovery of certain expenses (e.g., certain organizational or membership dues, tax penalties or fines).\n\nIn  November  2023,  the  CPUC  approved  PSCo's  natural  gas  price  risk management plan, establishing upper and lower limits for changes in the GCA rate. As a result costs above the upper limit are deferred for future recovery,  with  interest,  and  costs  below  the  lower  limit  are  deferred  as  a reserve against future cost increases.\n\nThe legislation also calls for the CPUC to adopt rules to establish fuel cost mechanisms to align the financial incentives of a utility with the interests of the  utility's  customers  by  Jan.  1,  2025.  The  CPUC  issued  a  request  for initial comments on a potential mechanism under which gas utilities would share a percentage, subject to an annual cap, of cost changes in the GCA. A formal rulemaking is expected to commence in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Service Providers\n\nPSCo meets its system capacity and energy requirements through its fleet of owned and purchased electric generation resources and, when required, the use of demand-side management programs.\n\nPurchased  Power -  PSCo  purchases  power  from  other  utilities,  energy marketers and independent power producers. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. Much of PSCo's long-term purchased power is for wind, solar and storage resources. PSCo makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation out of service for maintenance,  meet  operating  reserve  obligations,  or  obtain  energy  at  a lower cost.\n\nEnergy  Markets -  PSCo  joined  the  SPP  Western  Energy  Imbalance Service  Market  in  April  2023.  This  market  is  an  incremental  step  in  the participation in an organized wholesale market. Energy imbalance markets allow  participants  to  buy  and  sell  power  close  to  the  time  electricity  is consumed  and  gives  system  operators  real-time visibility across neighboring grids. The result improves balancing supply and demand at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  In  addition  to  using  its  own transmission  system,  PSCo  has  contracts  with  regional  transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nPSCo  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities.\n\nSharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\n\n## SPS\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                               | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PUCT                                                | Retail  electric  operations,  rates,  services,  construction  of  transmission  or  generation  and  other  aspects  of  SPS'  electric  operations.

The request was based on a ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% and rate base of $3.6 billion. SPS requested a surcharge from July 13, 2023 through the effective date of new base rates.\n\nIn  December  2023,  SPS,  PUCT  Staff  and  intervenors  filed  a  black  box settlement. Key terms include:\n\n- \u00b7 A base rate increase of $65 million effective back to July 13, 2023.\n- \u00b7 A 9.55% ROE, a 54.51% equity ratio and a 7.11% WACC for purposes of calculating SPS' allowance for funds used during construction.\n- \u00b7 The  reflection  in  rates  of  the  retirement  of  Tolk  Generation  Station from 2034 to 2028.\n\nA PUCT decision is expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nSPS and LP&L Termination - SPS and LP&L were parties to a 25-year, 170 MW partial requirements contract serving LP&L. In May 2021, SPS and LP&L  finalized  a  settlement  which  terminated  the  contract  upon  LP&L's move from the SPP to the ERCOT. Based on the approved de-escalation clause, LP&L paid SPS $66 million in January 2024 to the benefit of SPS' remaining customers.\n\n2022 All-Source RFP - In July 2023, SPS filed for approval of CCN for a recommended  generation  portfolio,  which  includes  418  MW  of  self-build solar projects and a 36 MW battery. A decision from PUCT and NMPRC is expected in mid-2024.\n\nThe second portion of the portfolio includes a November 2023 filing for the approval of PPAs including 48 MW of battery energy storage and 230 MW of existing gas generation. Regulatory decisions on these PPA agreements are expected in Q3 2024.\n\nNew Mexico Resource Plan - In October 2023, SPS filed its IRP with the NMPRC, which supports projected load growth and secures replacement energy  and  capacity  for  retiring  resources.  Based  on  load  forecast scenarios, SPS' initial IRP modeling projects a total resource need ranging from approximately 5,300 MW to 10,200 MW by 2030. Upon acceptance of the IRP, SPS expects to issue an RFP for new generation in mid-2024. The RFP  will  be  evaluated  in  the  latter  half  of  2024  with  portfolio  selection expected in early 2025.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Providers\n\nSPS expects  to  use  electric  generating  stations,  power  purchases,  DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  typically  require  periodic  capacity and  energy  charges.  SPS  also  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  SPS  has  contractual  arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSPS  does  not  provide  retail  natural  gas  service,  but  purchases  and transports  natural  gas  for  its  generation  facilities  and  operates  limited natural  gas  pipeline  facilities  connecting  the  generation  facilities  to interstate  natural  gas  pipelines.  SPS  is  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA, DOT and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nSPS  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy  related  products.  SPS  uses  physical  and  financial  instruments  to minimize commodity price risk and to hedge sales and purchases. Sharing of  any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\n\n## Other\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nXcel  Energy's  ability  to  meet  customer  energy  requirements,  respond  to storm-related disruptions, and execute our capital expenditure program are dependent  on  maintaining  an  efficient  supply  chain.  Manufacturing processes  have  experienced  disruptions  related  to  the  scarcity  of  certain raw  materials  and  interruptions  in  production  and  shipping.  Inflationary pressures,  labor  shortages,  and  the  impact  of  geopolitical  events  have further exacerbated these disruptions. Xcel Energy continues to monitor the situation as it remains fluid and seeks to mitigate the impacts by securing alternative suppliers, modifying design standards, and adjusting the timing of work.\n\nAdditionally,  certain  products,  components,  and  equipment,  particularly  in renewables categories, originate in countries that could face tariffs, fines, or restrictions from government or other regulatory bodies and present a cost and  supply  risk  until  there  is  sufficient  capacity  and  supply  base  with adequate capacity to meet US needs.\n\n## Electric Meters and Transformers\n\nSupply  chain  issues  associated  with  semiconductors  delayed  the availability  of  AMI  meters,  which  led  to  a  reduced  number  of  meters deployed  in  2022.  Xcel  Energy  saw  significant  improvement  in  meter availability  in  2023  and  we  expect  normal  conditions  in  2024  and  going forward. Xcel Energy expects to complete AMI meter deployment in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, the availability of certain transformers is an industry-wide issue that  has  significantly  impacted  and  in  some  cases  resulted  in  delays  to projects  and  new  customer  connections.  Proposed  governmental  actions related to transformer efficiency standards may compound these delays in the future. Xcel Energy continues to seek alternative suppliers and prioritize work plans to mitigate the impacts of supply constraints.\n\n## Solar Resources\n\nIn  August  2023,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  completed  its  anticircumvention investigation. It concluded that CSPV solar panels and cells imported  from  Malaysia,  Vietnam,  Thailand,  and  Cambodia  would  be subject to incremental tariffs ranging from 50% to 250%. These countries account for more than 80% of CSPV panel imports.",

        "page_content": "An interim stay on tariffs remains in effect until June 2024. Many significant solar  projects  have  resumed  with  modified  costs  and  projected  in-service dates, including the Sherco Solar facility in Minnesota and certain PPAs in PSCo. Further policy action, a change in the interim stay of tariffs, or other restrictions  on  solar  imports  (e.g.,  due  to  implementation  of  the  Uyghur Forced  Labor  Protection  Act)  or  disruptions  in  solar  imports  from  key suppliers could impact project timelines and costs.\n\n## New Technology and Government Grants\n\n## Hydrogen Hub Grant\n\nIn October 2023, the DOE selected the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, including multiple clean hydrogen projects from Xcel Energy, for award negotiations to receive up to $925 million. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is one of seven selected to receive DOE funding. The hub includes Xcel Energy, Marathon Petroleum Corporation and TC Energy, in collaboration with the University of  North  Dakota's  Energy  &  Environmental  Resource  Center,  to  produce and  use  low-carbon  hydrogen  at  commercial  scale  in  Minnesota, Wisconsin,  South  Dakota,  North  Dakota  and  Montana.  The  hub  aims  to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per year. Xcel Energy  expects  to  receive  a  large  portion  of  the  federal  award  for  its projects  within  the  hub,  subject  to  negotiations.  In  its  application,  Xcel Energy  proposed  investing  up  to  $2  billion  over  a  decade  for  clean hydrogen producing equipment and infrastructure, representing 75% of full program costs for the company's portion of the hub. Project detailed design will  begin  after  the  Heartland  Hydrogen  Hub  finishes  award  negotiations. Project development will likely continue through 2035.\n\n## Form Energy Long Duration Storage Grant\n\nIn September 2023, the DOE awarded Xcel Energy a $70 million grant to support  our  two  10  MW,  100-hour  battery  pilots  with  Form  Energy.  Xcel Energy expects to develop a 10 MW 100-hour-battery storage unit at the Sherco retiring coal plant site in Minnesota and the Comanche retiring coal plant site in Colorado. Combined with grants from Breakthrough Energy's Catalyst Fund, Xcel Energy has secured $90 million to support these pilots, which will reduce the costs of the projects for our customers. Long duration energy storage systems are critical to achieve 100% carbon free generation and strengthen the grid from the variability of renewable energy.\n\n## Wildfire/Extreme Weather Grant\n\nIn  October  2023,  the  DOE  awarded  Xcel  Energy  $100  million  to  support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Xcel Energy plans to match the grant with $140 million of investment. The projects will take a number of steps to boost grid resiliency,  including  adding  fire-resistant  coatings  to  6,000  wood  poles, improving  equipment  safety  features  in  power  lines  and  electric  vehicle chargers  in  high  fire  risk  conditions,  moving  high-risk  distribution  circuits underground, and enhancing vegetation management. They will also build on current programs using emerging technology, such as drones aided by artificial  intelligence  that  inspect  power  lines  for  safety,  wind  strength testing,  satellite  identification  of  trees  that  pose  a  risk  and  modeling software to predict how fires would spread.\n\n## Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue (JTIQ) Grant\n\nIn October 2023, the DOE awarded a $464 million grant to Xcel Energy and several  other  utilities  for  five  JTIQ  projects.  The  projects  are  part  of  a collaboration between MISO and SPP that will help to fund the construction of  high-voltage  transmission  lines  that  improve  reliability  and  resolve constraints  in  the  transmission  system  for  up  to  30  gigawatts  of  new generation. Xcel Energy is part of two of these project awards.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application  of  accounting  rules  and  guidance,  as  well  as  the  use  of estimates. Application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  based  on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  operation  of  the  business  and results reported.\n\nAccounting policies and estimates that are most significant to Xcel Energy's results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows,  and  require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below.  Each  of  these  has  a  higher  likelihood  of  resulting  in  materially different  reported  amounts  under  different  conditions  or  using  different assumptions.  Each  critical  accounting  policy  has  been  reviewed  and discussed  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  Board  of Directors on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nXcel Energy is subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations , which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates  will  be  charged  and  collected.  Our  rates  are  derived  through  the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.\n\nRegulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been  deferred  because  future  recovery  from  customers  is  probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for  future  costs.  In  other  businesses  or  industries,  regulatory  assets  and regulatory  liabilities  would  generally  be  charged  to  net  income  or  other comprehensive income.\n\nEach reporting  period  we  assess  the  probability  of  future  recoveries  and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the  current  regulatory  environment,  recently  issued  rate  orders  and historical  precedents  are  considered.  Decisions  made  by  regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as  the  rate  of  return  on  invested  capital,  and  may  materially  impact  our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, Xcel Energy had regulatory assets of $3.4 billion  and $3.9 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $6.4 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2023,  in  assessing  the  probability  of  recovery  of  recognized regulatory  assets,  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  Xcel  Energy  noted  no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the recovery of the assets.\n\nSee  Notes  4  and  12  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further information.",

        "page_content": "## Income Tax Accruals\n\nJudgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax  accrual  process  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  current  and  deferred income  taxes.  Uncertainty  associated  with  the  application  of  tax  statutes and  regulations  and  outcomes  of  tax  audits  and  appeals  require  that judgment  and  estimates  be  made  in  the  accrual  process  and  in  the calculation of the ETR.\n\nChanges in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities  and  our  future  ETR.  ETR  calculations  are  revised  every  quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  interim  period  reporting  guidance,  income  tax expense for  the  first  three  quarters  in  a  year  is  based  on  the  forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\n\nValuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized.\n\nWe  may  adjust  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  and  interest  accruals  as disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved, and as new developments  occur.  These  adjustments  may  increase  or  decrease earnings.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe  sponsor  several  noncontributory,  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and other  postretirement  benefit  plans  that  cover  almost  all  employees  and certain retirees. Projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on  pension  and  postretirement  health  care  investment  assets,  discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). In addition, the pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  methodology  to  reduce  the  volatility  of investment  performance  over  time.  Pension  assumptions  are  continually reviewed.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2023,  Xcel  Energy  set  the  rate  of  return  on  assets  used  to measure pension costs at 6.93%, which is unchanged from the rate set at Dec. 31, 2022. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.00% at Dec. 31, 2023, which is unchanged from the rate set in  2022. Xcel Energy's pension investment strategy includes plan-specific investments  that  seek  to  align  the  investment  allocations  to  optimize  risk adjusted  return  and  interest  rate  risk  management  based  on  factors  that include the plan's funded status. This strategy generally results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with higher  funded  status  ratios  and  a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets being allocated to plans having lower funded status ratios.\n\nXcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations and postretirement health care obligations at 5.49% and 5.54% at Dec. 31, 2023,  respectively.  This  represents  a  31  basis  point  and  26  basis  point decrease,  respectively,  from  2022.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  bond  matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension  and  postretirement  health  care  obligations.  The  bond  matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the  expected  cash  flows  of  Xcel  Energy's  benefit  plans  in  amount  and duration.\n\nThe effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for  reasonableness against the Bank of America US Corporate 15+ Bond Index.  In  addition,  Xcel  Energy  reviews  general  actuarial  survey  data  to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\n\nIf  Xcel  Energy  were  to  use  alternative  assumptions,  a  1%  change  would result in the following impact on 2023 pension costs:\n\n|                       | Pension Costs   | Pension Costs   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | +1%             | -1%             |\n| Rate of return  (a)   | $  (10)         | $  26           |\n| Discount rate  (a)    | 3               | 8               |\n\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. Xcel Energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. Xcel Energy  considers  standard  mortality  tables,  improvement  factors  and  the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\n\nAs of  Dec.  31,  2023,  the  initial  medical  trend  cost  claim  assumptions  for Pre-65  was  6.5%  and  Post-65  was  5.5%.  The  ultimate  trend  assumption remained at 4.5% for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims costs. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care  market,  considering  the  levels  projected  and recommended by industry experts,  as  well  as  recent  actual  medical  cost experienced by Xcel Energy's retiree medical plan.\n\nFunding  contributions  in  2023  were  $50  million  and  will  remain  relatively consistent in  future  years,  with  the  exception  of  2024,  when  Xcel  Energy plans  on  making  a  higher  contributions  as  a  result  of  the  Voluntary Retirement Program offering in 2023. Investment returns were more than the  assumed  levels  in  2023  and  2021,  but  were  less  than  the  assumed levels in 2022.\n\nThe  pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  market-related  valuation  of  pension assets.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  calculated  value  method  to  determine  the market-related  value  of  the  plan  assets.  The  market-related  value  is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the  actual  investment  return  and  the  expected  investment  return  on  the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20% per year.\n\nAs  differences  between  actual  and  expected  investment  returns  are incorporated  into  the  market-related  value,  amounts  are  recognized  in pension  cost  over  the  expected  average  remaining  years  of  service  for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2023).\n\nXcel  Energy  currently  projects  the  pension  costs  recognized  for  financial reporting purposes will be $59 million in 2024 and $61 million in 2025, while the actual pension costs were $74 million in 2023 and $114 in 2022. The expected decrease in 2024 is primarily due to reductions in the effects or regulations.\n\nPension  funding  contributions  across  all  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2021 - 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 $100 million in January 2024.\n- \u00b7 $50 million in 2023.\n- \u00b7 $50 million in 2022.\n- \u00b7 $131 million in 2021.",

        "page_content": "Future  amounts  may  change  based  on  actual  market  performance, changes  in  interest  rates  and  any  changes  in  governmental  regulations. Therefore,  additional  contributions  could  be  required  in  the  future.  Xcel Energy  contributed  $11  million,  $13  million  and  $15  million  during  2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $11 million during 2024. Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\n\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota  recognizes  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions  using  the  aggregate  normal  cost  actuarial  method. Differences  between  aggregate  normal  cost  and  expense  as calculated  by  pension  accounting  standards  are  deferred  as  a regulatory liability.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  the  PSCW  approved  NSP-Wisconsin's  request  for  deferred accounting  treatment  of  the  2021  pension  settlement  accounting expense. Escrow accounting treatment was also approved for ongoing pension  and  other  post-employment  benefit  expenses,  including settlement charges.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory Commissions  in  Texas,  New  Mexico  and  FERC jurisdictions  allow  the  recovery  of  other  postretirement  benefit  costs only  to  the  extent  that  recognized  expense  is  matched  by  cash contributions  to  an  irrevocable  trust.  Xcel  Energy  has  consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.\n- \u00b7 PSCo is required to create a regulatory liability that adjusts the annual post-retirement benefits amount to zero in order to match the amount collected in rates.\n- \u00b7 PSCo  and  SPS  recognize  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions based on GAAP. The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions  and  the  Colorado  gas  retail  jurisdiction,  each  record  the difference  between  annual  recognized  pension  expense  and  the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.\n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nXcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived  assets  for  which  a  legal  obligation  exists.  These  AROs  are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of  the  related  long-lived  assets.  In  the  absence  of  quoted  market  prices, Xcel  Energy  estimates  the  fair  value  of  its  AROs  using  present  value techniques,  in  which  it  makes  assumptions  including  estimates  of  the amounts  and  timing  of  future  cash  flows  associated  with  retirement activities,  credit-adjusted  risk  free  rates  and  cost  escalation  rates.  When Xcel  Energy  revises  any  assumptions,  it  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of both  the  ARO  liability  and  related  long-lived  asset.  ARO  liabilities  are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  Xcel  Energy's  AROs  relates  to  the  future decommissioning  of  NSP-Minnesota's  nuclear  facilities.  The  nuclear decommissioning  obligation  is  funded  by  the  external  decommissioning trust  fund.  Difference  between  regulatory  funding  (including  depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.1 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022.\n\nNSP-Minnesota obtains periodic independent cost studies to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. Estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.\n\nThe 2022 - 2024 Nuclear Decommissioning Study and Assumptions were approved  by  the  MPUC  in  August  2022.  The  MPUC  ordered  the  next triennial decommissioning study be filed by December 1, 2024, allowing for four years between filings.\n\nThe  following  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  estimated nuclear obligation:\n\nTiming - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement  date  and  timing  of  the  actual  decommissioning  activities. Estimated  retirement  dates  coincide  with  the  approved  retirement  dates which  can  be  different  than  the  expiration  dates  of  each  unit's  operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for PI's Unit 1 and 2, respectively).\n\nIn  April  2022,  the  Company  received  approval  from  the  MPUC,  in  the Integrated  Resource  Plan,  to  pursue  extending  the  operating  life  of  the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant by ten years from 2030 to 2040. This life  extension  is  subject  to  NRC  approval  of  Monticello's  nuclear  license extension request.\n\nThe  retirement  dates  of  the  Prairie  Island  Unit  1  and  Unit  2  remain unchanged,  2033  and  2034  respectively.  The  estimated  timing  of  the decommissioning  activities  is  based  upon  the  DECON  method,  which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. Decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the commission approved retirement date and be completed for both facilities by 2101.\n\nTechnology  and  Regulation -  There  is  limited  experience  with  actual decommissioning  of  large  nuclear  facilities.  Changes  in  technology, experience  and  regulations  could  cause  cost  estimates  to  change significantly.\n\nEscalation  Rates -  Escalation  rates  represent  projected  cost  increases due  to  general  inflation  and  increases  in  the  cost  of  decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.2% in calculating the ARO  for  nuclear  decommissioning  of  its  nuclear  facilities,  based  on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nDiscount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current creditadjusted  risk-free  interest  rate.  The  credit-adjusted  risk-free  rate  in  effect when the  change  occurs  is  used  to  discount  the  revised  estimate  of  the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.\n\nIf  the  change  in  timing  or  estimated  expected  cash  flows  results  in  a downward  revision  of  the  ARO,  the  undiscounted  revised  estimate  of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect  at  the  date  of  initial  measurement  and  recognition  of  the  original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to  calculate  the  net  present  value  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows  over time.\n\nSignificant  uncertainties  exist  in  estimating  future  costs  including  the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.",

        "page_content": "However,  changes  in  estimates  have  minimal  impact  on  results  of operations  as  NSP-Minnesota  expects  to  continue  to  recover  all  costs  in future rates.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  continually  makes  judgments  and  estimates  related  to these  critical  accounting  policy  areas,  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the assumptions  and  uncertainties  for  each  area.  The  information  and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.\n\nThis may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements  reflect  management's  best  estimates  and  judgments  of  the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Loss Contingencies - Marshall Fire\n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against Xcel Energy related  to  the  Marshall  Fire  are  subject  to  uncertainty.  An  estimated  loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued if it is probable of being incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Each  reporting  period  we  evaluate,  among  other  factors,  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. The process for evaluating any wildfire-related liabilities requires a series of complex judgments about past and future events. Factors such as the cause of the wildfire, the extent and magnitude of potential damages, and the status of investigations and legal proceedings  are  considered.  See  Note  12  to  the  consolidated  financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks  in  the  normal  course  of business.  Market  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of adverse changes in the market or fair value for a particular instrument or commodity.  All  financial  and  commodity-related  instruments,  including derivatives, are subject to market risk.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  exposed  to  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  price  for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its  derivatives  and  other  contracts,  including  parental  guarantees  and requests of collateral. While we expect that the counterparties will perform on  the  contracts  underlying  our  derivatives,  the  contracts  expose  us  to credit and non-performance risk.\n\nDistress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk and the fair value  of  the  securities  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  fund  and  pension fund.\n\nCommodity Price Risk -We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  Commodity  price  risk  is  managed  by entering into long and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric  capacity,  energy  and  energy-related  products  and  fuels  used  in generation and distribution activities.\n\nCommodity  price  risk  is  also  managed  through  the  use  of  financial derivative  instruments.  Our  risk  management  policy  allows  us  to  manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading  Risk -Xcel  Energy  conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  energy-related  instruments  and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by our risk management committee.\n\nFair value of net commodity trading contracts as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n\n|                       | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | Less  Than 1 Year             | 1 to 3  Years                 | 4 to 5  Years                 | Greater  Than 5 Years         | Total  Fair Value             |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (a)    | $  1                          | $  (3)                        | $  (3)                        | $  -                          | $  (5)                        |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (b)    | (1)                           | (8)                           | (6)                           | (1)                           | (16)                          |\n| PSCo  (a)             | -                             | 1                             | 2                             | -                             | 3                             |\n| PSCo  (b)             | (10)                          | 6                             | 2                             | -                             | (2)                           |\n|                       | $  (10)                       | $  (4)                        | $  (5)                        | $  (1)                        | $  (20)                       |\n\n|                       | Options Maturity   | Options Maturity   | Options Maturity   | Options Maturity      | Options Maturity   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | Less  Than 1 Year  | 1 to 3  Years      | 4 to 5  Years      | Greater  Than 5 Years | Total Fair  Value  |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (b)    | $  -               | $  -               | $  9               | $  8                  | $  17              |\n| PSCo  (b)             | 4                  | -                  | -                  | -                     | 4                  |\n|                       | $  4               | $  -               | $  9               | $  8                  | $  21              |\n\nChanges in the fair value of commodity trading contracts before the impacts of margin-sharing for the years ended Dec. 31:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fair value of commodity trading net contracts outstanding at Jan. 1  | $  (10) | $  (33) |\n| Contracts realized or settled during the period                      | (2)     | (15)    |\n| Commodity trading contract additions and changes during the period   | 13      | 38      |\n| Fair value of commodity trading net contracts outstanding at Dec. 31 | $  1    | $  (10) |\n\nA  10%  increase  and  10%  decrease  in  forward  market  prices  for  Xcel Energy's commodity trading contracts would have likewise increased and decreased  pretax  income  from  continuing  operations,  by  approximately $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and $8 million at Dec. 31, 2022. Market price movements can exceed 10% under abnormal circumstances.\n\nXcel Energy's' commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on contracts and obligations using an industry standard methodology known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in  fair  value  of  the  outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.\n\nThe VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, excluding  both  non-derivative  transactions  and  derivative  transactions designated  as  normal  purchases  and  normal  sales,  calculated  on  a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:\n\n|   (Millions of Dollars) | Year Ended Dec. 31   | Average   | High   | Low   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|-------|\n|                    2023 | $  -                 | $  -      | $  1   | $  -  |\n|                    2022 | 2                    | 1         | 5      | -     |",

        "page_content": "Nuclear  Fuel  Supply -  NSP-Minnesota  has  contracted  for  its  2024 through 2027 enriched nuclear material requirements, which are in various stages  of  processing  in  Canada,  Europe  and  the  United  States.  NSPMinnesota  is  scheduled  to  take  delivery  of  approximately  29%  of  its average enriched nuclear material requirements from Russia through 2030. Given  the  evolving  situation  in  Ukraine  and  its  global  impacts,  we  have entered  into  additional new  contracts  that  cover  potential  supply interruptions of nuclear material from Russia.\n\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to interest rate risk. Our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives.\n\nA 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $9 million and $8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nNSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate and equity  price  risk.  The  fund  is  invested  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning NSP-Minnesota's nuclear generating plants.\n\nFluctuations  in  equity  prices  or  interest  rates  affecting  the  nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting. Realized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning  fund  investments  are  deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSPMinnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.\n\nThe value of pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit costs are impacted by changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel  Energy's  ongoing  pension  and  postretirement  investment  strategy  is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to optimize potential  investment  risk  and  minimize  interest  rate  risk  associated  with changes in the obligations as a plan's funded status increases over time. The impacts of fluctuations in interest rates on pension and postretirement costs  are  mitigated  by  pension  cost  calculation  methodologies  and regulatory  mechanisms  that  minimize  the  earnings  impacts  of  such changes.\n\nCredit Risk -Xcel Energy is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  counterparties'  nonperformance  on  their contractual  obligations.  Xcel  Energy  maintains  credit  policies  intended  to minimize  overall  credit  risk  and  actively  monitors  these  policies  to  reflect changes and scope of operations.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $27 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $24 million. At Dec. 31, 2022, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $56 million, while a decrease in prices of  10%  would  have  resulted  in  an  decrease  in  credit  exposure  of  $47 million.\n\nXcel  Energy  conducts  credit  reviews  for  all  wholesale,  trading  and  nontrading commodity counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters  of  credit,  parental  guarantees,  master  netting  agreements  and termination provisions.\n\nCredit  exposure  is  monitored,  and  when  necessary,  the  activity  with  a specific  counterparty  is  limited  until  credit  enhancement  is  provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase our credit risk.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nDerivative  contracts,  with  the  exception  of  those  designated  as  normal purchases  and  normal  sales,  are  reported  at  fair  value.  Xcel  Energy's investments  held  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  fund,  rabbi  trusts, pension  and  other  postretirement  funds  are  also  subject  to  fair  value accounting.

The  increase  was  largely  due  to  continued collections  of  prior  year  deferred  net  natural  gas,  fuel  and  purchased energy  costs,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  decreased  natural  gas  prices  on accounts payable and receivables.\n\n## Investing Cash Flows\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                    | Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash used in investing activities - 2022 | $  (4,653)                    |\n| Components of change - 2023 vs. 2022     |                               |\n| Increased capital expenditures           | (1,216)                       |\n| Other investing activities               | (57)                          |\n| Cash used in investing activities - 2023 | $  (5,926)                    |\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,273 million for 2023 as compared to 2022.

Xcel Energy expects to have adequate amounts of cash  from  operating  and  financing  activities  to  meet  both  its  short-term  and  long-term  cash  requirements.  Xcel  Energy's  financing  requirements  are dependent on both existing  contractual  obligations  and  other  commitments,  as  well  as  projected  capital  forecasts.  Xcel  Energy  expects  to  meet  future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, hybrid and other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios.  Projected  future  financing  requirements  can  be  impacted  by  various  factors  including  constraints  to  supply  chain  and  labor,  regulatory  lag  and inflation.\n\n## Material Cash Requirements and Other Commitments\n\n|                                                             | Payments Due by Period (as of Dec. 31, 2023)   | Payments Due by Period (as of Dec. 31, 2023)   | Payments Due by Period (as of Dec. 31, 2023)   | Payments Due by Period (as of Dec. 31, 2023)   | Payments Due by Period (as of Dec. 31, 2023)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                       | Total                                          | Less than 1 Year                               | 1 to 3 Years                                   | 3 to 5 Years                                   | After 5 Years                                  |\n| Long-term debt, principal and interest payments             | $  43,659                                      | $  1,567                                       | $  3,631                                       | $  3,564                                       | $  34,897                                      |\n| Finance lease obligations                                   | 218                                            | 10                                             | 19                                             | 16                                             | 173                                            |\n| Operating leases obligations  (a)                           | 1,520                                          | 277                                            | 509                                            | 313                                            | 421                                            |\n| Unconditional purchase obligations  (b) (c)                 | 4,022                                          | 1,429                                          | 1,267                                          | 686                                            | 640                                            |\n| Other long-term obligations, including current portion  (d) | 57                                             | 18                                             | 27                                             | 12                                             | -

Financing  plans  are  subject  to  change, depending  on  capital  expenditures,  regulatory  outcomes,  internal  cash generation, market conditions, changes in tax policies and other factors.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Earnings  Guidance  and  Long-Term  EPS  and  Dividend  Growth  Rate Objectives\n\nXcel  Energy  2024  Earnings  Guidance -  Xcel  Energy's  2024  ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. (a)\n\nKey assumptions as compared with 2023 actual levels unless noted:\n\n- \u00b7 Constructive  outcomes  in  all  pending  rate  case  and  regulatory proceedings.\n- \u00b7 Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase 2% to 3%.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized retail  firm  natural  gas  sales  are  projected  to  be flat.\n- \u00b7 Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $70 million to $80 million (net of PTCs).\n- \u00b7 O&M expenses are projected to increase 1% to 2%.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation  expense  is  projected  to  increase  approximately  $250 million to $260 million.\n- \u00b7 Property taxes are projected to increase $50 million to $60 million.\n- \u00b7 Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest income.\n- \u00b7 AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $45 million to $55 million.\n- \u00b7 ETR is  projected  to  be  ~(4%)  to  (6%).  The  negative  ETR  is  largely offset by PTCs flowing back to customers in the capital riders and fuel mechanisms and is largely earnings neutral. The projected ETR does not  reflect  the  potential  impact  of  nuclear  PTCs,  which  are  also expected to flow back to customers.\n- (a) Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing  earnings  could  differ  from  those  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  for unplanned  and/or  unknown  adjustments.  As  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  quantify  the financial  impacts  of  any  additional  adjustments  that  may  occur  for  the  year,  we  are unable  to  provide  a  quantitative  reconciliation  of  the  guidance  for  ongoing  EPS  to corresponding GAAP EPS.\n\nLong-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives -Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 5% to 7% based off of a 2023 actual ongoing earnings base of $3.35 per share.\n- \u00b7 Deliver annual dividend increases of 5% to 7%.\n- \u00b7 Target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60%.\n- \u00b7 Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nSee the 'Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk' section in Item 7, incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee Item 15-1 for an index of financial statements included herein.\n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.",

Xcel Energy Inc.'s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Xcel Energy Inc.'s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. management assessed the effectiveness of Xcel Energy Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2023. In making this assessment,  it  used  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO)  in  Internal  Control  Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  has  issued  an  attestation  report  on  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  internal  control  over  financial reporting.

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc .\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  to  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the 'Commissions'). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  prepare  its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes.\n\nThe Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company's regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the  rate  setting  process,  the  Company's  rates  result  in  the  recording  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  the  probability  of  future  cash  flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds due to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n- \u00b7 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, other regulatory filings, legal decisions and recommendations being evaluated by the Commissions, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. We evaluated historic orders for precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We compared the regulatory orders, filings and other publicly available information to the Company's recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n- \u00b7 We  obtained  management's  analysis  and  correspondence  from  counsel,  as  appropriate,  regarding  regulatory  assets  or  liabilities  not  yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 21, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGeneral -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility  subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the regulated  generation,  purchase,  transmission,  distribution  and  sale  of electricity and the regulated purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.\n\nXcel Energy's regulated operations include the activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin,  PSCo  and  SPS.  These  utility  subsidiaries  serve  electric and natural  gas  customers  in  portions  of  Colorado,  Michigan,  Minnesota, New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin.  Also included in regulated operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s nonregulated subsidiaries include:\n\n| Nonregulated Subsidiary             | Purpose                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eloigne                             | Invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income  housing tax credits.                                 |\n| Capital Services                    | Procures equipment for construction of renewable  generation facilities at other subsidiaries.                       |\n| Xcel Energy Venture  Holdings, Inc. | Invests in limited partnerships, including EIP funds with  portfolios of investments in energy technology companies. |\n| Nicollet Project Holdings           | Invests in nonregulated assets such as the Minnesota  community solar gardens.                                       |\n\nXcel Energy Inc. owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries:\n\n## Direct Subsidiary\n\n| Xcel Energy Wholesale Group Inc.              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc.             |\n| Xcel Energy Ventures Inc.                     |\n| Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc.              |\n| Xcel Energy International Inc.                |\n| Xcel Energy Transmission Holding Company, LLC |\n| Nicollet Holdings Company, LLC                |\n| Xcel Energy Nuclear Services Holdings, LLC    |\n| Xcel Energy Services Inc.                     |\n\nXcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.\n\nXcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  and  VIEs  for  which  it  is  the  primary  beneficiary.  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated unless a different treatment is appropriate for rate regulated transactions. The equity method of accounting is used for its investments in EIP funds and WYCO.\n\nInvestments in certain  plants  and  transmission  facilities  are  jointly  owned with nonaffiliated utilities. A proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is recorded  as  property,  plant  and  equipment  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets, and Xcel Energy's share of operating costs associated with these facilities is included in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  accordance  with GAAP.  All  of  the  utility  subsidiaries'  underlying  accounting  records  also conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts.\n\nCertain  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  notes  have been reclassified for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.\n\nXcel Energy has evaluated events occurring after Dec. 31, 2023 up to the date  of  issuance  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  These statements  contain  all  necessary  adjustments  and  disclosures  resulting from that evaluation.\n\nUse  of  Estimates -  Xcel  Energy  uses  estimates  based  on  the  best information  available  to  record  transactions  and  balances  resulting  from business operations.\n\nEstimates are used for items such as plant depreciable lives or  potential disallowances,  AROs,  certain  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional  fuel  and  energy  cost  allocations  and  actuarially  determined benefit  costs.  Recorded  estimates  are  revised  when  better  information becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  can  be  determined.  Revisions  can affect operating results.\n\nRegulatory  Accounting - The regulated  utility  subsidiaries  account  for income  and  expense  items  in  accordance  with  accounting  guidance  for regulated operations. Under this guidance:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or other comprehensive  income,  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  based  on the expected ability to recover the costs in future rates.\n- \u00b7 Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the  expectation  the  amounts  will  be  returned  to  customers  in  future rates,  or  because  the  amounts  were  collected  in  rates  prior  to  the costs being incurred.\n\nEstimates  and  assumptions  for  recovery  of  deferred  costs  and  refund  of deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking decisions, precedent or other available information. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.\n\nIf changes in the regulatory environment occur, the utility subsidiaries may no  longer  be  eligible  to  apply  this  accounting  treatment  and  may  be required to eliminate regulatory assets and liabilities. Such changes could have  a  material  effect  on  Xcel  Energy's  results  of  operations,  financial condition and cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\nIncome Taxes - Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are deferred for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income  and  between  the  book  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities utilizing  rates  that  are  scheduled  to  be  in  effect  when  the  temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nUtility  rate  regulation  has  resulted  in  the  recognition  of  regulatory  assets and liabilities related to income taxes. The effects of tax rate changes that are  attributable  to  the  utility  subsidiaries  are  generally  subject  to  a normalization method of accounting. Therefore, the revaluation of most of the utility subsidiaries' net deferred taxes upon a tax rate reduction results in  the  establishment  of  a  net  regulatory  liability,  refundable  to  utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets.\n\nXcel Energy anticipates that a tax rate increase would predominantly result in  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  asset,  subject  to  an  evaluation  of whether future recovery is expected.",

        "page_content": "Reversal  of  certain  temporary  differences  are  accounted  for  as  current income tax expense due to the effects of past regulatory practices  when deferred  taxes  were  not  required  to  be  recorded  due  to  the  use  of  flow through accounting for ratemaking purposes.\n\nTax  credits  are  recorded  when  earned  unless  there  is  a  requirement  to defer  the  benefit  and  amortize  over  the  book  depreciable  lives  of  related property. The requirement to defer and amortize these credits specifically applies to certain federal ITCs, as determined by tax regulations and Xcel Energy  tax  elections.  For  tax  credits  otherwise  eligible  to  be  recognized when  earned,  Xcel  Energy  considers  the  impact  of  rate  regulation  to determine if these credits and related adjustments should be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than  not  that  some  portion  or  all  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be realized. This evaluation includes consideration of whether tax credits are expected  to  be  sold  at  a  discount  and  impact  the  realization  of  amounts presented as deferred tax assets. Transferable tax credits are accounted for  under  ASC  740 Income  Taxes ,  and  valuation  allowances  and  any adjustments  for  discounts  incurred  on  sales  transactions  are  recorded  to deferred  tax  expense,  typically  recovered  in  the  utility  subsidiaries' regulatory mechanisms.\n\nXcel  Energy  measures  and  discloses  uncertain  tax  positions  that  it  has taken  or  expects  to  take  in  its  income  tax  returns.  A  tax  position  is recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical  merits  of  the  position.  Recognition  of  changes  in  uncertain  tax positions are reflected as a component of income tax expense.\n\nInterest  and  penalties  related  to  income  taxes  are  reported  within  Other income (expense), net or interest charges in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated  federal  income  tax returns  as  well  as  consolidated  or  separate  state  income  tax  returns. Federal  income  taxes  paid  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  are  allocated  to  its subsidiaries based on separate company computations. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with consolidated  state  filings.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  also  allocates  its  own  income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries.\n\n## See Note 7 for further information.\n\nProperty,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  Depreciation  in  Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs  and  AFUDC.  The  cost  of  plant  retired  is  charged  to  accumulated depreciation  and  amortization.  Amounts  recovered  in  rates  for  future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or improvements  extending  asset  lives  are  capitalized,  while  repairs  and maintenance costs and replacement of items determined to be less than a unit of property are charged to expense as incurred.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  tested  for  impairment  when  it  is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost  of  a  plant  under  construction  or  recently  completed  plant  will  be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance  can  be  made.  For  investments  in  property,  plant  and equipment  that  are  abandoned  and  not  expected  to  go  into  service, incurred  costs  and  related  deferred  tax  amounts  are  compared  to  the discounted  estimated  future  rate  recovery,  and  a  loss  is  recognized,  if necessary.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the plant's commission approved useful life. Actuarial life studies are performed and  submitted  to  the  state  and  federal  commissions  for  review.  Upon acceptance by the various commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage rates are used to calculate depreciation. Plant removal costs are typically recognized  at  the  amounts  recovered  in  rates  as  authorized  by  the applicable  regulator.  Accumulated  removal  costs  are  reflected  in  the consolidated balance sheet as a regulatory liability. Depreciation expense, expressed  as  a  percentage  of  average  depreciable  property,  was approximately 3.6% for 2023, 3.7% for 2022 and 3.5% for 2021.\n\n## See Note 3 for further information.\n\nAROs -Xcel Energy records AROs as a liability in the period incurred (if fair value can be reasonably estimated), with the offsetting/associated costs capitalized  as  a  long-lived  asset.  The  liability  is  generally  increased  over time  by  applying  the  effective  interest  method  of  accretion  and  the capitalized costs are typically depreciated over the useful life of the longlived  asset.  Changes  resulting  from  revisions  to  timing  or  amounts  of expected asset retirement cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.\n\n## See Note 12 for further information.\n\nNuclear  Decommissioning -  Nuclear  decommissioning  studies  that estimate  NSP-Minnesota's  costs  of  decommissioning  its  nuclear  power plants are normally performed at least every three years and submitted to the  state  commissions  for  approval.  Due  to  other  regulatory  activity,  the next decommissioning study has been deferred one year until 2024.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recovers regulator-approved decommissioning costs of its nuclear  power  plants  over  each  facility's  expected  service  life,  typically based  on  the  triennial  decommissioning  studies.  The  studies  consider estimated  future  costs  of  decommissioning  and  the  market  value  of investments  in  trust  funds  and  recommend  annual  funding  amounts. Amounts collected in  rates  are  deposited  in  the  trust  funds.  For  financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear decommissioning as an ARO.\n\nRestricted  funds  for  future  decommissioning  expenditures  for  NSPMinnesota's nuclear facilities are included in nuclear decommissioning fund and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 12 for further information.\n\nBenefit  Plans  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits -  Xcel  Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing  the  cost  of  providing  benefits  and  measuring  the  projected benefit  obligation  of  these  plans  requires  management  to  make  various assumptions and estimates.",

        "page_content": "Certain  unrecognized  actuarial  gains  and  losses  and  unrecognized  prior service  costs  or  credits  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\n## See Note 11 for further information.\n\nEnvironmental  Costs -  Environmental  costs  are  recorded  when  it  is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the amount can be reasonably  estimated.  Costs  are  deferred  as  a  regulatory  asset  if  it  is probable  the  costs  will  be  recovered  from  customers  in  future  rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. For certain environmental costs related to  facilities  currently  in  use,  such  as  for  emission-control  equipment,  the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.\n\nEstimated  remediation  costs  are  regularly  adjusted  as  estimates  are revised  and  remediation  is  performed.  If  other  participating  potentially responsible parties exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site,  costs  are  estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy's expected share of the cost.\n\nEstimated future expenditures to restore sites are treated as a capitalized cost  of  plant  retirement.  The  depreciation  expense  levels  recoverable  in rates include a provision for removal expenses. Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nRevenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers -  Performance  obligations related  to  the  sale  of  energy  are  satisfied  as  energy  is  delivered  to customers. Xcel Energy recognizes revenue that corresponds to the price of the energy delivered to the customer. The measurement of energy sales to  customers  is  generally  based  on  the  reading  of  their  meters,  which occurs  systematically  throughout  the  month.  At  the  end  of  each  month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading  are  estimated,  and  the  corresponding  unbilled  revenue  is recognized.\n\nA  separate  financing  component  of  collections  from  customers  is  not recognized as contract terms are short-term in nature. Revenues are net of any excise or sales taxes or fees. The utility subsidiaries recognize physical sales to customers (native load and wholesale) on a gross basis in electric revenues and cost of sales. Revenues and charges for short-term physical wholesale sales of excess energy transacted through RTO/ISOs are also recorded on a gross basis. Other revenues and charges settled/facilitated through an RTO/ISO are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nCash  and  Cash  Equivalents -  Xcel  Energy  considers  investments  in instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\nAccounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  for  Bad  Debts -  Accounts receivable  are  stated  at  the  actual  billed  amount  net  of  an  allowance  for bad  debts.  Xcel  Energy  establishes  an  allowance  for  uncollectible receivables  based  on  a  policy  that  reflects  its  expected  exposure  to  the credit risk of customers.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  allowance  for  bad  debts  was  $128 million and $122 million, respectively.\n\nInventory -  Inventory  is  recorded  at  the  lower  of  average  cost  or  net realizable value and consisted of the following:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Inventories             |                 |                 |\n| Materials and supplies  | $  377          | $  330          |\n| Fuel                    | 211             | 201             |\n| Natural gas             | 123             | 272             |\n| Total inventories       | $  711          | $  803          |\n\nEquity Method Investments -The equity method of accounting is used for certain investments including WYCO and EIP funds, which requires Xcel Energy's recognition of its share of these investees' results, based on Xcel Energy's proportional ownership interest. For investments in EIP funds, this includes  Xcel  Energy's  share  of  fund  expenses  and  realized  gains  and losses, as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuations of the funds' investments in emerging energy technology companies.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements -  Xcel  Energy  presents  cash  equivalents, interest rate derivatives, rabbi trust assets, commodity derivatives, pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning fund assets at estimated fair values in its consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor interest rate derivatives, quoted prices based primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used to estimate fair value. For commodity derivatives,  the  most  observable  inputs  available  are  generally  used  to determine the fair value of each contract. In the absence of a quoted price, quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation models may be used to determine fair value.\n\nFor rabbi trust assets, pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning fund assets, published trading data and pricing models, generally  using  the  most  observable  inputs  available,  are  utilized  to determine fair value for each security.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for further information.\n\nDerivative  Instruments -  Xcel  Energy  uses  derivative  instruments  in connection  with  its  commodity  trading  activities,  and  to  manage  risk associated  with  changes  in  interest  rates  and  utility  commodity  prices, including  forward  contracts,  futures,  swaps  and  options.  Derivatives  not qualifying  for  the  normal  purchases  and  normal  sales  exception  are recorded  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  at  fair  value  as  derivative instruments.  Classification  of  changes  in  fair  value  for  those  derivative instruments  is  dependent  on  the  designation  of  a  qualifying  hedging relationship.\n\nChanges  in  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  not  designated  in  a qualifying  hedging  relationship  are  reflected  in  current  earnings  or  as  a regulatory asset or liability. Classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nGains  or  losses  on  commodity  trading  transactions  are  recorded  as  a component of electric operating revenues.\n\nNormal  Purchases  and  Normal  Sales -  Xcel  Energy  enters  into contracts for purchases and sales of commodities for use in its operations. At inception, contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a derivative,  and  if  so,  whether  they  may  be  exempted  from  derivative accounting if designated as normal purchases or normal sales.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.",

        "page_content": "Commodity  Trading  Operations -  All  applicable  gains  and  losses related to commodity trading activities are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nCommodity trading activities are not associated with energy produced from generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity  trading  contracts  are  recorded  at  fair  market  value  and commodity  trading  results  include  the  impact  of  all  margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\n## Other Utility Items\n\nAFUDC -AFUDC  represents  the  cost  of  capital  used  to  finance  utility construction  activity  and  is  computed  by  applying  a  composite  financing rate  to  qualified  CWIP.  The  amount  of  AFUDC  capitalized  as  a  utility construction  cost  is  credited  to  other  nonoperating  income  (for  equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy's rate base.\n\nAlternative  Revenue -  Certain  rate  rider  mechanisms  (including decoupling/sales  true  up  and  CIP/DSM  programs)  qualify  as  alternative revenue programs. These mechanisms arise from instances in which the regulator  authorizes  a  future  surcharge  in  response  to  past  activities  or completed  events.  When  certain  criteria  are  met,  including  expected collection  within  24  months,  revenue  is  recognized,  which  may  include incentives and return on rate base items.\n\nBilling  amounts  are  revised  periodically  for  differences  between  total amount collected and revenue earned, which may increase or decrease the level  of  revenue  collected  from  customers.  Alternative  revenues  arising from  these  programs  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\n## See Note 6 for further information.\n\nConservation Programs -Costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred  if  it  is  probable  future  revenue  will  recover  the  incurred  cost. Revenues  recognized  for  incentive  programs  for  the  recovery  of  lost margins and/or conservation performance incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the year they are earned. Regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been collected from customers.\n\nEmissions  Allowances -Emissions  allowances  are  recorded  at  cost, including  broker  commission  fees.  The  inventory  accounting  model  is utilized for all emissions allowances and any sales of these allowances are included in electric revenues.\n\nNuclear  Refueling  Outage  Costs -  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  deferral  and amortization  method  for  nuclear  refueling  costs.  This  method  amortizes costs  over  the  period  between  refueling  outages  consistent  with  rate recovery.\n\nRECs -Cost  of  RECs  that  are  utilized  for  compliance  is  recorded  as electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expense.  In  certain  jurisdictions,  Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel and purchased power costs for the cost of RECs received.\n\nAn inventory accounting model is used to account for RECs, however these assets  are  classified  as  regulatory  assets  if  amounts  are  recoverable  in future rates.\n\nSales of RECs are recorded in electric revenues on a gross basis. The cost of  these  RECs  and  amounts  credited  to  customers  under  margin-sharing mechanisms are recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.\n\nCost of RECs that are utilized to support commodity trading activities are recorded  in  a  similar  manner  as  the  associated  commodities  and  are presented on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## 2.   Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Issued\n\nSegment Reporting -In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which extends the existing requirements for annual disclosures  to  quarterly  periods,  and  requires  that  both  annual  and quarterly disclosures present segment expenses using line items consistent with  information  regularly  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision  maker. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2023 and quarterly periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, and Xcel Energy does not expect implementation of the new disclosure guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIncome  Taxes -In  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2023-09 -Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , with new disclosure requirements including presentation of prescribed line items in  the  effective tax rate reconciliation and disclosures regarding state and local tax payments. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, and Xcel Energy does not expect implementation of the new disclosure guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.

Xcel  Energy  would  be  required  to  recognize  the  write-off  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  in  net  income  or  other comprehensive income if changes in the utility industry no longer allow for the application of regulatory accounting guidance under GAAP.\n\n## Components of regulatory assets:\n\nRemaining Amortization\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                   | See Note(s)   | Period                   | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2022 (a)   | Dec. 31, 2022 (a)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Regulatory Assets                                       |               |                          | Current         | Noncurrent      | Current             | Noncurrent          |\n| Pension and retiree medical obligations                 | 11            | Various                  | $  27           | $  1,106        | $  22               | $  1,069            |\n| Recoverable deferred taxes on AFUDC                     |               | Plant lives              | -               | 332             | -                   | 292                 |\n| Net AROs  (b)                                           | 1, 12         | Various                  | -               | 316             | -                   | 339                 |\n| Excess deferred taxes - TCJA                            | 7             | Various                  | 10              | 198             | 13                  | 205                 |\n| Depreciation differences                                |               | One to 12 years          | 17              | 189             | 17                  | 193                 |\n| Environmental remediation costs                         | 1, 12         | Various                  | 15              | 94              | 20                  | 92                  |\n| Deferred natural gas, electric, steam energy/fuel costs |               | One to three years       | 239             | 80              | 581                 | 299                 |\n| Conservation programs  (c)                              | 1             | One to two years         | 19              | 54              | 16                  | 36                  |\n| Purchased power contract costs                          |               | Term of related contract | 4               | 40              | 10                  | 36                  |\n| PI extended power uprate                                |               | 11 years                 | 4               | 38              | 4                   | 42                  |\n| Benson biomass PPA termination and asset purchase       |               | Five years               | 10              | 36              | 10                  | 45                  |\n| Sales true-up and revenue decoupling                    |               | One to two years         | 7               | 33              | 54                  | -                   |\n| State commission adjustments                            |               | Plant lives              | 1               | 32              | 1                   | 33                  |\n| Losses on reacquired debt                               |               | Term of related debt     | 2               | 30              | 3                   | 32                  |\n| MISO capacity revenue tracker                           |               | One to two years         | 36              | 26              | -                   | -                   |\n| Gas pipeline inspection and remediation costs           |               | One to two years         | 40              | 25              | 42                  | 13                  |\n| Contract valuation adjustments  (d)                     | 1, 10         | Term of related contract | 18              | 22              | 28                  | 28                  |\n| Nuclear refueling outage costs                          | 1             | One to two years         | 43              | 19              | 30                  | 12                  |\n| Grid modernization costs                                |               | One to two years         | 16              | 17              | 14                  | 24                  |\n| Renewable resources and environmental initiatives       |               | One to two years         | 38              | 5               | 50                  | 6                   |\n| Other                                                   |               | Various                  | 65              | 106             | 144                 | 75                  |\n| Total regulatory assets                                 |               |                          | $  611          | $  2,798        | $  1,059            | $  2,871            |",

The credit agreement is limited in use to support letters of credit.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, NSP-Minnesota had $65 million outstanding letters of credit under the $75 million Bilateral Credit Agreement.\n\nLetters of Credit - Xcel Energy uses letters of credit, typically with terms of one  year,  to  provide  financial  guarantees  for  certain  operating obligations. As of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $44 million and $43 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities, respectively. Amounts approximate their fair value.\n\nCredit  Facilities -In  order  to  use  commercial  paper  programs  to  fulfill short-term funding needs, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries must have revolving credit facilities in place at least equal to the amount of their respective commercial paper borrowing limits and cannot issue commercial paper exceeding available capacity under these credit facilities.\n\nThe lines of credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to  banks,  letters  of  credit  and  back-up  support  for  commercial  paper borrowings.\n\nTerms of Credit Agreements -In September 2022 , Xcel Energy Inc., NSPMinnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each entered into an amended five-year  credit  agreement  with  a  syndicate  of  banks.  The  aggregate borrowing limit is $3.55 billion. The amended credit agreements mature in September 2027.",

Share-Based Compensation\n\nIncentive  Plan  Including  Share-Based  Compensation -  Xcel  Energy has  authorized  7.0  million  equity  shares  under  an  incentive  plan  (the Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan).\n\nEquity  Awards -  Xcel  Energy's  Board  of  Directors  has  granted  equity awards  under  the  2015  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan,  which  includes  various vesting  conditions  and  performance  goals.  At  the  end  of  the  restricted period, such  grants  will  be  awarded  if  vesting  conditions  and/or performance goals are met.\n\nCertain employees are granted equity awards with a portion subject only to service conditions, and the other portion subject to performance conditions. The  total  time-based  equity  shares  granted  subject  only  to  service conditions  was  0.4  million  in  2023  and  0.2  million  in  2022  and  2021 respectively.\n\nThe performance conditions for a portion of the awards granted from 2021 to 2023 are based on relative TSR and environmental goals. Equity awards with performance conditions will be settled after three years, with payouts ranging from zero to 200% depending on achievement.\n\nEquity award units granted to employees:\n\n| (Units in Thousands)                    | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Granted units                           | 586      | 395      | 421      |\n| Weighted average grant date  fair value | $  67.06 | $  68.43 | $  66.03 |",

This  plan  allows Xcel  Energy  to  attach  various  performance  goals  to  the  awards  granted. The  liability  awards  have  been  historically  dependent  on  relative  TSR measured over a three-year period. Xcel Energy Inc.'s TSR is compared to a  peer  group  of  other  utility  companies.

Equity  awards  have  not  been  previously  settled  in  cash  and Xcel  Energy  plans  to  continue  electing  share  settlement.  Grant  date  fair value of equity awards is expensed over the service period.\n\nTSR liability awards are accounted for as liabilities, as historically they are partially settled in cash. As liability awards, the fair value on which ratable expense  is  based,  as  employees  vest  in  their  rights  to  those  awards,  is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the market value of the award on the date the settlement date.\n\nCompensation costs related to share-based awards:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost for share-based awards  (a) | $  27  | $  36  | $  31  |\n| Tax benefit recognized in income | 7      | 9      | 8      |\n\nThere was approximately $38 million and $37 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested  share-based  compensation  awards.  Xcel  Energy  expects  to recognize the unrecognized amount over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\n\n## 9.   Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic  EPS  was  computed  by  dividing  the  earnings  available  to  common shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares outstanding. Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to  common  shareholders  by  the  diluted  weighted  average  number  of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially  dilutive  shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nCommon  Stock  Equivalents -  Common  stock  equivalents  include commitments  to  issue  common  stock  related  to  time-based  equity compensation awards.\n\nStock  equivalent  units  granted  to  Xcel  Energy's  Board  of  Directors  are included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon  grant  date  as  there  is  no further  service,  performance  or  market  condition  following  the  grant  of these  awards.  Restricted  stock  issued  to  employees  under  the  Executive Annual  Incentive  Award  Plan  is  included  in  common  shares  outstanding when granted.\n\nShare-based  compensation  arrangements  for  which  there  is  currently  no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  included  in common  shares  outstanding  when  all  necessary  conditions  for settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Liability  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  any  portions settled  in  shares  are  included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon settlement.",

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nAccounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a  hierarchical  framework  for  disclosing  the  observability  of  the  inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 -Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities  included  in  Level  1  are  actively  traded  instruments  with observable actual trading prices.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 -Pricing inputs are other than actual trading prices in active markets  but  are  either  directly  or  indirectly  observable  as  of  the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are  typically  either  comparable  to  actively  traded  securities  or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 -Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of  the  reporting  date.  The  types  of  assets  and  liabilities  included  in Level  3  include  those  valued  with  models  requiring  significant judgment or estimation.\n\nSpecific valuation methods include:\n\nInvestments  in  equity  securities  and  other  funds -Equity  securities are  valued  using  quoted  prices  in  active  markets.  The  fair  values  for commingled  funds  are  measured  using  NAVs.  The  investments  in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice. Private equity commingled funds require approval of the fund for any unscheduled redemption, and such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion. Unscheduled  distributions  from  real  estate commingled  funds  may  be  redeemed  with  proper  notice,  however, withdrawals may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.\n\nInvestments  in  debt  securities -Fair  values  for  debt  securities  are determined  by  a  third  party  pricing  service  using  recent  trades  and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.\n\nInterest  rate  derivatives -Fair  values  of  interest  rate  derivatives  are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts.\n\nCommodity  derivatives -Methods  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of commodity  derivative  forwards  and  options  utilize  forward  prices  and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are  generally  assigned  a  Level  2  classification.  When  contracts  relate  to inactive  delivery  locations  or  extend  to  periods  beyond  those  readily observable  on  active  exchanges,  the  significance  of  the  use  of  less observable  inputs  on  a  valuation  is  evaluated  and  may  result  in  Level  3 classification.\n\nElectric  commodity  derivatives  held  by  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS  include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as FTRs. FTRs purchased from an RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.\n\nThe values of these instruments are derived from, and designed to offset, the  costs  of  transmission  congestion.  In  addition  to  overall  transmission load,  congestion  is  also  influenced  by  the  operating  schedules  of  power plants and the consumption of electricity pertinent to a given transmission path. Unplanned plant outages, scheduled plant maintenance, changes in the relative costs of fuels used in generation, weather and overall changes in  demand for  electricity  can  each  impact  the  operating  schedules  of  the power plants on the transmission grid and the value of these instruments.\n\nFTRs  are  recognized  at  fair  value  and  adjusted  each  period  prior  to settlement.  Given  the  limited  observability  of  certain  variables  underlying the reported auction values of FTRs, these fair value measurements have been assigned a Level 3 classification.\n\nNet congestion costs, including the impact of FTR settlements, are shared through  fuel  and  purchased  energy  cost  recovery  mechanisms.  As  such, the fair value of the unsettled instruments (i.e., derivative asset or liability) is offset/deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\n\n## Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning Fund\n\nThe NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants. Assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning these facilities. The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities,  equity  securities  and  other  investments.  NSP-Minnesota  uses the  MPUC  approved  asset  allocation  for  the  investment  targets  by  asset class for the qualified trust.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning over the lives of the nuclear plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs. Realized and  unrealized  gains  on  fund  investments  over  the  life  of  the  fund  are deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSP-Minnesota's  regulatory  asset  for  nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset.\n\nUnrealized  gains  for  the  nuclear  decommissioning  fund  were  $1.2  billion and $1.0 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and unrealized losses  were  $29  million  and  $90  million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022, respectively.\n\nNon-derivative  instruments  with  recurring  fair  value  measurements  in  the nuclear decommissioning fund:\n\n|                                   | Dec. 31, 2023                     | Dec. 31, 2023                     | Dec. 31, 2023                     | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   |                                   | Fair Value                        | Fair Value                        | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Cost                              | Level 1                           | Level 2                           | Level 3         | NAV             | Total           |\n| Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cash equivalents                  | $  41                             | $  41                             | $  -                              | $  -            | $  -            | $  41           |\n| Commingled funds                  | 721                               | -                                 | -                                 | -               | 1,049           | 1,049           |\n| Debt securities                   | 784                               | -                                 | 771                               | 9               | -               | 780             |\n| Equity securities                 | 508                               | 1,339                             | 2                                 | -               | -               | 1,341           |\n| Total                             | $  2,054                          | $  1,380                          | $  773                            | $  9            | $  1,049        | $  3,211        |",

The fair value of assets held in the rabbi trusts were $88 million and $80 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,  comprised  of  cash  equivalents  and  mutual  funds  (level  1 valuation  methods).  Amounts  are  reported  in  nuclear  decommissioning fund and other investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Derivative Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n\nXcel Energy enters into derivative instruments, including forward contracts, futures,  swaps  and  options,  for  trading  purposes  and  to  manage  risk  in connection with changes in interest rates, and utility commodity prices.\n\nInterest  Rate  Derivatives -Xcel  Energy  enters  into  contracts  that effectively  fix  the  interest  rate  on  a  specified  principal  amount  of  a hypothetical future debt issuance. These financial swaps net settle based on  changes in  a  specified  benchmark  interest  rate,  acting  as  a  hedge  of changes in market interest rates that will impact specified anticipated debt issuances.  These  derivative  instruments  are  designated  as  cash  flow hedges  for  accounting  purposes,  with  changes  in  fair  value  prior  to occurrence  of  the  hedged  transactions  recorded  as  other  comprehensive income.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2023,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  related  to interest  rate  derivatives  included  $2  million  of  net  losses  expected  to  be reclassified  into  earnings  during  the  next  12  months  as  the  hedged transactions  impact  earnings.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2023,  Xcel  Energy  had unsettled interest swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $420 million. These interest rate derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\nSee Note 13 for  the  financial  impact  of  qualifying  interest  rate  cash  flow hedges on Xcel Energy's accumulated other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated statements of common stockholder's equity and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading -Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility subsidiaries  conduct  various  wholesale  and  commodity  trading  activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Xcel Energy  is  allowed  to  conduct  these  activities  within  guidelines  and limitations  as  approved  by  its  risk  management  committee,  comprised  of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  for  trading  purposes  are  presented  in the  consolidated  statements  of  income  as  electric  revenues,  net  of  any sharing  with  customers.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  mitigate commodity  price  risk  associated  with  regulated  electric  and  natural  gas operations. Sharing of these margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC-approved joint operating agreement.\n\nCommodity Derivatives -Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to  manage  variability  of  future  cash  flows  from  changes  in  commodity prices  in  its  electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  This  could  include  the purchase  or  sale  of  energy  or  energy-related  products,  natural  gas  to generate electric energy, natural gas for resale and FTRs.\n\nThe most significant derivative positions outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022 for this purpose relate to FTR instruments administered by MISO and SPP. These instruments are intended to offset the impacts of transmission system congestion.\n\nHigher congestion costs in recent years have led to an increase in the fair value  of  FTRs.  Settlements  of  FTRs  are  shared  with  electric  customers through fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms.\n\nWhen  Xcel  Energy  enters  into  derivative  instruments  that  mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers, the instruments are not typically designated as qualifying hedging transactions. The classification of unrealized losses or gains on these instruments as a regulatory asset or liability, if applicable, is based on approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nGross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs:\n\n(a)(b)\n\n| (Amounts in Millions)   |   Dec. 31, 2023 |   Dec. 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| MWh of electricity      |              48 |              61 |\n| MMBtu of natural gas    |              84 |             131 |\n\nConsideration  of  Credit  Risk  and  Concentrations -Xcel  Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in  the  contracts.  Impact  of  credit  risk  was  immaterial  to  the  fair  value  of unsettled  commodity  derivatives  presented  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nXcel  Energy's  utility  subsidiaries'  most  significant  concentrations  of  credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.",

        "page_content": "As  of  Dec.  31,  2023,  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  ten  most  significant counterparties  for  these  activities,  comprising  $49  million  or  23%  of  this credit  exposure,  had  investment  grade  credit  ratings  from  S&P  Global Ratings, Moody's Investor Services or Fitch Ratings.\n\nFive  of  the  ten  most  significant  counterparties,  comprising  $78  million  or 37%  of  this  credit  exposure,  were  not  rated  by  these  external  ratings agencies, but based on Xcel Energy's internal analysis, had credit quality consistent with investment grade.\n\nOne of these significant counterparties, comprising $45 million or 21% of this credit exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on internal analysis.\n\nEight  of  these  significant  counterparties  are  municipal  or  cooperative electric entities, RTOs or other utilities.\n\nCredit Related Contingent Features - Contract provisions for derivative instruments that the utility subsidiaries enter, including those accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale contracts and therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if the applicable utility subsidiary's credit ratings are downgraded below its investment grade credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022,  there  were  $12  million  and  $4  million, respectively, of derivative liabilities with such  underlying contract provisions, respectively.\n\nAlso,  certain  contracts  may  contain  cross  default  provisions  that  may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts if there was a failure  under  other  financing  arrangements  related  to  payment  terms  or other covenants.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were approximately $88 million and $76 million of derivative liabilities with such underlying contract provisions, respectively.\n\nCertain derivative  instruments  are  also  subject  to  contract  provisions  that contain adequate assurance clauses. These provisions allow counterparties to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the  event  that  a  given  utility  subsidiary's  ability  to  fulfill  its  contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  no  collateral  posted  related  to  adequate  assurance clauses in derivative contracts as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Recurring Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\nImpact of derivative activity:\n\n|                                            | Pre-Tax Fair Value Gains (Losses) Recognized  During the Period in:   | Pre-Tax Fair Value Gains (Losses) Recognized  During the Period in:   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                      | Accumulated Other  Comprehensive Loss                                 | Regulatory (Assets) and  Liabilities                                  |\n| Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023                   |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges | Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges                            |                                                                       |\n| Interest rate                              | (2)                                                                   | $  -

Fair  value  estimates  are  based  on  information  available  to management as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, and given the observability of the inputs, fair values presented for long-term debt were assigned as Level 2.\n\n## 11.   Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits\n\nXcel Energy has several noncontributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees. All newly hired or rehired employees participate under the Cash Balance formula, which is based on pay credits using a percentage of annual eligible pay and annual interest credits.\n\nThe average annual interest crediting rates for these plans was 4.72, 4.89 and 2.03% in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\nSome  employees  may  participate  under  legacy  formulas  such  as  the traditional  final  average  pay  or  pension  equity.  Xcel  Energy's  policy  is  to fully  fund  into  an  external  trust  the  actuarially  determined  pension  costs subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.\n\nIn addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and  a  nonqualified  pension  plan.  The  SERP  is  maintained  for  certain executives  who  participated  in  the  plan  in  2008,  when  the  SERP  was closed to new participants.\n\nThe nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess  of  the  limits  applicable  to  the  qualified  pension  plans,  with distributions funded by Xcel Energy's consolidated operating cash flows.\n\nObligations  of  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plan  as  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and 2022  were  $12  million  and  $11  million,  respectively.  Xcel  Energy recognized  net  benefit  cost  for  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plans  of  $2 million in 2023 and $17 million in 2022.\n\nXcel Energy's postretirement health care benefit plan is a continuation of certain  welfare  benefit  programs  for  current  employees.  A  full  time employee's date of hire or a retiree's date of retirement determine eligibility for each of the programs.\n\nXcel Energy's investment-return assumption considers the expected longterm  performance  for  each  of  the  asset  classes  in  its  pension  and postretirement  health  care  portfolio.  Xcel  Energy  considers  the  historical returns achieved by its asset portfolios over long time periods, as well as the long-term projected return levels from investment experts.\n\nPension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.\n\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2023 were above the assumed level of 6.93%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2022 were below the assumed level of 6.49%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2021 were above the assumed level of 6.49%.\n- \u00b7 In 2024, expected investment-return assumption is 6.93%.\n\nPension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy's return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk.\n\nThe  principal  mechanism  for  achieving  these  objectives  is  the  asset allocation  given  the  long-term  risk,  return,  correlation  and  liquidity characteristics of each particular asset class.\n\nThere were no significant concentrations of risk in any industry, index, or entity.  Market  volatility  can  impact  even  well-diversified  portfolios  and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year.\n\nState agencies also have issued guidelines to the funding of postretirement benefit  costs.  SPS  is  required  to  fund  postretirement  benefit  plans  for Texas and New Mexico equal to amounts collected in rates. These assets are  invested  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  investment  strategy  for  the pension plan.\n\nXcel  Energy's  ongoing  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investment  recommendations  that  seek  to  minimize  potential  investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time.\n\nThe  investment  recommendations  consider  many  factors  and  generally result in a greater percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets  being  allocated  to  plans  having relatively lower funded status ratios.",

These unfunded obligations are presented in other current liabilities and noncurrent pension and employee benefit obligations in the consolidated balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\n| Significant Assumptions to Measure Benefit Obligations:    | 2023     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Discount rate for year-end valuation                       | 5.50 %   |\n| Mortality table                                            | PRI-2012 |\n| Health care costs trend rate and ultimate trend assumption | 7.00 %   |\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  401(k)  and  other  defined  contribution  plans  that cover most employees. Total expense to these plans was approximately\n\n$49 million in 2023, $46 million in 2022 and $43 million in 2021.\n\n## Multiemployer Plans\n\nNSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  each  contribute  to  several  union multiemployer  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans,  none  of which  are  individually  significant.  These  plans  provide  pension  and postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  certain  union  employees  who  may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSPMinnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  pension  and  postretirement health care plans.\n\nContributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits  under  NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  plans,  in that if another  participating employer  ceases  to  contribute  to  a multiemployer pension plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers.\n\n## 12.   Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal\n\nXcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable estimation.\n\nManagement  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an  amount  or  range  of  a reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations,  including  but  not  limited  to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.\n\nIn  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate  resolution,  including  a  possible  eventual  loss.  For  current proceedings  not  specifically  reported  herein,  management  does  not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred.",

        "page_content": "Gas Trading Litigation -e  prime  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Xcel Energy. e prime was in the business of natural gas trading and marketing but  has  not  engaged  in  natural  gas  trading  or  marketing  activities  since 2003.  Multiple  lawsuits  involving  multiple  plaintiffs  seeking  monetary damages were commenced against e prime and its affiliates, including Xcel Energy,  between  2003  and  2009  alleging  fraud  and  anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices. Cases were all consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.\n\nOne  case  remains  active  which  includes  a  multi-district  litigation  matter consisting  of  a  Wisconsin  purported  class  (Arandell  Corp.).  The  Court issued a ruling in June 2022 granting plaintiffs' class certification. In April 2023, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals heard the defendants' appeal challenging whether the district court properly assessed class certification. A  decision  relating  to  class  certification  is  expected  imminently.  Xcel Energy considers the reasonably possible loss associated with this litigation to be immaterial.\n\nComanche Unit 3 Litigation -In 2021, CORE filed a lawsuit in Denver County District Court, alleging PSCo breached ownership agreement terms by  failing  to  operate  Comanche  Unit  3  in  accordance  with  prudent  utility practices.  In  April  2022,  CORE  filed  a  supplement  to  include  damages related  to  a  2022  outage.  Also  in  2022,  CORE  sent  notice  of  withdrawal from the ownership agreement based on the same alleged breaches.\n\nIn February 2023, the court granted PSCo's motion precluding CORE from seeking damages related to its withdrawal as part of the lawsuit. In October 2023, the jury ruled that CORE may not withdraw as a joint owner of the facility  but  awarded  CORE  lost  power  damages  of  $26  million.  PSCo recognized a $34 million  loss  for  the  verdict  in  the  third  quarter  of  2023, including estimated interest and other costs. PSCo intends to file an appeal of this decision.\n\nMarshall  Wildfire  Litigation -In  December  2021,  a  wildfire  ignited  in Boulder  County,  Colorado  (the  'Marshall  Fire'),  which  burned  over  6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County Sheriff's Office released its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary  and  Review  and  its  supporting  documents  (the  'Sheriff's Report').  According  to  an  October  2022  statement  from  the  Colorado Insurance  Commissioner,  the  Marshall  Fire  is  estimated  to  have  caused more than $2 billion in property losses.\n\nAccording  to  the  Sheriff's  Report,  on  Dec.  30,  2021,  a  fire  ignited  on  a residential  property  in  Boulder,  Colorado,  located  in  PSCo's  service territory,  for  reasons  unrelated  to  PSCo's  power  lines.  According  to  the Sheriff's  Report,  approximately  one  hour  and  20  minutes  after  the  first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa Trailhead in unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo's service territory.  According  to  the  Sheriff's  Report,  the  second  ignition  started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo's power lines in the area.\n\nThe  Sheriff's  Report  states  that  the  most  probable  cause  of  the  second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo's power lines after one of the  power  lines  detached  from  its  insulator  in  strong  winds,  and  further states that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground  coal  fire.  According  to  the  Sheriff's  Report,  no  design, installation  or  maintenance  defects  or  deficiencies  were  identified  on PSCo's electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. PSCo disputes that its power lines caused the second ignition .\n\nPSCo is aware of 302 complaints,  most  of  which  have  also  named  Xcel Energy  Inc.  and  Xcel  Energy  Services,  Inc.  as  additional  defendants, relating to the Marshall Fire. The complaints are on behalf of at least 4,047 plaintiffs,  and  one  complaint  is  filed  on  behalf  of  a  putative  class  of  first responders  who  allegedly  were  exposed  to  the  threat  of  serious  bodily injury,  or  smoke,  soot  and  ash  from  the  Marshall  Fire.  The  complaints generally allege that PSCo's equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various  causes  of  action  under  Colorado  law,  including  negligence, premises  liability,  trespass,  nuisance,  wrongful  death,  willful  and  wanton conduct,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  loss  of  consortium  and inverse  condemnation.  In  addition  to  seeking  compensatory  damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages.\n\nIn September 2023, the Boulder County District Court Judge consolidated eight lawsuits that were pending at that time into a single action for pretrial purposes and has subsequently consolidated additional lawsuits that have been filed. At the case management conference in February 2024, a trial date was set for September 2025.\n\nColorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company's  liability  for  fire-related  damages.  For  inverse  condemnation claims,  Colorado  courts  assess  whether  a  defendant  acted  with  intent  to take  a  plaintiff's  property  or  intentionally  took  an  action  which  has  the natural  consequence  of  taking  the  property.  For  negligence  claims, Colorado courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their  system  with  a  heightened  duty  of  care  consistent  with  the  practical conduct of  its  business,  and  liability  does  not  extend  to  occurrences  that cannot be reasonably anticipated.\n\nColorado  law  does  not  impose  joint  and  several  liability  in  tort  actions. Instead,  under  Colorado  law,  a  defendant  is  liable  for  the  degree  or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury's verdict in a Colorado  civil  case  must  be  unanimous.  Under  Colorado  law,  in  a  civil action  other  than  a  medical  malpractice  action,  the  total  award  for noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million per defendant for claims that accrued at the time of the Marshall Fire unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the maximum doubles.\n\nColorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted  in  a  willful  and  wanton  manner  during  the  action  which  further aggravated plaintiff's damages.\n\nIn  the  event  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  or  PSCo  was  found  liable  related  to  this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent and  magnitude  of  potential  damages,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  PSCo  are unable to  estimate  the  amount  or  range  of  possible  losses  in  connection with the Marshall Fire.",

        "page_content": "## Rate Matters and Other\n\nXcel  Energy's  operating  subsidiaries  are  involved  in  various  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Until  resolution, typically in the form of a rate order, uncertainties may exist regarding the ultimate rate treatment for certain activities and transactions. Amounts have been  recognized  for  probable  and  reasonably  estimable  losses  that  may result. Unless otherwise disclosed, any reasonably possible range of loss in excess of any recognized amount is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSherco -In 2018, NSP-Minnesota and SMMPA (Co-owner of Sherco Unit 3) reached a settlement with GE related to a 2011 incident, which damaged the  turbine  at  Sherco  Unit  3  and  resulted  in  an  extended  outage.  NSPMinnesota notified the MPUC of its proposal to refund settlement proceeds to customers through the FCA.\n\nIn  March  2019,  the  MPUC  approved  NSP-Minnesota's  settlement  refund proposal.  Additionally,  the  MPUC  decided  to  withhold  any  decision  as  to NSP-Minnesota's prudence in connection with the incident at Sherco Unit 3 until  after  conclusion  of  an  appeal  pending  between  GE  and  NSPMinnesota's  insurers.  In  February  2020,  the  Minnesota  Court  of  Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of GE.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  OAG  and  DOC  recommended  that  NSP-Minnesota refund  approximately  $17  million  of  replacement  power  costs  previously recovered  through  the  FCA.  NSP-Minnesota  responded  that  it  acted prudently  in  connection  with  the  Sherco  Unit  3  outage,  the  MPUC  has previously disallowed $22 million of related costs and no additional refund or disallowance is appropriate.\n\nIn July 2022, the MPUC referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings to conduct a contested case on the prudence of the replacement power  costs  incurred  by  NSP-Minnesota.  In  2023,  NSP-Minnesota  and various parties filed recommendations,  including the DOC  which recommended  a  $56  million  customer  refund.  The  Xcel  Large  Industrial customer group recommended a refund of $72 million. A final decision by the MPUC is expected in mid-2024. A loss related to this matter is deemed remote.\n\nMISO  ROE  Complaints -  In  November  2013  and  February  2015, customer  groups  filed  two  ROE  complaints  against  MISO  TOs,  which includes NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin.  The  first complaint requested  a  reduction  in  base  ROE  transmission  formula  rates  from 12.38% to 9.15% for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from 12.38% to 8.67%.\n\nThe  FERC  subsequently  issued  various  related  orders  related  to  ROE methodology/calculations  and  timing.  NSP-Minnesota  has  processed refunds to customers for applicable complaint periods based on the ROE in the most recent applicable opinions.\n\nThe MISO TOs and various other parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's most recent applicable opinions at the D.C. Circuit. In August 2022,  the  D.C.  Circuit  ruled  that  FERC  had  not  adequately  supported  its conclusions, vacated FERC's related orders and remanded the issue back to  FERC  for  further  proceedings,  which  remain  pending.  Additional exposure, if any related to this matter is expected to be immaterial.\n\n## Environmental\n\nNew and changing federal and state environmental mandates can create financial  liabilities  for  Xcel  Energy,  which  are  normally  recovered  through the regulated rate process.\n\n## Site Remediation\n\nVarious  federal  and  state  environmental  laws  impose  liability  where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment. Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a  portion  of  the  cost  to  remediate  sites  where  past  activities  of  their predecessors or other parties have caused environmental contamination.\n\nEnvironmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former MGPs; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries are alleged to have sent wastes to that site.\n\n## MGP, Landfill and Disposal Sites\n\nXcel Energy is investigating, remediating or performing post-closure actions at  12  historical  MGP,  landfill  or  other  disposal  sites  across  its  service territories, excluding sites that are being addressed under current coal ash regulations (see below).\n\nXcel  Energy  has  recognized  approximately  $20  million  of  costs/liabilities from final resolution of these issues; however, the outcome and timing are unknown.  In  addition,  there  may  be  insurance  recovery  and/or  recovery from  other  potentially  responsible  parties,  offsetting  a  portion  of  costs incurred.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Water and Waste\n\nCoal Ash Regulation -Xcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state regulations that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and  disposal  of  solid  waste,  including  the  CCR  Rule.  As  a  specific requirement of the CCR Rule, utilities must complete groundwater sampling around  their  applicable  landfills  and  surface  impoundments  as  well  as perform corrective actions where offsite groundwater has been impacted.\n\nIf  certain  impacts  to  groundwater  are  detected,  utilities  are  required  to perform  additional  groundwater  investigations  and/or  perform  corrective actions beginning with an Assessment of Corrective Measures.\n\nInvestigation  and/or  corrective  action  related  to  groundwater  impacts  are currently  underway  at  four  Xcel  Energy  sites  under  the  federal  CCR program at a current estimated cost of at least $40 million. A liability has been recorded and is expected to be fully recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nFor required coal ash disposal, PSCo has executed an agreement with a third  party  that  will  excavate  and  process  ash  for  beneficial  use  (at  two sites) at a cost of approximately $45 million. An estimated liability has been recorded  and  amounts  are  expected  to  be  fully  recoverable  through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nFederal Clean Water Act Section 316(b) - The Federal Clean Water Act requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure they reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  impingement  and entrainment of aquatic species.\n\nEstimated  capital  expenditures  of  approximately  $50  million  may  be required  to  comply  with  the  requirements.  Xcel  Energy  anticipates  these costs will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental Requirements -Air\n\nClean  Air  Act  NOx  Allowance  Allocations  In  June  2023,  the  EPA published final regulations for ozone under the 'Good Neighbor' provisions of  the  Clean  Air  Act.  The  final  rule  applies  to  generation  facilities  in Minnesota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin,  as  well  as  other  states  outside  of  our service  territory.  The  rule  establishes  an  allowance  trading  program  for NOx that will impact subject Xcel Energy fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. Subject facilities will have to secure additional allowances, install NOx  controls  and/or  develop  a  strategy  of  operations  that  utilizes  the existing allowance  allocations.  Guidelines  are  also  established  for allowance banking and emission limit backstops.\n\nWhile the financial impacts of the final rule are uncertain and dependent on market  forces  and  anticipated  generation,  Xcel  Energy  anticipates  the annual  costs  could  be  significant,  but  would  be  recoverable  through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nSPS  and  NSP-Minnesota  have  joined  other  companies  in  litigation challenging  the  EPA's  disapproval  of  Texas  and  Minnesota  state implementation plans. Currently, the regulation is under a judicial stay for both Texas and Minnesota. The regulation may become applicable in those states in the future, depending on the outcome of the litigation. The rule is in  effect  in  NSP-Wisconsin  but  has  been  managed  without  the  additional need for allowances.\n\nIn February 2024, the EPA proposed to partially disapprove New Mexico's state  implementation  plan  and  bring  New  Mexico  into  the  federal  Good Neighbor  plan.  Xcel  Energy  continues  to  evaluate  impacts  to  generation units at SPS.\n\nRegional Haze Rules - The EPA has proposed rules addressing Regional Haze  compliance  in  Texas,  which  address  requirements  for  reasonable progress at Tolk and BART at Harrington. As proposed, these rules would not require additional controls at either facility, in part due to the conversion of  Harrington  to  gas  in  2025  and  the  planned  retirement  of  Tolk.  These rules will be monitored until final versions are published.\n\nAROs - AROs have been recorded for Xcel Energy's assets. For nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants.\n\nAggregate  fair  value  of  NSP-Minnesota's  legally  restricted  assets,  for funding future nuclear decommissioning was $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nXcel Energy's AROs were as follows:\n\n| (Millions  of Dollars)              | Jan. 1,  2023   | Amounts  Incurred (a)   | Amounts  Settled   | Accretion   | Cash  Flow  Revisions (b)   | Dec.  31,  2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Electric                            |                 |                         |                    |             |                             |                   |\n| Nuclear                             | $  2,160        | $  -                    | $  -               | $  105      | $  (158)                    | $  2,107          |\n| Wind                                | 514             | 10                      | -                  | 19          | (17)                        | 526               |\n| Steam, hydro  and other  production | 348             | -                       | (1)                | 15          | (1)                         | 361               |\n| Distribution                        | 48              | -                       | -                  | 1           | -                           | 49                |\n| Natural gas                         |                 |                         |                    |             |                             |                   |\n| Transmission  and  distribution     | 307             | -                       |                    | 14          | (149)                       | 172               |\n| Other                               |                 |                         |                    |             |                             |                   |\n| Miscellaneous                       | 3               | -                       | -                  | -           | -                           | 3                 |\n| Total  liability                    | $  3,380        | $  10                   | $  (1)             | $  154      | $  (325)                    | $  3,218          |\n\n| (Millions  of Dollars)              | Jan. 1,  2022   | Amounts  Incurred (a)   | Accretion   | Cash Flow  Revisions (b)   | Dec. 31,  2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| Electric                            |                 |                         |             |                            |                  |\n| Nuclear                             | $  2,056        | $  -                    | $  104      | $  -                       | $  2,160         |\n| Wind                                | 478             | 25                      | 19          | (8)                        | 514              |\n| Steam, hydro and  other production  | 288             | 34                      | 12          | 14                         | 348              |\n| Distribution                        | 47              | -                       | 1           | -                          | 48               |\n| Natural gas                         |                 |                         |             |                            |                  |\n| Transmission and  distribution  (c) | 279             | -                       | 12          | 16                         | 307              |\n| Other                               |                 |                         |             |                            |                  |\n| Miscellaneous                       | 3               | -                       | -           | -                          | 3                |\n| Total liability                     | $  3,151        | $  59                   | $  148      | $  22                      | $  3,380         |\n\nIndeterminate  AROs -Outside  of  the  recorded  asbestos  AROs,  other plants or buildings may contain asbestos due to the age of many of Xcel Energy's  facilities,  but  no  confirmation  or  measurement  of  the  cost  of removal could be determined as of Dec. 31, 2023.

        "page_content": "## Nuclear\n\nNuclear Insurance - NSP-Minnesota's public liability for claims from any nuclear  incident  is  limited  to  $16.2  billion  under  the  Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has $450 million of coverage  for  its  public  liability  exposure  with  a  pool  of  insurance companies.  The  remaining  $15.8  billion  of  exposure  is  funded  by  the Secondary  Financial  Protection  Program  available  from  assessments  by the federal government.\n\nNSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $166 million per reactorincident  for  each  of  its  three  reactors,  for  public  liability  arising  from  a nuclear  incident  at  any  licensed  nuclear  facility  in  the  United  States.  The maximum funding requirement is $25 million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  purchases  insurance  for  property  damage  and  site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are $2.8 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota's two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to $490 million and $420 million at Monticello and Prairie Island, respectively, including the cost of replacement power during prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term.\n\nAll  companies  insured  with  NEIL  are  subject  to  retroactive  premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated  in  the  reserve  funds  of  NEIL  and  EMANI  to  the  extent  that NSP-Minnesota  would  have  no  exposure  for  retroactive  premium assessments in  case  of  a  single  incident  under  the  business  interruption and the property damage insurance coverage.\n\nNSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of $15 million  for  business  interruption  insurance  and  $32  million  for  property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.\n\nNuclear  Fuel  Disposal - NSP-Minnesota is  responsible  for  temporarily storing spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for  permanently  storing  spent  fuel  from  U.S.  nuclear  plants,  but  no  such facility is yet available.\n\nNSP-Minnesota owns temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and dry cask facilities. The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores all 30 of the authorized canisters. Monticello's future spent fuel will continue to be placed  in  its  spent  fuel  pool.  The  decommissioning  plan  addresses  the disposition of spent fuel at the end of the licensed life. In October 2023, a CON  for  additional  storage  at  the  Monticello  site  was  approved  by  the MPUC to support possible life extension to 2040.\n\nThe  PI  dry-cask  storage  facility  currently  stores  50  of  the  64  authorized casks. In February 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a CON with the MPUC for additional storage at PI to support possible life extension to 2054.\n\nRegulatory  Plant  Decommissioning  Recovery -  Decommissioning activities for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are planned to begin at the end of each unit's authorized retirement dates, which can be different than the  currently  approved  NRC  operating  licenses.  These  decommissioning activities are planned to be completed at both facilities by 2101.\n\nNSP-Minnesota's  current  operating  licenses  allow  continued  use  of  its Monticello  nuclear  plant  until  2030  and  its  PI  nuclear  plant  until  2033  for Unit  1  and  2034  for  Unit  2.  The  MPUC  reaffirmed  a  60-year  DECON scenario,  where  Monticello  continues  operations  under  a  10-year  license extension  (approved  in  August  2022).  NRC  approval  of  the  extension  is pending.\n\nIn February 2023, NSP-Minnesota also filed an application with the NDPSC for  an  Advance Determination of Prudence for continued operation of the Monticello Plant until at least 2040. A decision is expected in 2024.\n\nFuture  decommissioning  costs  of  nuclear  facilities  are  estimated  through triennial  periodic  studies  that  assess  the  costs  and  timing  of  planned nuclear  decommissioning  activities  for  each  unit.  The  MPUC  ordered  the next triennial decommissioning study be filed by Dec. 1, 2024.\n\nObligations for decommissioning are expected to be funded 100% by the external decommissioning trust fund. NSP-Minnesota had $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion  of  assets  held  in  external  decommissioning  trusts  at  Dec.  31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nSee  Note  10  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional discussion.\n\n## Leases\n\nXcel Energy evaluates contracts that may contain leases, including PPAs and arrangements for the use of office space and other facilities, vehicles and equipment. A contract contains a lease if it conveys the exclusive right to  control  the  use  of  a  specific  asset.  A  contract  determined  to  contain  a lease  is  evaluated  further  to  determine  if  the  arrangement  is  a  finance lease.\n\nROU  assets  represent  Xcel  Energy's  rights  to  use  leased  assets.  The present  value  of  future  operating  lease  payments  is  recognized  in  other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities. These amounts, adjusted  for  any  prepayments  or  incentives,  are  recognized  as  operating lease ROU assets.\n\nMost  of  Xcel  Energy's  leases  do  not  contain  a  readily  determinable discount  rate.  Therefore,  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments  is generally  calculated  using  the  applicable  Xcel  Energy  subsidiary's estimated  incremental  borrowing  rate  (weighted  average  of  4.4%).  For currently  exiting  asset  classes,  Xcel  Energy  has  elected  the  practical expedient under which non-lease components, such as asset maintenance costs included in payments, are not deducted from lease payments for the purposes of lease accounting and disclosure.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOperating lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| PPAs                             | $  1,832        | $  1,669        |\n| Other                            | 315             | 244             |\n| Gross operating lease ROU assets | 2,147           | 1,913           |\n| Accumulated amortization         | (930)           | (709)           |\n| Net operating lease ROU assets   | $  1,217        | $  1,204        |\n\nROU assets for finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, and the  present  value  of  future  finance  lease  payments  is  included  in  other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\n\nXcel Energy's most significant finance lease activities are related to WYCO, a joint venture with CIG, to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. has a 50% ownership interest in  WYCO.  WYCO  leases  its  facilities  to  CIG,  and  CIG  operates  the facilities, providing natural gas storage and transportation services to PSCo under separate service agreements.",

In  general,  these agreements  provide  for  energy  payments,  based  on  actual  energy delivered,  and  may  also  include  capacity  payments.  Certain  non-lease PPAs with various expiration dates through 2033, contain minimum energy purchase  commitments.  Total  energy  payments  on  those  contracts  were $214  million,  $182  million  and  $149  million  in  2023,  2022  and  2021, respectively.\n\nIncluded  in  electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expenses  for  PPAs accounted  for  as  executory  contracts  were  payments  for  capacity  of  $77 million, $75 million and $69 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nCapacity  and  energy  payments  are  contingent  on  the  IPPs  meeting contract  obligations,  including  plant  availability  requirements.  Certain contractual payments are adjusted based on market indices. The effects of price  adjustments  on  financial  results  are  mitigated  through  purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, the estimated future payments for capacity and energy that  the  utility  subsidiaries  of  Xcel  Energy  are  obligated  to  purchase pursuant  to  these  non-lease  contracts,  subject  to  availability,  were  as follows:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Capacity   | Energy (a)   |\n|-------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| 2024                    | $  80      | $  207       |\n| 2025                    | 45         | 94           |\n| 2026                    | 28         | 47           |\n| 2027                    | 9          | 10           |\n| 2028                    | 1          | 10           |\n| Thereafter              | 2          | 18           |\n| Total                   | $  165     | $  386       |\n\nFuel  Contracts -Xcel  Energy  has  entered  into  various  long-term commitments  for  the  purchase  and  delivery  of  a  significant  portion  of  its coal,  nuclear  fuel  and  natural  gas  requirements.

Xcel  Energy  has  determined  that  certain  IPPs  are  VIEs, however Xcel Energy is not subject to risk of loss from the operations of these  entities,  and  no  significant  financial  support  is  required  other  than contractual payments for energy and capacity.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  solar  PPAs  provide  an  option  to  purchase  emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the  solar  facility  under  contract.  These  specific  PPAs  create  a  variable interest in the IPP.\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluated  each  of  these  VIEs  for  possible  consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and terms of the contract,  control  over  O&M,  control  over  dispatch  of  electricity,  historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices and financing activities. Xcel Energy concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its  consolidated financial statements because Xcel Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance.\n\nThe  utility  subsidiaries  had  approximately  3,751  MW  and  3,961  MW  of capacity  under  long-term  PPAs  at  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022,  respectively, with  entities  that  have  been  determined  to  be  VIEs.  These  agreements have expiration dates through 2041.\n\nFuel  Contracts -  SPS  purchases  all  of  its  coal  requirements  for  its Harrington and Tolk plants from TUCO Inc. under contracts that will expire in  December 2024 and December 2027, respectively. TUCO arranges for the  purchase,  receiving,  transporting,  unloading,  handling,  crushing, weighing  and  delivery  of  coal  to  meet  SPS'  requirements.  TUCO  is responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.\n\nSPS has not provided any significant financial support to TUCO, other than contractual payments for delivered coal. However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS' reimbursement of fuel procurement costs.\n\nSPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE, however it has concluded that SPS is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  TUCO's  economic performance.\n\nLow-Income  Housing  Limited  Partnerships -  Eloigne  and  NSPWisconsin  have  entered  into  limited  partnerships  with  affordable  rental housing activities that qualify for low-income housing tax credits.\n\nEloigne  and  NSP-Wisconsin,  as  primary  beneficiaries  of  these  activities, consolidate  these  limited  partnerships  in  their  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nAmounts reflected in Xcel Energy's consolidated balance sheets for these investments  include  $41  million  of  assets  and  $35  million  of  liabilities  at Dec. 31, 2023, and $44 million of assets and $35 million of liabilities at Dec. 31, 2022.\n\n## Other\n\nTechnology  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  has  several  contracts  for information  technology  services  that  extend  through  2027.

Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net  liability  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries have a stated maximum amount.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries had no assets held as collateral related to their guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements. Guarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding for Xcel Energy were $75 million and $62 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nOther  Indemnification  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries provide indemnifications through various contracts. These are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, as well as breaches of representations and warranties,  including  corporate  existence,  transaction  authorization  and income tax matters with respect to assets sold.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s and its subsidiaries' obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration and amount. Maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\n## 13.

Segment Information\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluates  performance  by  each  utility  subsidiary  based  on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided, including the regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas utility operating  results  of  NSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo.  These segments  are  managed  separately  because  the  revenue  streams  are dependent  upon  regulated  rate  recovery,  which  is  separately  determined for each segment.\n\nXcel Energy has the following reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulated  Electric -  The  regulated  electric  utility segment generates,  purchases,  transmits,  distributes  and  sells  electricity  in Colorado,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. In addition, this segment includes sales for  resale  and  provides  wholesale  transmission  service  to  various entities in the United States. The regulated electric utility segment also includes wholesale commodity and trading operations.\n- \u00b7 Regulated Natural Gas - The regulated natural gas utility segment purchases,  transports,  stores,  distributes  and  sells  natural  gas primarily in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel  Energy  also  presents  All  Other,  which  includes  operating  segments with  revenues  below  the  necessary  quantitative  thresholds.  Those operating  segments  primarily  include  steam  revenue,  appliance  repair services,  non-utility  real  estate  activities,  revenues  associated  with processing  solid  waste  into  RDF,  investments  in  rental  housing  projects that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits  and  equity  method investments in EIP funds.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  equity  method  investments  of  $244  million  and $219 million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022,  respectively,  included  in  the natural gas utility and all other segments.\n\nAsset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy's reportable segments. As an integrated electric and natural gas utility, Xcel Energy  operates  significant  assets  that  are  not  dedicated  to  a  specific business segment.\n\nReporting  assets  and  capital  expenditures  by  business  segment  would require  arbitrary  and  potentially  misleading  allocations,  which  may  not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.\n\nCertain costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest  expense  are  allocated  based  on  cost  causation  allocators  across each segment. In addition, a general allocator is used for certain general and  administrative  expenses,  including  office  supplies,  rent,  property insurance and general advertising.\n\nXcel Energy's segment information:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Regulated Electric                   |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  11,446 | $  12,123 | $  11,205 |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 2         | 2         | 2         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  11,448 | $  12,125 | $  11,207 |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 2,111     | 2,122     | 1,855     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 670       | 636       | 568       |\n| Income tax benefit                   | (135)     | (162)     | (96)      |\n| Net income                           | 1,686     | 1,631     | 1,478     |\n| Regulated Natural Gas                |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  2,645  | $  3,080  | $  2,132  |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 3         | 2         | 2         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  2,648  | $  3,082  | $  2,134  |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 323       | 276       | 254       |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 96        | 86        | 75        |\n| Income tax expense                   | 50        | 68        | 54        |\n| Net income                           | 219       | 264       | 231       |\n| All Other                            |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  115    | $  107    | $  94     |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 14        | 15        | 12        |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 238       | 203       | 173       |\n| Income tax benefit                   | (61)      | (41)      | (28)      |\n| Net loss                             | (134)     | (159)     | (112)     |\n| Consolidated Total                   |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  14,211 | $  15,314 | $  13,435 |\n| Reconciling eliminations             | (5)       | (4)       | (4)       |\n| Total operating revenues             | $  14,206 | $  15,310 | $  13,431 |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 2,448     | 2,413     | 2,121     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 1,004     | 925       | 816       |\n| Income tax benefit                   | (146)     | (135)     | (70)      |\n| Net income                           | 1,771     | 1,736     | 1,597     |\n| 15.   Workforce Reduction            |           |           |           |\n\nIn 2023, Xcel Energy implemented workforce actions to align resources and investments  with  evolving  business  and  customer  needs,  and  streamline the organization for long-term success.\n\n- In  September  2023,  Xcel  Energy  announced  a  voluntary  retirement program to a group of eligible non-bargaining employees, with an enhanced retirement  package  including  certain  health  care  and  cash  benefits  for accepted  employees.  Approximately  400  employees  retired  under  this program in December 2023.\n- In  November  2023,  Xcel  Energy,  Inc.  also  reduced  its  non-bargaining workforce  by  approximately  150  employees  through  an  involuntary severance program.",

In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  is  accumulated  and communicated  to  management,  including  the  CEO  and  CFO,  allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2023,  based  on  an  evaluation  carried  out  under  the supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  Xcel  Energy's  management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and  procedures,  the  CEO  and  CFO  have  concluded  that  Xcel  Energy's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\n## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nNo  changes  in  Xcel  Energy's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting occurred  during  the  most  recent  fiscal  quarter  ended  Dec.  31,  2023  that materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  Xcel Energy's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Xcel  Energy  maintains internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting. Xcel Energy has evaluated and  documented  its  controls  in  process  activities,  general  computer activities, and on an entity-wide level.\n\nDuring the year and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023 on internal controls under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Xcel Energy conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the control evaluation, testing and remediation  performed,  Xcel  Energy  did  not  identify  any  material  control weaknesses, as defined under the standards and rules issued by the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board,  as  approved  by  the  SEC  and  as indicated  in  Xcel  Energy's  Management  Report  on  Internal  Controls  over Financial Reporting, which is contained in Item 8 herein.\n\n## ITEM 9B - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nEffective March 1, 2024, Melissa Ostrom, Vice President, Controller at Xcel Energy  Inc.,  will  begin  serving  as  principal  accounting  officer  of  Xcel Energy.

Executive  Annual  Incentive  Award  Subplan  pursuant  to  the  Xcel Energy  Inc.  Amended  and  Restated  2015  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan.  The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (the 'Committee') of Xcel Energy's Board of Directors administers the Plan and has authority to  determine  when  and  to  whom  awards  will  be  granted,  the  amount  of awards,  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  awards  including  the  applicable performance goals, and will certify the level of goal achievement for award payouts.

The  Plan  also  includes  a  'clawback'  provision  providing  that  awards  are subject to recoupment under Xcel Energy's clawback policies in effect from time  to  time.  A  copy  of  the  Plan  is  filed  as  Exhibit  10.18  hereto  and incorporated herein by reference.\n\nNone  of  the  Company's  directors  or  officers  adopted,  modified,  or terminated  a  Rule  10b5-1  trading  arrangement  or  a  non-Rule  10b5-1 trading  arrangement  during  the  Company's  fiscal  quarter  ended  Dec.  31, 2023.\n\n## ITEM 9C - DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## PART III\n\n## ITEM 10 - DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nInformation  required  under  this  Item  with  respect  to  Directors  and Corporate Governance is set forth in Xcel Energy Inc.'s Proxy Statement for its 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is expected to be filed on  April  9,  2024,  which  is  incorporated  by  reference.

 The  condensed  financial  information  of  Xcel Energy Inc. is presented to comply with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X. Xcel Energy  Inc.'s  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  presented  under  the  equity method  of  accounting.  Under  this  method,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of subsidiaries  are  not  consolidated.  The  investments  in  net  assets  of  the subsidiaries  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheets.  The  income  from operations of the subsidiaries is reported on a net basis as equity in income of subsidiaries.\n\nAs  a  holding  company  with  no  business  operations,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s assets consist primarily of investments in its utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.'s  material  cash  inflows  are  only  from  dividends  and  other  payments received from its utility subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of  debt  and equity securities. The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend  and  other  payments  is  subject  to  the  availability  of  funds  after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of their respective  indebtedness,  the  regulations  of  the  FERC  under  the  Federal Power  Act,  and  applicable  state  laws.  Management  does  not  expect maintaining  these  requirements  to  have  an  impact  on  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future. Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.",

Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  limit  the exposure  to  a  maximum  stated  amount.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2023  and  2022, Xcel  Energy  Inc.  had  no  assets  held  as  collateral  related  to  guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements.\n\nGuarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                                 | Guarantor         |   Guarantee Amount | Current Exposure   | Triggering Event   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Guarantees of Capital  Services purchase contracts  for wind and solar generating  equipment  (a)     | Xcel Energy  Inc. |                951 | (b)                | (c)                |\n| Guarantees of Xcel Energy  Inc.'s utility subsidiaries'  performance on tax credit  sale agreements   | Xcel Energy  Inc. |                100 | (d)                | (c)                |\n| Guarantee performance and  payment of surety bonds for  Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility  subsidiaries  (e) | Xcel Energy  Inc. |                 75 | (f)                | (g)                |\n\n## Indemnification Agreements\n\nXcel Energy Inc. provides indemnifications through contracts entered into in the  normal  course  of  business.  Indemnifications  are  primarily  against adverse  litigation  outcomes  in  connection  with  underwriting  agreements, breaches of representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and certain income tax matters. Obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration or amount. Maximum future  payments  under  these  indemnifications  cannot  be  reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\nRelated  Party  Transactions -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  presents  related  party receivables  net  of  payables.
