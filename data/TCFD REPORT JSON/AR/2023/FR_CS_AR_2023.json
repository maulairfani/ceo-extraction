Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact and may contain the terms 'may', 'will', 'should', 'continue', 'aims', 'estimates', 'projects', 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'plans', 'seeks' or 'anticipates', or words of similar meaning. Such statements are based on Management's current views and assumptions and, by nature, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties; therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them. Actual financial condition, results of operations, performance or events may di/ff er materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors including, without limitation, general economic and political conditions and competitive situations; future financial market performance and conditions, including fluctuations in exchange and interest rates; frequency and severity of insured loss events, and increases in loss expenses; mortality and morbidity levels and trends; persistency levels; changes in laws, regulations and standards; the impact of acquisitions and disposals, including related integration issues, and reorganization measures; and general competitive factors, in each case on a local, regional, national and/or global basis. Many of these factors may be more likely to occur, or more pronounced, as a result of catastrophic\n\nI\n\nI\n\nevents, including weather-related catastrophic events, pandemics, terrorist-related incidents or acts of war. Please refer to Section 5 'Risk Factors and Risk Management' of this Annual Report for a description of certain important factors, risks and uncertainties that may a/ff ect AXA's business and/or results of operations.

These non-GAAP financial measures generally have no standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similarly labelled measures used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Group are defined in the Glossary set forth in Appendix IV to this Annual Report.",

Over the past few years, the Group has undergone a significant refocusing on technical risks, built its global leadership in large corporate risks through the acquisition of XL, and strengthened its positions in high-potential markets. This new, refocused, and simplified AXA is now perfectly positioned to engage in the next phase of accelerating its development by combining technical excellence with proximity to its clients.\n\nThis transformation has enabled us to achieve an excellent financial performance throughout the plan. The Group has achieved, or exceeded, its key objectives, with specifically an annual growth in earnings per share of 9% and a return on equity of nearly 15%. This performance is confirmed in the strength of our latest annual results with a 3% increase in activity to \u20ac103 billion and a 6% increase in operating profit to \u20ac7.6 billion despite a challenging environment.\n\nWith a Solvency II ratio of 227% as of December 31, 2023, the Group has once again demonstrated the strength of its balance sheet. This allows us to continue an attractive capital management policy for our shareholders, accelerated this year with the announcement of a new share buyback plan of \u20ac1.6 billion.\n\nBuilding on these good results, we unveiled our new ' Unlock the Future ' plan in early 2024, which sets AXA's strategic priorities for 2026. This will enable us to realize the full potential of our market positioning, with ambitions for organic growth in our key businesses, both for our corporate and individual clients. We will achieve this by further strengthening our technical excellence and through an ambitious digital transformation strategy.\n\nThis plan will also confirm our longstanding commitments to sustainable development and corporate responsibility. In the face of the growing risks of climate change, we remain convinced of the crucial role of our industry in helping our clients protect themselves, but also in supporting them in their own adaptation with a dedicated entity, AXA Climate. We will also continue to pay particular attention to the most vulnerable populations. In this spirit, our goal is to significantly develop our inclusive insurance o/ff erings to enable everyone to have access to insurance coverage. Wherever we are present, we will continue to act with conviction and responsibility to give everyone the means to protect themselves.\n\nFinally, we would like to acknowledge the exceptional work of our 147,000 employees, agents, and partners who once again this year demonstrated remarkable commitment to serving our clients. Their passion and dedication are our greatest strength and an immense source of pride for us.\n\nAntoine Gosset-Grainville\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThomas Buberl\n\nChief Executive O/ff icer\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Strategic orientations\n\nIn 2023, the market context was characterized by a persistently high level of uncertainty. The emergence of a new crisis in the Middle East, along with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, led to increased geopolitical tensions, resulting in volatility in energy prices and new disruptions to supply chains. The financial sector, particularly the banking sector in the US and in Switzerland, faced unexpected turmoil (Credit Suisse, US regional banks). Additionally, natural catastrophes occurred with great frequency and severity on a global scale. Nevertheless, inflation stabilised in most economies, and interest rates began to decrease during this period. In this context, the insurance industry demonstrated resilience but is still facing a range of both threats and opportunities:\n\n- \u25a0 macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain volatile: (i) ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as tensions between  the US and China posing a threat to global stability, (ii) major general elections in the US, in the European Union and other large economies (Indonesia, South Korea) which may accelerate global fragmentation, (iii) uncertain growth outlook in certain large economies (Europe and China), (iv) persistent inflation and tightened monetary and credit conditions which may trigger risk of recession, and (v) impacts from climate change;\n- \u25a0 continuing pressure on the insurance industry: (i) lower purchasing power for individual clients and deteriorating growth prospects impacting corporate clients, (ii) rising claims frequency and cost, particularly medical inflation as well as transfer of spending from public to private (health sector) challenging profitability, even a/f\\_t er raising prices, (iii) increased frequency and severity of global risks (natural events, cyber), and (iv) increasing complexity and cost associated with regulation;\n- \u25a0 growth opportunities : (i) new insurance needs from customers (natural event coverage, cyber); (ii) higher interest rates and equity markets stability supporting competitiveness of Life & Saving o/ff er versus banking products to attract investment cash flows, (iii) rising demand for Health and Protection insurance, accelerated by ageing population in mature countries and public sector disengagement, and (iv) technology & data, particularly Generative AI, driving di/ff erentiation across the business, from pricing, claims management, to customer service and optimizing operations.\n\nAXA faces this challenging context from a position of strength, having successfully delivered on its plan ' Driving Progress 2023 ' across its strategic priorities :\n\n- \u25a0 expand Health and Protection : (i) solid growth in Health revenues with an increase (1) of 5% over the plan, (ii) scale-up of our Health operations in Europe with the acquisition of Laya, leader of the Irish Health market with ca. 28% market share, ca. \u20ac800 million of premiums and close to 700,000 customers, and (iii) development of more inclusive o/ff ers and products, particularly in Protection, for our customers;\n- \u25a0 simplify customer experience and accelerate efficiency : (i) excellence in customer experience, surpassing NPS (2) targets across all lines of business, (ii) strong productivity gain achieved despite significant inflationary headwinds with Group Noncommission expenses ratio decreasing by -0.7 pts over the plan, (iii) significant step forward on digitalisation of customer journeys with an increase of +30 pts from 2020 to 2023, and (iv) deployment of AXA Secure GPT to enable enterprise-wide use of the Generative AI technologies;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 strengthen underwriting performance : (i) Property & Casualty combined ratio of 93.2% in 2023 down -4.4 pts from 2022, seizing favourable pricing environment and improving technical excellence, (ii) successful technical strengthening of AXA XL with 90.4% Property & Casualty combined ratio achieved in 2023, and (iii) deployment of the Digital Commercial Platform, a data-driven and customer-centric platform that enables the Group to o/ff er innovative solutions to its clients;\n- \u25a0 s ustain our leading climate position : (i) rea/ff irmation of AXA's leading climate position and commitment to align its business with the COP21 Paris Agreement , (ii) announcement of new targets for 2030 to drive the decarbonization for both its insurance and investments portfolios, and (iii) continue to support the climate transition, namely with the development of climate training ( e.g . AXA Climate Academy), green investments of \u20ac29.9 billion as of end of 2023 and the signing in 2023 of a ten-year Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) with IGNIS (3) ;\n- \u25a0 optimization of cash efficiency across the Group : (i) achievement of a cash remittance of \u20ac6.5 billion in 2023, (ii) further in-force management initiatives with \u20ac10 billion general account reserve reduction in France through a reinsurance agreement for an in-force Savings portfolio at AXA France, and (iii) successful execution of \u20ac1.1 billion share buy-back program in 2023 reflecting the strength of AXA balance sheet and demonstrating its financial discipline.\n- \u2026 while meeting or exceeding its main financial objectives :\n- \u25a0 underlying Earnings per share (4) average yearly growth at 9% over 2020-2023 ( vs . 3-7% target range);\n- \u25a0 return on equity at 14.9% in 2023 ( vs . 13-15% target range);\n- \u25a0 cumulated cash remittance of \u20ac16.4 billion ( vs . \u20ac14 billion target);\n- \u25a0 Solvency II ratio (5) at 227% at year-end 2023 ( vs . 190% target level).\n\nFollowing the successful completion of its ' Driving Progress 2023 ' plan, the new strategic plan ' Unlock the Future ' will aim at strengthening and growing the Group's core businesses:\n\n- \u25a0 driving profitable organic growth through selective expansion in our core businesses and growing distribution;\n- \u25a0 scaling technical excellence by using data analytics to improve pricing, claims, and risk selection, and expanding prevention services;\n- \u25a0 delivering operational excellence through automation, o/ff  shoring, and use of data and AI.\n\nOver the period 2024-2026, AXA will seek to deliver profitable organic growth and scale technical excellence across each of its businesses, Property & Casualty Commercial lines, Employee Benefits and individual Health, and Retail Property & Casualty and Life & Savings , while driving operational excellence across its entire organization.\n\nIn P&C Commercial lines , AXA will aim to deliver above nominal GDP (6) revenue growth driven by structural portfolio growth reflecting continued demand from corporates, and leveraging its global scale, product capabilities, and diversified distribution. The Group will seek to expand in Property & Casualty mid-market, including in white spaces in Europe where the Group can grow its market share, and through selective initiatives in the US, and",

The Group will focus on disciplined cycle management at AXA XL and leverage use of data analytics to strengthen SME and midmarket pricing and risk selection capabilities in order to sustain its technical excellence. The Group will also leverage proprietary risk consulting services to drive higher customer loyalty and margin, by integrating its Digital Commercial Platform across entities.\n\nIn Employee Benefits and Individual Health , the Group has built a global franchise combining strong local market positions and international businesses, with distinct, proven, and scalable capabilities, including global dataset, distribution, and comprehensive product o/ff erings. The Group will target above nominal GDP revenue growth, focusing on growing its most profitable segments around its Employee Benefits o/ff ering for SME, International Private Medical Insurance, and individual customers. The Group will also continue to drive technical excellence by scaling its proprietary assets across pricing and claims management while accelerating its innovative service proposition.\n\nIn Retail Property & Casualty and Life & Savings , AXA is wellpositioned to capture value, building on customer proximity, deep local expertise, and Group technology capabilities. The Group will target revenue growth in line with nominal GDP across its mature markets, with faster growth in Property & Casualty Non-Motor and Retirement. Growth is expected to be driven by expanding distribution capabilities, including by increasing our agent network size selectively and improving agent productivity, and by increasing wallet share within our existing customer base, capitalizing on high customer satisfaction. In Property & Casualty , the Group expects profitability to improve, benefiting from pricing actions. The Group will leverage its dynamic pricing models, procurement initiatives, and computable contracts to further strengthen technical margin. In Life & Savings , AXA will focus on enhancing its high-quality mix, through innovative capital-light savings products (7) in Europe, supported by AXA IM expertise.\n\nAXA will maintain its focus on operational excellence , by scaling existing capabilities across automation, shoring, and data and AI, building on productivity gains achieved through ' Driving Progress 2023 '. The Group intends to take a systematic approach to automation with end-to-end straight-through processing and scale its well-established shoring capabilities; p roven high-value\n\nI\n\nI\n\ndata & AI use cases will also be scaled, with additional business upli/f\\_t  through Generative AI.\n\n## In addition, the new strategic plan includes the following main financial targets :\n\n- \u25a0 underlying earnings per share compounded annual growth rate over 2023 to 2026 estimated between 6% and 8%;\n- \u25a0 underlying return on equity between 14% and 16% over 2024 estimated to 2026 estimated; and\n- \u25a0 over \u20ac21 billion cumulative organic cash upstream over 2024 estimated to 2026 estimated.\n\nUnderlying earnings growth is expected to be driven by strong operating performance across our lines of business as well as a recovery in UK Health and margin improvement in Property and Casualty Retail. Earnings growth is expected to be achieved even a/f\\_t er taking into account headwinds from (i) the unwind of the discount (8) in Property and Casualty, (ii) lower interest rates compared to 2023 average levels, (iii) claims inflation only expected to normalize by 2025, (iv) moderation of Property and Casualty Commercial line pricing (v) a higher Nat Cat load (9) , and (vi) the introduction of the OECD tax reform.\n\nThe Group has increased its underlying return on equity target, reflecting the high quality of its businesses, which is expected to drive book value growth.\n\nThe Group has significantly increased its ambition of cumulative cash upstream from \u20ac14 billion between 2021 and 2023 to above \u20ac21 billion over 2024 to 2026. The Group aims to achieve an organic cash remittance ratio (10) of approximately 80% over 2024 to 2026, with all businesses expected to deliver excellent remittance levels.\n\nThe Group also expects to continue to operate with its Solvency II ratio (11) at a high level, benefiting from 25 to 30 points of normalized Solvency II operating capital generation per annum , and limited sensitivity to interest rates and very adverse shocks (12) .\n\nThe Group intends to maintain a stable debt stock, with flexibility within its Debt Gearing target of 19 to 23 points.\n\nFinally, as part of the new strategic plan, AXA formalized a new capital management policy in its press release entitled 'AXA announces its 2024-2026 strategy, setting ambitious new financial targets', available on axa.com.",

Proposals for dividend payments are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are submitted for approval at the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAXA's dividend policy is based on underlying earnings per share. AXA targets, in line with its ' Unlock the Future ' strategic plan announced on February 22, 2024, to (i) pay aggregate dividends of 60% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per share, and (ii) adhere to a dividend per share floor whereby the proposed dividend per share in any given year is targeted to be at least equal to the dividend per share paid in the prior year (subject to the absence of a significant capital event, i.e . an event which significantly deteriorates the Group's solvency ). The Board of Directors has full discretion to determine\n\nthe dividend to be proposed at the applicable Shareholders' Meeting, taking into account a variety of factors, including AXA's earnings, financial condition, applicable capital and solvency requirements, prevailing operating and financial market conditions and the general economic environment.\n\nA dividend of \u20ac1.98 per share for the 2023 fiscal year will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April 23, 2024.\n\nThe Company's dividend policy is part of a wider capital management policy which targets an aggregate payout ratio (based on dividend payouts and share buy-backs) of 75% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per share.\n\nThe following table sets forth information on the dividends declared and paid in respect of the last five fiscal years:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Distribution  (in Euro million)   | Number of shares  (on December 31)   | Net dividend  per share  (in Euro)   | Dividend per share  eligible for a tax relief  (in Euro)   | Gross dividend  per share  (in Euro)   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|          2019 | 1,765                             | 2,417,695,123                        | 0.73  (b)                            | 0.73  (b)                                                  | 0.73  (b)                              |\n|          2020 | 3,458                             | 2,418,389,408                        | 1.43  (c)                            | 1.43  (c)                                                  | 1.43  (c)                              |\n|          2021 | 3,729                             | 2,421,568,696                        | 1.54  (d)                            | 1.54  (d)                                                  | 1.54  (d)                              |\n|          2022 | 3,998                             | 2,351,770,945                        | 1.70  (e)                            | 1.70  (e)                                                  | 1.70  (e)                              |\n|          2023 | 4,495  (a)                        | 2,270,188,806                        | 1.98  (f)                            | 1.98  (f)                                                  | 1.98  (f)                              |\n\nDividends not claimed within five years a/f\\_t er the payout date become the property of the French Public Treasury.\n\nFor further information on AXA's dividend, see Section 2.4 'Liquidity and capital resources - Impact of regulatory requirements Group Capital Management Objectives', Note 26.5 'Other items: Restriction on dividend payments to shareholders' in Section 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and Section 7.3 'General Information - Bylaws - Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to the shares' of this Annual Report.

A VPPA makes it possible both to contribute to the equivalent of all or part of a consumer's energy needs and to supply the grid with renewable electricity.\n\nThe contract signed by AXA concerns a solar power plant in Spain, with the objective of being operational by May 2025.\n\nUnder the agreement, AXA undertook to purchase 90% of the renewable electricity produced by this future power plant, i.e . 84 GWh per year. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of the buildings and data centers of the Group's European entities.\n\nSchneider Electric, the leading advisor on global corporate renewable energy procurement, supported AXA in the selection of their projects and negotiations in the VPPA.\n\n## AXA launched ' We Care ' program for all employees worldwide\n\nOn October 3, 2023, AXA went one step further in its global health and well-being o/ff ering for its employees by announcing the launch of its ' We Care ' program, designed to provide support to AXA's workforce at di/ff erent life stages and during moments that matter. The program aims to provide AXA's 147,000 employees, agents and partners  with the time, support, and resources to make personal and professional decisions with confidence.\n\nThe new program reflects an important evolution in the existing o/ff ering and enables AXA to progress further on its long-term commitment towards an inclusive and supportive global workplace culture.\n\nThe ' We Care ' program will be one of AXA's key milestones for its next strategic plan 2024-2026 and o/ff ered to all AXA's employees across 51 countries. It will be deployed across all AXA entities by the end of 2024 (1) through four main pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 caregiver policy: a new policy has been introduced to provide employees caring for immediate family members who require eldercare or care due to a serious health condition and/or disability with up to five days of fully paid leave;\n- \u25a0 domestic and sexual violence policy: AXA stands against domestic, intra-familial and sexual violence. For any employee impacted by such a situation, AXA is committed to providing access to psychological support, specialist support services, flexible working arrangements and five days of fully paid leave;\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.1 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- \u25a0 parental policy: alongside the existing 16 weeks fully paid parent leave for the primary parent, the ' We Care ' program will also see the length of fully paid co-parent leave double, from 4 weeks to 8 weeks.

Carried out among 3,500 experts in 50 countries and a representative sample of 20,000 members of the general population in 15 countries, this study measures and ranks their perception of evolving and rising risks. Since 2020, this report has been produced in partnership with the IPSOS polling institute. The data is then analyzed by the AXA Group's in-house experts.\n\nThis year, the study highlighted the concept of polycrisis. Geopolitical tensions, the exponential emergence of new technologies (such as generative AI), or the acceleration of global warming, no longer follow one another but are happening at the same time.\n\nThe main findings of the 2023 edition of the Future Risks Report were as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the risks associated with artificial intelligence and big data showed the greatest increase in the experts' rankings, rising from fourteenth place in 2022 to fourth place in 2023. Most of the experts (64%) and the public (70%) even believe that AI research should be halted;\n- \u25a0 for the sixth year running, cybersecurity risks are on the experts' podium. For the first time, they have also made it into the Top 3 for the general population. The 'cyber-war' motif was included in the list enabling the experts to justify their choice, closely linking this subject to that of geopolitical instability, in third position this year;\n- \u25a0 as was the case last year, global warming was in first place among both experts and the public. But, for the first time, this risk is ranked first in every region of the world, including by the public, without exception;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

However, China's Shanghai CSI 300 index posted a drop of 11% as concerns about the economy and government intervention continued to weigh.\n\nI\n\nI",

Although in the first half of the year, 10-year US Treasury yields were broadly steady between 3.50-3.75%, with yields falling sharply around the time of the bank failures in March, they peaked at 5% in October and then dropped sharply below 4% towards year-end to close the year at 3.88% - flat compared to their 2022 close.\n\nIn Europe, bond volatility was higher in the first few months of the year as markets focused on the ECB outlook. A/f\\_t er certain US bank failures and the Credit Suisse rescue, European yields fell back sharply. Hence, they gradually rose from this point with the 10-year German bund yield reaching a peak in October close to 3.00%, before falling back in line with global yields and closing the year 55 bps lower than end-2022. Yields closed even lower in France (-56 bps), Italy (-102 bps) and Spain (-67 bps). The UK 10-year Gilt yield followed a similar pattern to close the year at 3.54% (down 14 bps from end-2022).\n\nHowever, in Japan, the central bank stated at the back end of 2022 that it would allow a 10-year bond yields to fluctuate by +/-50 bps\n\nof its target of zero, instead of the previous band of +/-25 bps. As a result, yields were sharply impacted by this change on yield control policy.  This paved the way for yields to rise in 2023 and peak close to 1% at the start of November before yields followed the international pattern and reversed sharply to year-end closing the year at 0.61%, which was still 19 bps higher than 2022.\n\nCredit markets had already recovered from a material repricing by the end of 2022. Spreads were broadly stable throughout the year and tightened towards year-end, except for the period around the turmoil in the banking sector in the United States and Switzerland in March which saw credit spreads widen. In the United States, investment grade corporate debt closed the year with spreads at 104 bps - its lowest since January 2022 and down 25 bps versus 2022. In addition, the high yield in the United States was also down 30 bps to close at 334 bps. The picture was similar in Europe, investment grade debt decreased by 19 bps on the year, with a spread at 135 bps, high yield debt closed at 395 bps, down 20 bps on the year.\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES\n\n|                        | End of Period Exchange rate   | End of Period Exchange rate   | Average Exchange rate   | Average Exchange rate   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| (for  \u20ac1)              | December 31, 2023             | December 31, 2022             | December 31, 2023       | December 31, 2022       |\n| US Dollar              | 1.10                          | 1.07                          | 1.08                    | 1.05                    |\n| British Pound Sterling | 0.87                          | 0.89                          | 0.87                    | 0.85                    |\n| Swiss Franc            | 0.93                          | 0.99                          | 0.97                    | 1.00                    |\n| Japanese Yen           | 156                           | 141                           | 152                     | 138                     |\n\nSource: WM/Refinitiv\n\nI\n\nI",

Other currencies were more mixed,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Market Conditions\n\n## INSURANCE ACTIVITIES\n\n## Main developed markets\n\nIn France , the Savings insurance market was up 5% compared to last year, reaching \u20ac153.3 billion of premiums and benefiting from a positive upward trend on both Unit-Linked (+8%) and General Account (+4%) products. The Unit-Linked share remained stable compared to last year at 41%. The level of surrenders increased throughout the year in favor of alternatives investments such as ' Livret A ', which fueled the fierce competition on the guaranteed participation rates, that have materially increased. The Protection and complementary Health insurance market in France witnessed very high medical inflation that the market partly absorbed through an average tari/ff  increase of 6% in 2023. The rising cost and frequency of claims have both accentuated and are now higher compared to pre-COVID levels. In addition, the ' 100% Sant\u00e9 ' policy combined with the reduction in the reimbursements by the Social Security led to the cost transfer from the public to the private sector. The Property & Casualty market this year was less impacted by the high frequency of climatic events than in 2022, despite the Ciaran and Domingos storms as well as drought and floods in northern France which represented a total cost for insurers of around \u20ac3 billion ( vs . \u20ac10.3 billion in 2022). Nevertheless, this year continued to give momentum to the upward trend in the cost of climatic events witnessed since 1990.\n\n- In Europe (excluding France), a/f\\_t er a benign natural events experience in the first half of the year, Property and Casualty insurance markets have been hit by multiple severe weather events mainly from hailstorms and floods notably in Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and Ireland as well as in Switzerland. In the Motor insurance business, rising repairing costs and higher frequency from changing post-pandemic driving habits have resulted in more detrimental impacts than initially anticipated notably in Individual business. Globally, European Property and Casualty Insurance markets continued to be impacted by a persistently high inflationary context, leading insurers to keep implementing mitigation actions on both pricing and claims management. In Life and Savings, European markets su/ff ered from unfavorable\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.2 MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\nas British Pound Sterling rose against Euro by 2% to close the year at GBP 0.87. The Bank of Japan continued to resist tighter monetary policy and the growing interest rate di/ff erential weighed on the Japanese Yen against Euro which gained 11% over the year, closing at JPY 156.\n\nmacroeconomic environment: inflation-driven disposable income pressure and higher competition from banking products, resulting from rising interest rates, negatively impacted net cash flows notably in Italy. In Health, European private insurers are facing several long-term challenges such as Europe's ageing population, claims cost inflation and increasing strains on national healthcare systems leading to progressive price increases implementation notably in Germany and in the United Kingdom.\n\n- In Japan , the Life insurance market sustained its recovery from the COVID-19 related disruption and improved by 13% in terms of GWP, mainly driven by strong sales in traditional GA Savings foreign currency denominated products in the context of interest rate hikes. Although the COVID-19 claims decreased, the net income of major insurers were impacted by increased hedging costs and additional reserves for policies a/ff ected by foreign exchanges rates' fluctuations. The Property & Casualty insurance market slightly decreased by 0.3% in terms of GWP, as the growth of Marine and Personal accidents was o/ff set by the decrease in Casualty and a decline in Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance impacted by the tari/ff  reduction implemented in April 2023, while Motor maintained stable growth.\n- In Hong Kong , the Life gross written premiums decreased by 1.7% compared to last year largely caused by isolated transactions related to retirement scheme business. New business recorded significant growth derived from the recovery of mainland Chinese visitors. The Property & Casualty insurance market grew 4.5% benefiting from recovery in travel business.\n\nThe United States Property rates increased throughout 2023, reflecting significant natural catastrophe loss activity with increased secondary perils losses, rising property values, tighter reinsurance terms and conditions, and higher ceded rates.\n\nOverall, the United States Casualty insurance market witnessed moderate market conditions, with flat pricing, disciplined underwriting, and healthy appetite despite insurer concerns about economic, social, and claims inflation. The adverse implications from social inflation, including jury awards and litigation costs, continue to rise, a/ff ecting loss costs in the casualty lines,  underwriting and reserve margins.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

Property reinsurance costs have risen while coverage capacity has declined owing to storm and wildfire losses a/ff ecting the Unites States in recent years. The year 2023 was once again characterized by very high insured losses from multiple natural disasters though there was no extremely severe single named event. Adequacy of premium levels to deal with increasing average costs and emerging secondary perils have also led to reduced risk appetite from providers of capital at lower layers. Casualty treaty reinsurers asserting concerns about social inflation and rate adequacy led to higher reinsurance costs and tighter terms and conditions.\n\n## Main emerging markets\n\nIn Asia Emerging Markets , the Property & Casualty insurance market benefited from a strong growth across most geographies. The market grew notably thanks to Motor business in China, Thailand and the Philippines, higher sales from Agriculture in China, as well as Property coverages in the Philippines. The Life insurance market continues showing good trends.

Property & Casualty grew mainly thanks to the Motor business, from steady price increases to o/ff set the full recovery of frequency, a continued high level of inflation, as well as the recovery of the new-vehicle sales which are already at pre-pandemic levels. Life growth was positively driven by the sales of Unit-Linked products. As for Health, in 2023 the market grew by 12.6% mainly driven by price e/ff ect and a slight increase in Group business volume. In T\u00fcrkiye, Property & Casualty market grew by 113% mainly driven by a strong 65% inflation. Excluding this impact, actual growth was mainly linked to an increase in penetration reflecting higher awareness following the Earthquake of February 2023, as well as higher volumes on the Motor business. The Colombian insurance market grew by 13.5% notably thanks to Workers Compensation, Motor, and Property lines, partly o/ff  setting the decrease in SOAT (Protection) following a change in the regulated tari/ff s.",

Fears of higher inflation and weaker growth have been the biggest themes this year as central banks continued to raise rates in the first half of the year. The credit asset class was also impacted by the crisis in US regional banks, with the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank and the Credit Suisse debacle which sparked its fears of contagion in the banking sector.\n\nWithin alternative assets, Private debt has emerged as one of the standout alternative assets strategies in 2023, delivering consistent returns for investors and winning market share from banks and syndicated loan markets. On the contrary, Real assets fundraising were impacted by higher financing costs, which forced investors\n\nI\n\nI\n\nto recalibrate risk appetite and return expectations. Soaring financing costs have not only directly and negatively impacted asset valuations, but also significantly slowed transaction activity in most markets.\n\nDespite volatility in the capital markets, there was a recovery in net inflows thanks to better fixed income yields, notably towards intermediate and long maturity funds. In high-yield the picture was less rosy with ongoing outflows throughout the year, although this trend changed slightly in Q4 thanks to a resumption of so/f\\_t -landing rhetoric. Equity markets delivered strong performance as corporate earnings remained resilient.\n\nBesides the impact from financial markets, assets under management continued to showcase the structural trends as observed in past years with continued pressure on margins.",

A reconciliation from Underlying Earnings and Combined Ratio to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal, or total in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the corresponding period is provided in the above tables. Underlying Return on Equity and Underlying Earnings per Share are reconciled to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the table set forth on page 59 of this Annual Report, and the calculation methodology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nof the Debt Gearing is set out on page 560 of this Annual Report. For further information on any of the above-mentioned APMs, please see the definitions and the Glossary on Appendix IV of this Annual Report.\n\nIFRS 17 and IFRS 9 became effective on, and have been implemented by the Group since, January 1, 2023. The new accounting standards have impacted certain components of the APMs published by AXA. For definitions of relevant accounting components under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, please refer to Note 1 of the AXA's 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements').\n\n## Commentary on Group Earnings\n\nSince January 1, 2023, the Group has implemented the IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments accounting standards.\n\nRestated 2022 comparative information has been prepared under the new standards. All tables in this section of this Annual Report present the prior-year comparative financial figures as restated in accordance with IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Underlying Earnings restated under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 amounted to \u20ac6,080 million, down \u20ac1,184 million (-16%) versus the published full-year 2022 Underlying Earnings under IFRS 4 and IAS 39, mainly driven by Property & Casualty down \u20ac1,499 million, notably from lower prior year's reserve developments partly o/ff set by higher discounting impact of claims reserves, while Life & Health Underlying Earnings were higher by \u20ac317 million, mainly reflecting an acceleration in the pattern of earnings recognition induced by the CSM Release mechanism under IFRS 17. Underlying Earnings for Asset Management, Banking and Holdings remained at the same level as previously reported under IFRS 4 and IAS 39 for full-year 2022.\n\nThe sum of items reconciling Underlying Earnings to Net Income under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 amounted to \u20ac-1,019 million, down \u20ac430 million versus the sum of items reconciling Underlying Earnings to Net Income for full-year 2022 published under IFRS 4 and IAS 39, mainly from lower realized capital gains from equity\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsecurities that are accounted for as other comprehensive income without recycling under IFRS 9. As a result, Net Income under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 amounted to \u20ac5,061 million, down \u20ac1,614 million (-24%) versus full-year 2022 under IFRS 4 and IAS 39.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nOn a reported basis, Underlying Earnings amounted to \u20ac7,604 million under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, up \u20ac341 million (+5%) versus full-year 2022 Underlying Earnings under IFRS 4 and IAS 39, and up \u20ac1,524 million (+25%) versus full-year 2022 Underlying Earnings as restated under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.\n\nOn a constant exchange rate basis, Underlying Earnings increased by \u20ac453 million (+6%) under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 versus full-year 2022 Underlying Earnings under IFRS 4 and IAS 39, stemming from Property and Casualty (\u20ac+637 million or +14%) and Life & Health (\u20ac+40 million or +1%), partly o/ff set by Asset Management (\u20ac-37 million) and Holdings (\u20ac-187 million). On a constant exchange rate basis, Underlying Earnings under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 increased by \u20ac1,637 million (+27%).\n\nUnderlying Earnings per Share were at \u20ac3.31 on a fully diluted basis, up 8% versus full year 2022 under IFRS 4 and IAS 39, and up 29% under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.",

and\n- \u25a0 higher integration and restructuring costs, up \u20ac21 million (+7%) to \u20ac-303 million, mainly due to higher restructuring costs in Europe (\u20ac-184 million) from workforce e/ff iciency measures, as well as AXA XL (\u20ac-63 million) from IT productivity initiatives, including automation.",

The report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements covers only the information included in Note 4.\n\nLiquidity management is a core part of the Group's financial planning and includes the management of our debt and the maturities of our debt instruments and, more generally, the Group's capital allocation strategy. Liquidity resources result mainly from Insurance and Asset Management operations, as well as from capital-raising activities and committed bank credit lines.\n\nOver the past several years, the Group has expanded its core operations (Insurance, Reinsurance, and Asset Management) through a combination of organic growth, direct investments, and acquisitions. This expansion has been funded primarily through a combination of (i) dividends received from operating subsidiaries, (ii) proceeds from the issuance of debt instruments (mainly subordinated debts) and internal borrowings, (iii) the issuance of ordinary shares, and (iv) proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses and assets.\n\nEach of the major operating subsidiaries of the Group is responsible for managing its own liquidity position, in coordination with the Company. The Company, as the holding company of the AXA Group, coordinates funding and liquidity management and, in this role, participates in financing the operations of certain of its subsidiaries. Certain of AXA's subsidiaries, including XL Group Limited, AXA Konzern AG, AXA UK Plc. and AXA Mediterranean Holding SA, are also holding companies and consequently, depend on dividends received from their own subsidiaries to meet their obligations. The Group's operating (re)insurance companies are required to meet multiple regulatory constraints and, in particular, minimum solvency ratios. The policy of upstreaming dividends from subsidiaries to the holding Company AXA SA takes into account these prudential constraints. Cash positions also fluctuate as a result of cash-settled margin calls from counterparties related to collateral agreements on derivatives. While the use of derivatives has been decreasing at the Company level, the Company's statutory results may be significantly impacted by unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge, in particular, currency and interest rate risks. In addition, since it became a regulated reinsurer in 2022, the Company operates reinsurance activities whose liquidity resources and needs are monitored separately.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash dividends received from its operating subsidiaries, a/f\\_t er taking into account organic reinvestments in subsidiaries and existing operations, will continue to cover its operating expenses as a holding (including interest payments on its outstanding debts and borrowings) as well as shareholder distributions objectives (through dividend and annual share repurchases), in line with the Group's Capital Management Policy, until the end of the new strategic plan announced on February 22, 2024. In line with its commitment to financial discipline, future inorganic investments of the Company would be funded from available cash remaining a/f\\_t er payments of operating expenses, dividends and execution of annual share repurchase programs pursuant to the Group's Capital Management Policy. Other financing sources available to the Company include proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and businesses as well as future issuances of debt and/or equity instruments. For additional information, on the Group's capital management policy, please refer to the paragraph 'Group Capital Management objectives' of this section.\n\nRegulatory or governmental authorities may recommend or request holding companies of insurance groups or regulated reinsurers such as AXA to limit their dividend payments and many subsidiaries, particularly insurance entities, are subject to local regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. Since the completion of the Company's transformation into the Group Internal Reinsurer on June 30, 2022, the ACPR, while remaining the supervising authority for the Group, also has supervisory power over AXA as an ACPR-licensed reinsurance company. For more information on these restrictions, see Note 26.5 'Other items: restrictions on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and paragraphs 'The Group's or its insurance or reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition', 'We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and shareholder distributions, including dividend payments' and 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions and emerging legal, regulatory and reputational risks in/uni202Fthe/uni202Fvarious jurisdictions in which we/uni202Foperate' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' (1) of this Annual Report.",

These funds are mainly used to pay policyholder benefits, claims and related expenses, policy surrenders and other operating expenses, as well as to purchase financial assets and meet potential collateral exchange obligations in relation to derivatives. The liquidity of the Group's insurance operations is a/ff  ected by, among other things, the overall quality of the Group's investments and the Group's ability to liquidate its financial assets in a timely manner and to meet policyholder benefits and insurance claims as they fall due. The Group regularly reviews the quality of its assets to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios.\n\nInformation on projected payments and surrenders related to Life and Property & Casualty insurance contracts are disclosed in Note 12.1.9 'Liquidity risk arising from contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 ' in Section 6 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report.\n\nInformation in this section should be read in conjunction with, in particular, sub-sections 'Market-related risks', 'Insurance and reinsurance pricing and underwriting-related risks' and 'Operational risks' in Section 5.1 Risk Factors (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## PROPERTY & CASUALTY (INCLUDING REINSURANCE)\n\nLiquidity needs of Property & Casualty activities can be a/ff ected by actual claims experience. Property & Casualty Insurance's net cash flows are generally positive. They can be negative in the case of exceptional loss events, such as natural or man-made catastrophe events or poor profitability of run-o/ff  of all or part of portfolio. A portion of these cash flows is invested in liquid, short-term bonds, and other listed securities in order to manage the liquidity risk that may arise from such events.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## LIFE & HEALTH\n\nLiquidity needs of Life & Health activities can be a/ff ected by a number of factors including fluctuations in the level of surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and guarantees to policyholders.\n\nThe investment strategy of AXA's Life & Health subsidiaries is designed to match the investment returns and estimated maturities of their investments with expected cash flows on their insurance contracts. Entities regularly monitor the valuation and duration of their investments and the performance of their financial assets. Financial market performance may a/ff ect the level of surrenders and withdrawals on Life insurance policies, as well as immediate and projected long-term cash needs. Group operating entities seek to adjust their investment portfolios to reflect such considerations and react in a targeted manner.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for AXA's Asset Management subsidiaries are operating cash flows, repurchase agreements, borrowings from credit institutions, drawings on credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares (where applicable).\n\nThe financing needs of Asset Management subsidiaries arise principally from their activities, which require working capital, in particular to constitute seed money for new funds at AXA Investment Managers.\n\n2",

At year-end 2023, the Group had:\n\n- \u25a0 a significant cash position across all business lines (information on cash flows from operations is provided in Note 10 'Cash and cash equivalents' in Part 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report). As of December 31, 2023, AXA's consolidated statement of financial position included cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac25.0 billion, net of bank overdra/f\\_t s of \u20ac0.8 billion;\n- \u25a0 broad access to various markets via standardized debt programs: for example, at the end of 2023, this included a maximum capacity of \u20ac6.0 billion of French commercial paper, $2.0 billion of US commercial paper, \u20ac20.0 billion under a Euro Medium Term Note ('EMTN') program (of which \u20ac17.3 billion have already been issued), and \u20ac1.5 billion of French titres n\u00e9gociables \u00e0 moyen terme ;\n- \u25a0 a debt profile characterized by debt that is mostly subordinated, with a long maturity profile. In 2023, AXA SA reimbursed \u20ac0.4 billion of debt (net of issuances) and consolidated debt stood at \u20ac18.8 billion at year-end 2023. Debt gearing (1) decreased by 1.4 pts in 2023 (20.3% at year-end 2023, versus 21.7 % (2) a t year-end 2022), driven by Net Income appropriation over the period (net of shareholders distributions), a decrease in the stock of debt and an increase in OCI. Interest coverage increased (17.2x (3 ) at year-end 2023, versus 15.6x (4 ) at year-end 2022) .\n\nAXA has put in place a robust liquidity Risk Management framework which is reviewed on a regular basis through a quarterly monitoring of liquidity and solvency requirements in stressed environments both at local and Group level. For additional information, please refer to Section 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management' (5 ) and Section 5.5 'Liquidity risk' (6 ) of this Annual Report.\n\nAt year-end 2023, Group entities held, in the aggregate, more than \u20ac172 billion of government and related bonds of which \u20ac101 billion were issued by Eurozone countries, which enables them to address local liquidity needs through highly liquid assets. AXA SA maintained a pool of liquid resources pertaining to its role as holding company of the AXA Group, consisting of cash, money market instruments (including through the Group's cash pooling) and highly liquid fixed income investments as well as, following its transformation into a regulated reinsurer, a portfolio of investments backing its statutory reinsurance liabilities. AXA SA also maintained available credit facilities at \u20ac8.0 billion at year-end 2023 (\u20ac7.9 billion in 2022). AXA SA has its own liquidity\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrequirements resulting mainly from solvency needs of entities under severe stress scenarios, its central reinsurance activities following the transformation of the Group's holding into the Group's main reinsurance captive and collateralized derivatives held by AXA SA. This derivatives book is monitored and managed on a daily basis by the Treasury Department. For additional information on the currencies in which our cash and cash equivalents are held, please refer to paragraph 'Exchange-Rate Risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries' in Section 5.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the extent to which our borrowings are at fixed rates, please refer to Note 11.1.1 'Change in shareholders' equity Group share in 2023', Note 15 'Financing Debt' and Note 16.2 'Other Debt Instruments Issued, Notes and Bank Overdra/f\\_t s (Other than Financing Debt) by Issuance' in Section 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nFor additional information on the use of financial instruments for hedging purposes, please refer to Note 18 'Derivative instruments' in Part 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, as part of its risk control framework, the Company remains vigilant regarding contractual provisions, such as rating triggers or restrictive covenants in financing and other documentation that may give lenders, securityholders or other counterparties the right to accelerate repayment, demand collateral or seek other similar remedies under circumstances that could have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Group's consolidated financial position. At year-end 2023, AXA had no rating triggers and no financial covenants in its credit facilities.\n\n## SUBORDINATED DEBT\n\nOn a consolidated basis, subordinated debt that qualifies as financing debt amounted to \u20ac11,020 million as of December 31, 2023 a/f\\_t er taking into account all intra-group eliminations and excluding undated subordinated debt that qualifies as equity (Undated deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (TSS/TSDI)), which are included in shareholders' equity, as described in Note 1.13.2 'Undated subordinated debt' in Section 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report), compared to \u20ac12,069 million as of December 31, 2022, thus showing a decrease of \u20ac1,048 million mainly driven by \u20ac1,000 million debt reimbursed.",

A failure of the Group and/or any of its (re)insurance entities to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements and/or a severe deterioration of its solvency position may result in the need for significant amounts of new capital. If such a failure occurs at any of the Group's (re)insurance subsidiaries, it could adversely a/ff ect the Group's liquidity position. For additional information, see paragraph 'The Group's or its reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' (2) of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group and AXA SA on a solo basis maintained eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement at all times during 2023 (in the case of AXA SA, subsequent to its receipt of its reinsurance license) and monitors compliance with such requirement on a continuous basis.\n\n## GROUP CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nFollowing the announcement of its ' Unlock the Future ' 20242026 strategic plan on February 22, 2024, the AXA Group's capital management policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u25a0 AXA intends to pay dividends annually for an amount representing a payout ratio of 60% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per Share (UEPS). The Dividend Per Share in a given year is targeted to be at least equal to the dividend paid in the prior year;\n- \u25a0 AXA intends to buy back shares annually in an amount corresponding to 15% of the Group's UEPS, representing, together with the Dividend Per Share, a total target payout ratio of 75% of the Group's UEPS;\n- \u25a0 the share buy-back component may be cancelled by the Group on the occurrence of a significant earnings event ( i.e ., a significant deviation in the Group's Underlying Earnings). The dividend floor set at the prior year level may be cancelled by the Group on the occurrence of a significant capital event ( i.e ., an event that significantly deteriorates the Group's solvency).\n- \u25a0 AXA applies strict financial discipline in its use of the Group's financial resources, with the following order of priority primarily driven by the AXA Group's capital management policy: (i ) payment of the annual dividend; (ii ) execution of annual share buy-backs; and (iii ) investment in inorganic growth. AXA further intends to buy back shares to neutralize the dilution resulting from employee share o/ff erings and stock-based compensation as well as to neutralize the dilutive impact of disposals and in-force management transactions on the Group's Underlying Earnings per share (such share buy-backs would be in addition to the annual share buy-backs mentioned above corresponding to a targeted 15% of the Group's UEPS).\n\nIn all cases, the Board of Directors has full discretion to determine the dividend to be proposed to the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting, as well as decide to buy back ordinary shares of the Company (pursuant to the annual shareholders' resolutions in this respect), based on a variety of factors (including AXA's earnings, financial condition, applicable capital and solvency requirements, prevailing operating and financial market conditions and the general economic environment).\n\nThe AXA Group has defined and implemented capital management standards in order to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries are well positioned from a competitive point of view and maintain an adequate solvency ratio in accordance with local regulatory requirements. In addition, Management has developed various contingency plans. These plans may involve the use of reinsurance, sales of investment portfolios and/or other assets, measures to reduce capital strain of new business, or other measures. There can be no assurance, however, that these plans will be e/ff ective and achieve their objectives\n\nIf the Group's Solvency II ratio were to deteriorate excessively, the AXA Group may take measures to improve it, such as being more selective on growth initiatives, increasing reinsurance or reducing its appetite for investment risk. In all cases, AXA's policy is to maintain its Group Solvency II ratio above its risk appetite limit level of 140%.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## TIERING ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL\n\nSolvency II Eligible Own Funds ('EOF') relate to the Group's and AXA SA's (on a solo basis) available capital resources before the impact of any tiering eligibility restrictions and a/f\\_t er consideration of the potential non-availability of certain elements of capital.\n\nEligible Own Funds are split into three di/ff erent tiers, based on the quality of each component as defined under Solvency II regulations. The classification depends upon the extent to which the own fund item is immediately available to absorb losses including in case of a winding-up (permanent availability) and subordinated to all other obligations including towards policyholders and beneficiaries. Capital elements of the highest quality are classified in Tier 1. Eligibility limits apply to these components to cover the Group's and AXA SA's (on a solo basis) Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR').\n\nFor compliance with the SCR, the following quantitative limits apply: (a) the eligible amount of Tier 1 items must be at least one half of the SCR, (b) the eligible amount of Tier 3 items must be less than 15% of the SCR, and (c) the sum of the eligible amounts of Tier 2 and Tier 3 items must not exceed 50% of the SCR.\n\nHybrid debt instruments eligible for Tier 1 must not exceed 20% of the total amount of Tier 1 capital.\n\n## DATED AND UNDATED SUBORDINATED DEBT DESCRIPTION\n\nDated and undated subordinated notes issued by the Company qualify as eligible own funds.\n\nSubordinated notes issued by the Company since January 18, 2015, have been structured to be eligible as own funds regulatory capital under Solvency II regulations. Subordinated notes issued prior to January 17, 2015, mostly benefit from the transitional provisions set forth in Directive 2014/51/EU (Omnibus II), which amended the Solvency II Directive, as they were previously eligible under the Solvency I regime and were issued prior to the entry into force of Delegated Regulation EU 2015/35 of October 10, 2014.\n\nThe Company has issued dated subordinated notes ('TSR'), undated subordinated notes ('TSDI') and undated deeply subordinated notes ('TSS'), which include provisions designed to allow the Company to ensure the continuity of its activities in the event that its financial position deteriorates.\n\nCertain TSR include clauses which permit or force the Company to defer interest payments. In addition, redemption at maturity is subject to (i) the prior approval by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), and (ii) the absence of any event (a) making the own funds of the Company and/or the Group insu/ff icient to cover its regulatory capital requirements, or (b) pursuant to which the Company would have to take\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.4 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nspecified action in relation to payments under the notes due to its financial condition, or (c) having an adverse e/ff ect on its insurance subsidiaries' claim payments ability.\n\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of AXA's TSDI, the Company may, at its option, under certain circumstances and shall, in other circumstances, defer interest payment ( e.g ., no dividend declared or paid in the preceding Annual Shareholders' Meeting or receipt by the Company or by certain of its principal insurance subsidiaries of a regulatory demand to restore its or their solvency position as the case may be). Payment of deferred interest may become due in certain specified cases ( e.g ., payment of a dividend, notification of the end of a regulatory demand to restore solvency, liquidation of the Company or redemption of the TSDI).\n\nIn particular, most of the Company's TSS (and all the TSS issued under the Solvency II regime (Restricted Tier 1) (1) ) include loss absorption mechanisms which provide that under certain circumstances where the Company and/or the Group does not meet its regulatory capital requirements, the principal amount of each of the relevant TSS will be written down. In such event, interest will become payable on the reduced principal amount only. The principal may be reinstated when the Company and/or the Group returns to financial health, as defined under the terms and conditions of the TSS.\n\nFor most of the Company's TSS issued under the Solvency 2 regime, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's consolidated net earnings and shareholders' equity, the Company is required to defer payment of interest. In such events, the Company may choose to pay such deferred interest by way of alternative coupon settlement mechanisms within five years (such as, issuance of new shares or other securities including TSS or preference shares, sale of treasury shares, or an increase in the principal amount of the relevant notes, subject to applicable limits), failing which the interest is forfeited. However, the settlement of deferred interest becomes due, on a best-e/ff orts basis, in certain circumstances including redemption of the notes, liquidation of the Company, payment of a dividend or interest on any other TSS, any share buy-back outside the Company's buy-back program, or any redemption or repurchase of other TSS.\n\nUnder its TSS issued under the Solvency 1 regime, the Company has an option to cancel payments of interest upon the deterioration of its financial position, unless certain events have occurred in the preceding year ( e.g ., a dividend payment or interest payment on any TSS, any share buy-back outside the Group share buy-back program or a repurchase or redemption of any TSS).\n\nIn addition, under its TSS issued under the Solvency 2 regime, the Company is required to cancel payment of interest in certain circumstances, including but not limited to when the Company and/or the Group does not meet (or is expected not to meet) its regulatory capital requirement, or when the Company distributable items are insu/ff icient, as defined under the terms and conditions of such TSS. Furthermore, the Company has full discretion to cancel payment of interest in respect of such TSS.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

The new strategic plan aims at growing and strengthening the Group's core businesses, notably by:\n\n- \u25a0 driving profitable organic growth through selective expansion in our core businesses and growing distribution;\n- \u25a0 scaling technical excellence by using data analytics to improve pricing, claims, and risk selection, and expanding prevention services; and\n- \u25a0 delivering operational excellence through automation, o/ff  shoring, and use of data and artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the period 2024 to 2026, AXA will seek to deliver profitable organic growth and scale technical excellence across each of its businesses, Property and Casualty Commercial lines, Employee Benefits and individual Health, and Retail Property and Casualty as well as Life, while driving operational excellence across its entire organization.\n\nIn addition, the new strategic plan includes the following main financial targets:\n\n- \u25a0 underlying earnings per share compounded annual growth rate over 2023 to 2026 estimated between 6% and 8%;\n- \u25a0 underlying return on equity between 14% and 16% over 2024 estimated to 2026 estimated; and\n- \u25a0 over \u20ac21 billion cumulative organic cash upstream over 2024 estimated to 2026 estimated.\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.6 OUTLOOK\n\nUnderlying earnings growth is expected to be driven by strong operating performance across our lines of business as well as a recovery in UK Health and margin improvement in Property and Casualty Retail. Earnings growth is expected to be achieved even a/f\\_t er taking into account headwinds from (i) the unwind of the discount (1) in Property and Casualty, (ii) lower interest rates compared to 2023 average levels, (iii) claims inflation only expected to normalize by 2025, (iv) moderation of Property and Casualty Commercial line pricing, (v) a higher Nat Cat load (2) , and (vi) the introduction of the OECD tax reform.\n\nThe Group has increased its underlying return on equity target, reflecting the high quality of its businesses, which is expected to drive book value growth.\n\nThe Group has significantly increased its ambition of cumulative cash upstream from \u20ac14 billion between 2021 and 2023 to above \u20ac21 billion over 2024 to 2026. The Group aims to achieve an organic cash remittance ratio (3) of approximately 80% over 2024 to 2026, with all businesses expected to deliver excellent remittance levels.\n\nThe Group also expects to continue to operate with its Solvency II ratio (4) at a high level, benefiting from 25 to 30 points of normalized Solvency II operating capital generation per annum , and limited sensitivity to interest rates and very adverse shocks (5) .\n\nThe Group intends to maintain a stable debt stock, with flexibility within its Debt Gearing target of 19 to 23 points.\n\nFinally, as part of the new strategic plan, AXA formalized a new capital management policy in its press release entitled 'AXA announces its 2024-2026 strategy, setting ambitious new financial targets', available on axa.com.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

In this context, AXA chose to adopt, in 2008, the corporate governance Code for French corporations (Code de gouvernement d'entreprises des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es) published by the Afep (Association fran\u00e7aise des entreprises priv\u00e9es) and the Medef (Mouvement des entreprises de France) (the 'Afep-Medef Code'). The Board of Directors (or the 'Board') believes that AXA's corporate governance practices are in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code (revised in December 2022 and available on AXA's website - www.axa.com) and its accompanying guide. In addition, the Board of Directors monitors the evolution of corporate governance practices in France and abroad, as well as the recommendations and standards of shareholders, regulators, the French High Committee for corporate governance ( Haut Comit\u00e9 de gouvernement d'entreprise ), proxy advisors, rating agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF AXA'S GOVERNANCE\n\n## AXA's corporate governance framework\n\nSince April 2010, AXA has operated with a unitary Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board is assisted by three Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Finance & Risk Committee and the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe Board has adopted terms of reference (the 'Board's Terms of Reference') which notably detail the role and responsibilities of the Board and its Committees, as well as matters reserved for Board decisions. The Board's Terms of Reference include corporate governance requirements which, in certain instances, go beyond current French regulatory requirements notably in relation to the number of independent directors on Board Committees.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nIn 2016, when Mr. Thomas Buberl was appointed Chief Executive O/ff icer, the Board of Directors decided to split the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/ff icer, in line with the recommendations of the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution ('ACPR') and the expectations of shareholders. In April 2022, when the mandate of Mr. Denis Duverne as Chairman of the Board of Directors expired, the Board decided to keep the positions split and (i) appoint Mr. Antoine GossetGrainville, independent director of AXA since 2020, as Chairman of the Board in replacement of Mr. Denis Duverne, and (ii) re-appoint Mr. Thomas Buberl as Chief Executive O/ff icer for 4 years. The Board of Directors decided to grant Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville, who had worked closely with Mr. Denis Duverne for over a year prior to his appointment,  similar powers to those of Mr. Denis Duverne.\n\nA description of the Chairman's broad responsibilities and a report on his activities during the 2023 fiscal year are provided in Section 'Chairman of the Board of Directors' on pages 92 and 93 below.\n\nWith Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville's mandate as director expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of April 23, 2024, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decided to continue to split the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer, in line with the ACPR's recommendations as well as best governance practices and given it considers that this form of governance is best suited for the Group's situation and challenges. In this context, the Board of Directors decided to (i) propose the renewal of Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville's mandate as director to the Shareholders' Meeting of April 23, 2024 and (ii) subject to the renewal of his mandate, renew him as Chairman of the Board, with the same powers as previously granted to him. This decision was taken in light of the complementary profiles and experiences of Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville and Mr. Thomas Buberl, as well as the quality of the governance in place both within the Board of Directors and when interacting with the Executive Management ( Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale ), as illustrated by the results of the annual assessment of the Board carried out in 2023 by an independent consultant (see Section 'Self-assessment of the Board of Directors' activities' on page 94 below).",

An overview of the Board of Directors as well as the profile, experience and expertise of each director is provided on pages 81 to 88 to of this Annual Report.\n\n## Board of Directors' Diversity Policy\n\nPursuant to A rticle L.22-10-10, 2\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), the diversity policy applicable to Board members is described below.\n\n## POLICY STATEMENT\n\nIn an increasingly complex and highly competitive global environment, it is important for AXA to have directors with diverse and complementary profiles, skills and experience to drive its current and future strategy and development.\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that such diversity is essential for the Board to function optimally, and that diversity is a source of creativity and performance. It also broadens the analytical perspective of the issues discussed at Board meetings.\n\nConsequently, in view of the Group's global presence, the Board of Directors, assisted by its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, has set a target to have Board members with diverse nationalities and cultures to ensure a balanced and complementary Board, taking into account criteria such as gender, tenure, age, independence, skills, expertise and experience.\n\nThe purpose of this diversity policy is to ensure that, at all times, the Board of Directors is consistently made up of directors with complementary skills and experience and collectively able to support the Group's Senior Management in executing its strategic plan and defining long-term objectives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Board of Directors notably considered the specific situation of Mrs. Angelien Kemna. Consistent with its assessment in past years, the Board of Directors concluded that the fact that she sits on the Board of AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) as non-executive director does not impair her independence under the Afep-Medef Code. In particular, the Board considered that this role does not prevent Mrs. Angelien Kemna from exercising her mandate as a director of AXA with complete independence because (i) AXA IM is an unlisted 97% owned subsidiary of the Group, and (ii) any potential conflicts that may arise are manageable by Mrs. Angelien Kemna abstaining from any debate and/or vote on the matter in question, in line with the Board's Terms of Reference. Finally, the Board considered that, in her capacity as a director of AXA IM, she brings to the Board useful and precise knowledge of the strategy, operations, processes and teams of AXA IM and more generally on the Group's a sset m anagement activities.\n\nThe Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors also assessed the materiality of the business relationships between independent Board members and the Company. In this context the Board: (1) reviewed the declaration Board members provide to the Company each year detailing their business relationships with the Group over the past year and\n\nconfirming that these relationships do not create any potential conflicts of interests and (2) analyzed from a qualitative and quantitative perspective the business relationship, notably based on the following criteria: (i) the nature of the relationship: they considered the position of the Board member in the contracting organization ( i.e. , does he/she have specific decision-making powers which could impact the relationship or does he/she get paid in this regard); and (ii) the significance of the relationship: they ensured that the business relationships do not represent a significant part of the Group's revenues or lead to dependency or exclusivity. The Board concluded that none of the independent Board members had business relationships with the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries that are material at the level of the Group or that could call into question their independence.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer (Mr. Thomas Buberl), the member of the Board representing the employee shareholders (currently Mrs. Helen Browne) and the members of the Board representing the employees (currently Mrs. Martine Bi\u00e8vre and Mrs. Bettina Cramm), are by definition not independent.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Board of Directors concluded that 10 out of 16 Board members are considered as independent under the Afep-Medef Code: Mrs. Clotilde Delbos, Mrs. Rachel Duan, Mrs. Isabel Hudson, Mrs. Angelien Kemna, Mrs. Rachel Picard, Mrs. Marie-France Tschudin, Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville, Mr. Guillaume Faury, Mr. Ramon Fernandez and Mr. Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oisPoncet.\n\nAXA\n\nI\n\nI",

In addition, the Board inter alia:\n\n- \u25a0 chooses the appropriate corporate governance framework;\n- \u25a0 appoints and dismisses the Chairman, any Vice-Chairman/ Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive O/ff icer, any Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer (Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9) , any dirigeant effectif (as defined under the Solvency II regulation);\n- \u25a0 determines the compensation the Chief Executive O/ff icer and any Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer ( Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 );\n- \u25a0 convenes Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u25a0 proposes directors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and/or coopts directors to the Board;\n- \u25a0 reviews and sets (arr\u00eate) the Company's and the Group's halfyear and annual financial statements;\n- \u25a0 presents a report on corporate governance to the Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u25a0 decides to grant stock-options and/or performance/restricted shares;\n- \u25a0 authorizes agreements referred to in A rticle L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code ( conventions r\u00e9glement\u00e9es );\n- \u25a0 fulfills all the obligations entrusted to it under Solvency II regulations;\n- \u25a0 sets the risk appetite and overall risk tolerance limits for AXA SA;\n- \u25a0 reviews the strategies and the policies on the taking, management and monitoring of risks as well as the conclusions of the internal assessment of risks and solvency (ORSA - Own Risk and Solvency Assessment - report);\n- \u25a0 adopts and oversees the general principles of the Group Remuneration Policy; and\n- \u25a0 proposes Statutory Auditors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and approves non-audit services.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who is also a Board member, is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company and to represent the Company in its relationships\n\nwith third parties. However, the Board of Directors has reserved the right to approve certain material transactions as set out in the Board's Terms of Reference, including disposals or acquisitions over \u20ac500 million per transaction or \u20ac2 billion in aggregate in any single year), granting of sureties, guarantees, endorsements and warrantees in favor of third parties (over \u20ac200 (1) /100 (2) million per transaction or \u20ac1 billion in aggregate in any single year), material financing transactions and any material transaction outside the strategy announced by the Company.\n\nTo ensure that the personal interests of the members of the Board of Directors and those of the Company are appropriately aligned, the Board's Terms of Reference provide that each member of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the directors representing the employees) must hold, within two years following his/her first appointment, a number of AXA shares with a value at least equal to the gross annual amount of his/her compensation (directors' fees) earned in respect of the previous fiscal year (3) .\n\n## CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn accordance with French law, the Chairman's role is to organize and oversee the work of the Board of Directors. In this context, he sets the agenda of the Board meetings, holds regular discussions with the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the directors, requests any document or information necessary to help the Board of Directors for the preparation of its meetings, ensures that the documents are provided early enough to enable directors to have the time to examine the documents and verifies the quality of the information provided. More generally, he ensures that Board members are in a position to fulfill their role.\n\nThe Chairman convenes the members of the Board without directors who are members of the Executive Management (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) being present, in particular to debate their performance, compensation and succession planning.\n\nFollowing its decision to appoint Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville as Chairman of the Board of Directors in April 2022 and considering his experience and extensive knowledge of the AXA Group, the Board decided to extend the duties entrusted to its Chairman to include the following (4) :\n\n- \u25a0 promoting the Company's values and culture in particular in relation to sustainability and professional ethics;\n- \u25a0 upon request by the Chief Executive O/ff icer, representing the Company in its relations, nationally and internationally, with public bodies, institutions, regulators, shareholders and the Company's main strategic partners and stakeholders;\n\nI\n\nI",

Under French law, the Chief Executive O/ff icer is solely responsible for the Company's operational leadership and management.\n\n## SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR\n\nMr. Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, Board member and Senior Independent Director, whose term of o/ff ice expired at the close of the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting, was not replaced. The Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decided not to maintain the position of Senior Independent Director further to the appointment of an independent director, Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville, as Chairman of the Board.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.1 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nIn 2023 (until the term of his mandate on April 27, 2023), the Senior Independent Director, who also acted as Chairman of the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee:\n\n- \u25a0 maintained regular dialogue with the Chairman of the Board and with the Executive Management ( i.e., the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icers (Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux Adjoints) );\n- \u25a0 was actively involved in the preparation of Board and Committees meetings, working closely with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management; and\n- \u25a0 contributed to the review of all communications made to shareholders on corporate governance topics and Executive Management compensation and participated in corporate governance roadshows with major shareholders/investors prior to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nHe reported on his activities at the Shareholders' Meeting held on April 27, 2023.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors met ten times and the directors held three executive sessions without the presence of the Executive Management ( i.e. , the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the two Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icers (Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux Adjoints) ).\n\nIn 2023, the Board notably focused on:\n\n- \u25a0 the preparation of the new Group s trategic p lan 2024-2026 (see further details below);\n- \u25a0 the Group's s ustainability strategy, of which the climate strategy is an essential element, (see Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report);\n- \u25a0 the examination of the 2022 consolidated and statutory financial statements and the 2023 half-year consolidate d financial statements;\n- \u25a0 capital management;\n- \u25a0 significant disposal and acquisition projects;\n- \u25a0 Board Committee reports;\n- \u25a0 the Solvency II reports for both the Group and AXA SA including the ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment), SFCR (Solvency and Financial Condition Report), RSR (Regular Supervisory Report) and Internal Model validation report as well as written policies;\n- \u25a0 the Group's Pre-emptive Recovery Plan;\n- \u25a0 the reinsurance strategy;\n- \u25a0 the approval of non-audit services;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This discussion was followed up at successive Committees and Board meetings before being formally approved in February 2024.\n\nIn 2023, several training sessions were organized by the Chairman of the Board, led by external and/or AXA Group presenters on (i) digitalization for an e/ff icient and sustainable future, (ii) the Generative Artificial Intelligence, (iii) the implementation of the IFRS 17 accounting standards and (iv) science and climate change (provided by AXA Climate).\n\n## SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF/uni202FDIRECTORS' ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual self-assessment to review its composition, operating procedures, and overall functioning. The conclusions of this self-assessment are discussed annually.\n\nIn 2022, the Board self-assessment was conducted internally, and all directors (except the Chairman of the Board) answered a self-assessment questionnaire and had a meeting with the Chairman of the Board to assess the e/ff ectiveness of the Board and each Board member's contribution. The conclusions of each director's personal contribution were shared by the Chairman of the Board who provided individual feedback during dedicated one-on-one meetings with each Board member. Each director also had a meeting with the Chairman of the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee to collect his/her feedback and suggestions on the personal contribution of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn 2023, the Board's self-assessment was carried out by an external consultant (Russell Reynolds Associates), under the supervision of the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee. This consultant was selected among several providers following a request for proposal considering notably the following criteria: (i) experience in board assessment, (ii) independence, (iii) knowledge of the industry, etc.\n\nEach director completed an online questionnaire, and then met with the external consultant to assess, in particular (i) the progress made against the conclusions of the previous self-assessment in 2022, (ii) the composition and the functioning of the Board and its Committees, (iii) the role of the Chairman, (iv) the relationship between the Board and the Management and (v) the alignment of the Board with the Group's strategy, particularly in terms of sustainability.\n\nDuring the individual interviews, the directors were also asked to comment on the other members' individual contribution to the Board's work.\n\nAll results were anonymous, and the directors received individual feedback from the Chairman of the Board on their respective contributions.\n\nDuring its December 2023 meeting, the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee thoroughly reviewed the conclusions of the Board self-assessment as well as the main areas for improvement before submission to the Board of Directors on December 6, 2023.\n\nThe 2023 self-assessment demonstrated that the directors' perception of the overall functioning of the Board of Directors, including its dynamics and its performance, is very positive. The directors also recognized and valued the significant contribution of the Chair to the Board notably his inclusive leadership style and his ability to foster an open debate.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors also recognized the significant progress made by the Board following the recommendations presented in 2022.\n\nThe members of the Board identified notably the following areas for improvements:\n\n- \u25a0 adding insurance expertise to the Board in the next rounds of appointments;\n- \u25a0 creating a comprehensive long-term agenda to examine strategic and business topics in depth;\n- \u25a0 reviewing the M&A approval process; and\n- \u25a0 operationalizing the division of responsibilities for sustainability between the three Committees and the Board.",

However, under French law, Board Committees do not have any formal decision-making power and are advisory only.\n\nThe Committees may request external consulting expertise if necessary. They may also invite external participants to attend their meetings.\n\nAll Committees are composed of members with expertise in the relevant areas, and their composition is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe role, organization and responsibilities of each Committee are set out in the Board's Terms of Reference and in the AXA Group Audit Committee Terms of Reference available on AXA's website.",

In this context, its main objective is to encourage the achievement of ambitious objectives and the creation of long-term value by setting challenging performance criteria.\n\nAXA's executive compensation structure is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices in France and abroad, within the financial services sector (insurance and reinsurance companies, banks, asset managers, etc.) and of other international groups.\n\nAXA Group's overall policy on executive compensation focuses on the variable part of the compensation package, which is the compensation at risk for beneficiaries. The structure of AXA's executive compensation is composed of a variable portion which represents a significant part of the aggregate compensation. This is designed to align executive compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders while encouraging performance:\n\n- \u25a0 both on an individual and collective level; and\n- \u25a0 over the short, medium, and long term.\n\n| Individual Skills   | Individual  Performance   | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   |              |                      |                            |                                  |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                     |                           |                       |                          |                          |              |                      |                            | Performance  Shares              |\n|                     |                           |                       |                          |                          |              |                      | Deferred Variable          |                                  |\n|                     |                           |                       |                          |                          | Fixed Salary |                      |                            |                                  |\n|                     |                           |                       |                          |                          | Current      | Short term  (1 year) | Medium term  (2 - 4 years) | Medium - Long  term (3 -5 years) |\n\nI\n\nI",

Their independence is assessed annually by the Board in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Afep-Medef Code. The Chairman presents the compensation policy of the Company each year at the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Committee meets frequently with the Group Executives and the departments of the Company including Group H uman R esources and Group Legal. The Committee is empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews and to use external consulting expertise to the extent deemed appropriate. Thus, during the last few years, the Committee worked several times with a compensation-consulting firm in order to benefit from external technical expertise and an independent overview in order to compare AXA's variable compensation practices with general market practices.\n\n## AXA Group Remuneration Policy\n\nIn line with Solvency II regulations, the Group Remuneration Policy, applicable to all AXA employees, is designed to support the Group's Long-Term Business strategy and to align the interests of its employees with those of other stakeholders by (i) establishing a clear link between performance and remuneration over the short, medium and long term, (ii) ensuring that the Group can o/ff  er competitive compensation arrangements across the multiple markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii) ensuring compliance with Solvency II regulations and any other applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group Remuneration Policy is designed to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract, develop, and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 drive superior performance;\n- \u25a0 align compensation levels with business performance;\n- \u25a0 ensure that employees are not incentivized to take inappropriate and/or excessive risks and that they operate within AXA's overall risk framework; and\n- \u25a0 ensure compliance of the Group's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n- It follows four main guiding principles:\n- \u25a0 competitiveness and market consistency of the remuneration practices;\n- \u25a0 fairness based on individual and collective performance, in order to ensure remuneration is reflecting employees' individual quantitative and qualitative achievements and impact;\n- \u25a0 internal equity based on remuneration policies and procedures designed to ensure that employees are paid equitably based on objective and justifiable professional criteria (such as, but not limited to, role, skills, contribution or impact), and do not discriminate on the basis of factors irrelevant to duties of the role;\n- \u25a0 achievement of the Group's overall financial and extra-financial, as well as operational objectives over the short, medium, and long term and execution against medium and long-term strategic objectives as a prerequisite to fund any mid-to-long term award.\n\nThe requirements set out in the Group Remuneration Policy may be supplemented in order to comply with local regulatory requirements or best practices. The Policy is reviewed and updated annually to mirror, as the case may be, changes in the internal organization and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to AXA's business and to reflect exchanges with the French insurance regulator ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR)).\n\n## Remuneration structure\n\nAXA applies a pay-for-performance approach which (i) promotes long-term sustainable performance by incorporating risk adjustment mechanisms in variable compensation schemes, and (ii) recognizes employees who bring the greatest value to the Group on the basis of financial results while demonstrating individual leadership and behaviors. The intent of this approach is to attract and retain the best skills and talents, to foster employee engagement and to strengthen AXA's leadership.\n\n3",

Fixed remuneration primarily reflects the relevant organizational responsibility, professional experience, technical and leadership skills required of the role, criticality, or scarcity of skills, as well as the individual's capability to sustainably perform the duties of the role;\n- \u25a0 a variable component which primarily reflects the business and individual performance, including performance in excess of that required to fulfil the role description. It comprises an upfront cash element (annual cash bonus) and a deferred element recognizing the importance of aligning remuneration over long-term value creation. The deferred element is awarded through Performance Shares. This variable component depends on the Group's global performance, on the beneficiary's operating business performance, and on the achievement of the executive's individual objectives including demonstrated abilities for leadership. The variable portion is designed to represent a substantial component of the executive's global compensation and, where an executive attains or exceeds the set objectives, to position the compensation levels of AXA executives between the median and the third quartile (or, in certain cases, beyond the third quartile) of the market reference.\n\nThe target level of the executives' compensation and the structure of the elements which compose such compensation are based on a detailed analysis of market practices as well as potential applicable national and international regulations, and also take into consideration various other factors including the equity principles within the Group and the previous individual compensation level of the executive.\n\nEach year, AXA, with the assistance of specialized firms, conducts compensation reviews in order to ensure the competitiveness and consistency of executives' compensation and to measure the suitability of the remuneration policies. In this context, three markets are used as a reference:\n\n- \u25a0 a first market composed of 12 companies in the French CAC 40 index (companies selected to form the panel, which may vary from year-to-year, which are comparable to AXA in terms of stock capitalization, revenues, sector, number of employees and/or geographic coverage);\n- \u25a0 a second market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in terms of size and s cope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance and reinsurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the main European markets (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland);\n- \u25a0 a third market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in terms of size and s cope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance and reinsurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the United States and Asia.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Annual cash compensation\n\n## TOTAL TARGET COMPENSATION\n\n## Total target compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, has decided to maintain unchanged in 2023 the total annual cash compensation target of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, Mr. Thomas Buberl, at \u20ac3,400,000.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's total target compensation is composed of a fixed annual compensation and a target annual variable compensation.\n\nThe fixed annual compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer amounts to \u20ac1,650,000 and his annual target variable compensation amounts to \u20ac1,750,000, i.e. 106% of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that, in accordance with the Company's past practice, this compensation package would remain unchanged for the Chief Executive O/ff icer's entire term of o/ff ice ( i.e., until April 2026). When establishing the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation package, the Board therefore made sure that it was balanced and aligned with the interests of the shareholders in order for it to remain competitive throughout this period.\n\nThe total amount of compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the balance between its di/ff erent components (fixed and variable) are mainly based on a study by an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) on compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC 40 companies as well as AXA's main European and international competitors (insurance and reinsurance companies, banks), and follows the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the G20, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board in terms of compensation.\n\n## Total compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon proposal from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decided to maintain unchanged the amount of Mr. Antoine Gosset-Grainville's fixed annual compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors at \u20ac925,000 for 2023.\n\nThe Board of Directors upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee and pursuant to the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code considered that the compensation structure best suited for the Chairman of the Board of Directors was a sole fixed annual compensation, and therefore decided that the Chairman of the Board of Directors would not be entitled to any variable compensation, nor any remuneration as per article L.22-10-14 of the French C ommercial Code (D irectors' fees), performance shares or other long-term compensation, nor would he benefit from any other form of compensation.\n\nIn order to determine the Chairman of the Board of Directors' fixed annual compensation, the Board of Directors consulted an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) regarding compensation practices for similar positions in CAC 40 companies and the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks).",

This metric is measured based on (i) U nderlying Earnings per share, (ii) cash remittance, (iii) a sustainability indicator (reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets), and (iv) the Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). The relative weight of each indicator is respectively 45%, 25%, 15% and 15%.\n\nThe evolution of the choice and weight of the financial and extra-financial indicators of the Group performance is part of a global review destined to simplify and closer align this performance with the Group's strategic orientations, while taking into account regulatory constraints, including the further weight of extra-financial elements.\n\nThe financial and extra-financial indicators chosen to measure the Group performance are directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. They reflect objectives for growth, capital management, sustainability and customer proximity and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target.\n\nSome of these indicators (U nderlying Earnings per share and cash remittance) are identical to share-based compensation indicators, in order to align part of the performance criteria of the short- and long-term compensation with the objectives of the strategic plan and to measure them on di/ff erent time scales through di/ff erent acquisition schedules.\n\n- \u25a0 Individual performance for 30%, which is evaluated based on objectives specifically related to strategic initiatives set and reviewed each year.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer's individual performance is assessed based on (i) various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board of Directors in a target letter agreed at the beginning of the year, and (ii) demonstrated leadership abilities. The target letter includes detailed objectives related to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives assessing the achievement of global strategic initiatives and/or related to certain geographic areas, as well\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nas progress on investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations.\n\nTo evaluate Mr. Thomas Buberl's individual performance in 2023, the Board of Directors assessed the achievement of the following objectives set in his target letter:\n\n- \u00b7 Successfully deliver on the last year of ' Driving Progress 2023 ' strategic plan, especially on the financial targets and ESG objectives (achievement rate: 125%)\n\nOver the course of 2023, the Group successfully delivered on the last year of ' Driving Progress 2023 ', achieving the main financial targets over three years, including Underlying Earnings per share growing 9%, cumulative cash remittance of \u20ac16.4 billion, and at least \u20ac200 million of cost savings reflecting higher inflation, and investments in next plan's growth initiatives.\n\nThe Group established solid foundation for the future with a focus on completing the turnaround of AXA XL (Underlying Earnings of \u20ac1.9 billion in 2023, up 49% compared to 2022) and implementing promising growth initiatives such as the Commercial lines mid-market strategy and accelerating the Group's Employee Benefits business with a focus on customer experience and services o/ff ers.\n\nThe Group also defined and disclosed an ambitious Net Zero trajectory, including, in the insurance portfolio,\n\n(i) increasing business in the field of renewable energies as well as developing environmentally sustainable claims management for motor business by 2026, (ii) reducing the carbon intensity of the most material personal motor portfolios by 20% by 2030 compared with the 2019 baseline, and (iii) reducing the absolute carbon emissions of the Group's largest commercial insurance clients by 30% and the carbon intensity of other corporate clients by 20% by 2030\n\n- compared with the 2021 baseline.\n- \u00b7 Design AXA Group's new strategic plan 2024-2026 (achievement rate: 100%)\n\nThe Group designed the new strategic plan 2024-2026 which is driven by the following priorities: (i) local and transversal top line growth initiatives (50 initiatives investigated by entities and transversal teams), (ii) technical and operational excellence, (iii) new engagement on inclusive protection (notably in mature markets), (iv) new HR strategy (built on 'Dare & Care'), and (v) continued financial discipline.\n\n- \u00b7 Manage continued stability in the Management Committee with solid succession plans and drive progress on D&I amongst leadership teams (achievement rate: 125%)\n\nThe Group successfully managed the Management Committee succession plans together with associated organization adjustments.

The new Management Committee marks strong progress towards gender parity with 38% of women and has greater international diversity (with 9 nationalities represented) and generational diversity (ages ranging from 37 to 63). This reorganization highlights the strength of AXA's internal talent pipeline with all promotions sourced internally.\n\nFollowing this Management Committee reorganization, the Group also restructured its Partners Group (which is composed of the members of the Management Committee and close to thirty other senior executives of the Group) to focus it on the main P&L leaders across the Group. With this revamp, gender parity (48% women) was achieved in the Partners Group.\n\nIn AXA's 'Global Leadership Network' (GLN), the organization's top 250 executives, the Group achieved 40% of women, and the Management Committee members were coached to deliver on their specific plans to achieve higher diversity within their respective s copes. Overall, employees' engagement reached a record high level, with an eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score) of 40 in Q4 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to assess opportunities to optimize the perimeter of the Group, including in-force transactions, simplification initiatives and bolt-on acquisitions (achievement rate: 104%)\n\nThe Group executed several bolt-on acquisitions designed to reshape and build the Group for the future: (i) Credit Mutuelle's insurance business in Spain, (ii) Groupama's business in T\u00fcrkiye , and (iii) Laya Healthcare Limited in Ireland.\n\nI\n\nThe Group further focused its geographic footprint with the disposal of Bharti AXA Life (India) and continued to execute on its in-force strategy with a significant transaction negotiated in France.\n\nThe Group designed and implemented a new strategy and operating model for Asia including (i) a review of the current structure (Asia Markets o/ff ice) and leadership team; and (ii) a review of the ICBC-AXA joint venture, the potential launch of wealth management initiatives (AXA IM) and a reorganization of the governance of AXA's 'Greater China' operations.\n\nEach of these two metrics (Group Performance and Individual Performance) is evaluated separately so that the overall variable payout reflects performance against two distinct components assessed independently. Each of these two metrics is in any case capped at a 130% achievement rate.\n\nThe determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on the following additive formula: Variable compensation due = Target Variable compensation x (70% Group Performance +30% Individual Performance).\n\nSince the 2020 performance year, the weight of the Group Performance within the variable compensation assessment has increased to 70% (from 50% previously) leading to a decrease of the Individual Performance weight to 30%. Through this change, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, wanted to strengthen the formulaic/quantitative component of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable compensation, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors. Similarly, in order to take into account the comments of some institutional investors, the level of transparency of each Group Performance indicator has been improved to indicate not only the target for each criterion but also the relevant floor and cap as well as the actual level of payout.\n\nI",

The business performance score is calculated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 for MC members with Corporate responsibilities: (50% Group STIC score +50% Average of Operating Business STIC scores), subject to a possible Individual Performance Modifier;\n- \u25a0 for MC members with Operating Business responsibilities: (50% Group STIC score +50% Operating Business STIC score), subject to a possible Individual Performance Modifier.\n\nGroup performance is measured by the (i) U nderlying  Earnings per S hare, (ii) cash remittance, (iii) a sustainability indicator (reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets), and (iv) Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). Individual performance is evaluated considering predefined objectives specifically deriving from strategic initiatives.\n\nThe performance of operating businesses is notably determined based on the following performance indicators:\n\n- \u25a0 underlying earnings;\n- \u25a0 cash remittance;\n- \u25a0 Property & Casualty Commercial lines gross written premiums;\n- \u25a0 Health and Protection gross written premiums; and New Business Contractual Service Margin;\n- \u25a0 net promoter score; and\n- \u25a0 non-commission expenses.\n\nFor the 2023 performance year, indicators that measure the Group performance have been defined at the beginning of the year with:\n\n- \u25a0 a predefined target, aligned with the strategic plan (budget), the completion of which will result in 100% achievement;\n- \u25a0 a floor (at a pay-out of 70%), which defines the threshold below which no variable compensation for that component will be paid;\n- \u25a0 a cap (at a pay-out of 130%), which defines the threshold above which the variable compensation for that component is capped.\n\nThe individual performance modifier is determined based on both (i) the achievement of results for each predetermined individual objective and (ii) qualitative factors, including leadership skills demonstrated by the members of the Management Committee (quality of earnings/execution, collaboration, delivery on human resources objectives).\n\nIn the tables of this section, compensation not paid in Euro was converted into Euro on the basis of the following yearly average exchange rate for 2023: 1 USD = 0.9248 EUR.\n\nThe variable compensations paid to the Management Committee members for 2021, 2022 and 2023 were as follows:\n\n## VARIABLE COMPENSATION PAID TO MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n|                                                       |           | Variable compensation  for the year 2021   | Variable compensation  for the year 2021   | Variable compensation  for the year 2021   | Variable compensation  for the year 2022   | Variable compensation  for the year 2022   | Variable compensation  for the year 2022   | Variable compensation  for/uni202Fthe  year  2023   | Variable compensation  for/uni202Fthe  year  2023   | Variable compensation  for/uni202Fthe  year  2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                       |           |                                            |                                            | %                                          |                                            |                                            | %                                          |                                                     |                                                     | %                                                   |\n| (in Euro )                                            | Country   | Target                                     | Actual                                     | Target                                     | Target                                     | Actual                                     | Target                                     | Target                                              | Actual                                              | Target                                              |\n| Thomas Buberl Chief Executive O/ff icer               | France    | 1,450,000                                  | 1,722,600  (a)                             | 118.8%                                     | 1,653,014                                  | 1,832,366  (a)                             | 110.85%                                    | 1,750,000                                           | 1,981,000  (a)(b)                                   | 113.20%                                             |\n| Total of the other Management  Committee members  (c) | 8,738,958 |                                            | 10,029,609                                 | 114.8%                                     | 10,834,518                                 | 12,003,156                                 | 110.79%                                    | 10,213,951                                          | 11,629,264                                          | 113.86%                                             |\n\n## ANNUAL DEFERRED VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nSince 2013, the Board of Directors has implemented a deferral mechanism for 30% of the executive o/ff icers' variable compensation.\n\nAs of 2022, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decided to extend the deferral period from two years to three years to further align the executive o/ff icers' variable compensation with shareholder interests. The Board of Directors also decided to (i) eliminate the payout floor (previously set at 80% of the deferred\n\n- amount) to emphasize the 'at risk' nature of this component, and\n\nI\n\n- (ii) increase the payout cap (from 120% to 130%) in the event of superior share price performance.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the Chief Executive O/ff icer's deferred amount of annual e/ff ective variable compensation for the 2023 fiscal year will be paid out in three tranches, in 2025, 2026 and 2027. The actual amount to be paid will vary depending on the",

In this context, the number of LTIs granted is set so that the executives are between the median and the 75 th percentile of market references considering the global amount of the variable part (comprising one part in cash and one part in LTIs). The Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors however ensure that the Performance Shares granted to the Group executives and valued in accordance with IFRS standards are not disproportionate compared to the aggregate compensation and shares granted to the executives concerned.\n\nThese Performance Shares are integrally subject to performance conditions (please refer to pages 115 et seq .) and therefore do not guarantee any grant or minimal gain for the beneficiaries.\n\nAll the amounts presented in this Section 3.2 are gross amounts and before taxation.\n\n## SUMMARY OF COMPENSATION, OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED TO MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n## MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\n|                                                       | Year 2022                                             | Year 2022                                      | Year 2022                                    | Year 2022                                                | Year 2022                                                               | Year 2022   | Year 2023                                      | Year 2023                                                                                             | Year 2023                                                               | Year 2023      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| (in Euro )                                            | Country                                               | Compensation  granted in  respect  of the year | Value of  options  granted  during  the year | Value of  performance  shares  granted  during  the year | Value of  international  performance  shares  granted  during  the year | Total       | Compensation  granted in  respect of  the year | Value of  options  granted  during  the year Value of  performance  shares  granted  during  the year | Value of  international  performance  shares  granted  during  the year | Total          |\n| Thomas Buberl Chief Executive O/ff icer               | France                                                | 3,421,342  (a)                                 | -                                            | 1,910,398                                                | -                                                                       | 5,331,740   | 3,634,975  (a)                                 | - 2,835,384                                                                                           | -                                                                       | 6,470,360  (b) |\n| Total of the other Management  Committee members  (c) | Total of the other Management  Committee members  (c) | 23,981,808                                     | -                                            | 6,473,424                                                | 4,963,255                                                               | 35,418,487  | 21,963,273                                     | - 5,859,789                                                                                           | 4,434,173                                                               | 32,257,235     |\n\nOn each date of grant, the fair value of Performance Shares is determined in accordance with IFRS standards.

A fixed amount determined by the Board of Directors drawn on this total amount shall be paid annually to the Senior Independent Director (set at \u20ac80,000)\n\nNo directors' fees are paid by the Company to the corporate o/ff icers ( i.e., Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/ff icer).\n\nThe total annual maximum amount of directors' fees is determined by the Shareholders' Meeting, in accordance with applicable laws, and apportioned by the Board of Directors to its members.\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, a minority part of the fees is distributed evenly among the members of the Board of Directors as a fixed fee:\n\n- \u25a0 65% of the remaining amount (a/f\\_t er payment to the Senior Independent Director where applicable) shall be allocated to the Board as follows: 40% shall be divided equally among Board members and paid as a fixed fee, and 60% shall be paid according to Board attendance; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 the remaining 35% shall be allocated by the Board of Directors to the Board Committees. In 2023, 25% was allocated to the Finance & Risk Committee, 25% to the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, and 50% to the Audit Committee. Each Committee shall then allocate such amount to its members as follows: 40% shall be divided equally amongst members and paid as a fixed fee, and 60% shall be paid according to Committee attendance, with the Chair of the Committee receiving in each case a double fee.\n\nMrs. Helen Browne, member of the Board of Directors representing the employee shareholders of the AXA Group, received in 2023 an annual gross cash compensation of \u20ac1,060,223 in connection with her position as Group General Counsel. This compensation consists of \u20ac600,000 of fixed compensation and \u20ac460,223 of variable compensation.\n\nMrs. Angelien Kemna received in 2023 directors' fees of \u20ac90,000 in respect of her non-executive mandate in a Group subsidiary (AXA Investment Managers SA).\n\nIn 2023, Mr. G\u00e9rald Harlin received a gross amount of \u20ac211,513 with respect to his non-executive mandates in Group subsidiaries (AXA Investment Managers SA, AXA XL US, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie).\n\n## Shares subject to performance conditions (Performance shares and international performance shares, restricted shares and international restricted shares)\n\nShares subject to performance conditions are designed to recognize and motivate the Group's best talents and core skills by aligning the individuals' interests with the overall performance of the AXA Group, and the corresponding operational entity/ business unit as well as with the stock performance of the AXA share over the medium-long term. Shares subject to performance conditions generally result in low shareholder dilution due to the possibility to deliver existing shares, this choice being the one made up to this date.\n\nSince 2022, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, may grant Performance Shares to Senior Management (1) , including members of the Management Committee and Restricted Shares to other beneficiaries.\n\nPerformance Shares and Restricted Shares are usually granted to beneficiaries residing in France, while International Performance Shares and International Restricted Shares are generally granted to beneficiaries residing outside of France.\n\n## GRANT PROCEDURE\n\nWithin the multi-annual cap authorized by the Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors approves all programs of shares subject to performance conditions prior to their implementation.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors, acting upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, approves a pool of global performance shares to be granted subject to performance.\n\nThe recommendations for grants of shares subject to performance conditions are made by the management of each operating business and by the Group's functional department heads. These recommendations are reviewed by the Executive Management to ensure a global coherence and respect of the Group's internal equity principles. The amount and nature of individual share grants (in the form of Performance Shares or Restricted Shares) subject to performance conditions are then decided by the Board\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Furthermore, the grant to AXA executive o/ff icers shall depend on the level of achievement of the strategic objectives previously defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company, in line with market best practices, applies a regular and consistent formula to determine the number of shares to be granted each year to the beneficiaries.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the total number of performance shares granted to the Company's executive o/ff icers each year may not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares and Restricted Shares) granted during the same year, to avoid an excessive concentration of performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nSince 2020, the annual grant of shares subject to performance conditions occurs in March in order to simplify the structure of the senior executives' total variable compensation, so that they are granted (i) a variable compensation in the form of cash (annual bonus), and (ii) shares during the same month.\n\n## RULES REGARDING SHARES SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nEach beneficiary receives an initial preliminary allocation of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares or Restricted Shares) which is then used as a reference to calculate the number of shares that will be definitely granted at the end of a 3-year performance period.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDuring the performance period, all shares subject to performance conditions initially granted are integrally subject to performance criteria regardless of the beneficiary's status.\n\n## Performance Shares SNFP\n\nFor the Performance Shares granted in 2023, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, had reviewed the weight and the calibration of the Group financial relative performance (Total Shareholder Return) criterion and decided, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors, to increase the weight of this criterion from 10% to 20%, while maintaining a balance between financial and extra-financial criteria.\n\nFor the Performance Shares granted in 2023, the global performance rate will therefore be calculated as follows: 25% performance of the operating business (cash remittance) +25% performance of the operating business (underlying earnings) +10% sustainability strategy (S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment) (CSA) +10% sustainability strategy (operations carbon emission) +10% sustainability strategy (Inclusion and Diversity proportion of women within the Group's executive population (1) ) +20% Group financial relative performance (TSR), all capped at 130%.",

The total number of shares definitively acquired is capped at 130% of the initial grant.\n\nThe Performance Shares and International Performance Shares granted to the Management Committee members (except for the Chief Executive O/ff icer) will be acquired a/f\\_t er a three-year acquisition period, and 50% of the shares acquired will be subject to a further two-year holding period. The Performance Shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer will remain acquired at the end of a three-year acquisition period, with the entirety of the acquired shares restricted from sale during a two-year holding period.\n\nThe amounts corresponding to International Performance Shares and International Restricted Shares are operating expenses during the vesting period. They do not create any dilution for shareholders as no new shares are issued. The payment is made in shares. Should this type of payment not be possible for legal, tax or any other reason, the payment could be made in cash.\n\n## Restricted Shares\n\nSince 2022, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, may grant Restricted Shares to Group employees who are not senior managers. For Restricted Shares beneficiaries, the sole performance condition is the achievement of an average result of AXA's score in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (DJSI), calculated over the performance period, greater than or\n\nequal to the 75 th percentile. Should AXA's average score, calculated over the performance period, be equal to the 50 th percentile, only half of the shares initially granted would be acquired. Finally, should AXA's average score, calculated over the performance period, be lower than the 50 th percentile, no shares would be granted. This scheme does not guarantee a minimum gain to the beneficiaries. Among the di/ff erent performance levels, the number of shares definitively granted is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nFor Performance Shares and Restricted Shares, the achievement rate of the performance criterion (performance rate) is used to determine the number of AXA shares that will be definitively acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period, under the condition that the beneficiary is still employed by the AXA Group. The number of AXA shares definitively granted shall therefore be equal to the number of rights to AXA shares initially granted multiplied by the performance rate, which may not exceed 130% for the Performance Shares and 100% for the Restricted Shares. Furthermore, for the Performances Shares and Restricted Shares, should no dividend be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraints) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired would be automatically divided by two.\n\nI\n\nI",

The purpose of these grants was to associate them with AXA's share price performance and encourage their performance over the long term. In 2019, a/f\\_t er having progressively reduced the number of stock options beneficiaries over the past few years, AXA's Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, in order to simplify AXA's compensation policy and in line with market practice and feedback received from a number of institutional investors, decided to cease awarding stock options to corporate o/ff icers and AXA employees.\n\nPrevious plans are still valid until their expiration (maximum duration period of 10 years). They were granted at market value, with no discount, and become exercisable by tranches, generally in thirds between 3 and 5 years following the grant date.\n\nPursuant to the stock option plan rules, beneficiaries who resign from the Group lose the right to exercise their options.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, 133 AXA employees held a total of 5,148,652 outstanding options, representing 0.23% of the Company's share capital on the same date.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nAll options granted to all members of the Management Committee until 2018 were subject to a performance condition. This performance condition also applied to the last tranche of each option grant ( i.e., the last third of the options granted) for all other beneficiaries of options.\n\nPursuant to this performance condition, the options become fully exercisable only if the AXA share price outperformed the stock reference index of the insurance sector (1) . No option subject to such performance condition can be exercised as long as this criterion has not been reached. This external performance condition subjects the acquisition of the right to exercise the options to the achievement of a fully objective and public performance and allows the measure of the relative performance of AXA compared to its main European competitors over a period of at least three years.\n\nIf the performance condition has not been met at the expiry date of the options, these options are automatically cancelled.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors decided that a second performance condition would apply to all options granted in 2017 and 2018, pursuant to which beneficiaries would not be able to exercise their stock options in the event the net income of the Group is negative, and for as long as it remains so.\n\nI\n\nI",

This restriction applies from the date of grant until such time as the beneficiary receives the securities underlying the award upon, for example, the exercise of a stock option or the lapse of restrictions on shares subject to performance conditions. In accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the executive o/ff  icers of the Company make a formal commitment to not resort to such hedging transactions.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS HELD BY CORPORATE OFFICERS THAT BECAME EXERCISABLE DURING 2023\n\nNo options held by corporate officers became exercisable during 2023.\n\nOnly the last tranche of the last Stock Option plan granted in 2018 (representing one third of the total grant) remains subject to the performance condition. This condition has not been met over 2023 and the concerned options are therefore not exercisable.\n\nI\n\nI",

This policy requires each executive to hold, during the entire duration of his/her functions, a minimum number of AXA shares (the 'Minimum Shareholding Requirement') representing a multiple of the annual fixed compensation received for his/her functions within the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chief Executive O/ff icer is required to hold the equivalent of his annual fixed compensation multiplied by 3;\n- \u25a0 Management Committee members are required to hold the equivalent of their annual fixed compensation multiplied by 2;\n- \u25a0 Partners Group members are required to hold the equivalent of their annual fixed compensation multiplied by 1.\n\nAXA shares, ADS AXA or shares of listed Group subsidiaries, held directly or indirectly through Mutual funds or similar investment vehicles, regardless of their acquisition procedure, are taken into account for the purposes of calculating this Minimum Shareholding Requirement.\n\nEach concerned senior executive is required to meet this Minimum Shareholding Requirement within a period of 5 years as from the date of her/his first appointment.\n\nPursuant to articles L.22-10-59 II and L.22-10-57 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors has decided that, as long as the Chief Executive O/ff icer has not met his Minimum Shareholding Requirement, all Stock Options and Performance Shares granted to him will be subject to the following restrictions:\n\n- \u25a0 upon each exercise of these stock options granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must continue to hold in registered form a number of shares obtained upon exercise equal in value to at least 25% of the pre-tax capital gain realized upon exercise. These shares shall be held during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer; and\n- \u25a0 for Performance Shares granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must, at every Performance Share acquisition date, hold in registered form at least 25% of the Performance Shares acquired during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply if the Chief Executive O/ff icer complies with his Minimum Shareholding Requirement.\n\n## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nOn December 31, 2023, based on the AXA share value on that date (\u20ac29.49), the Chief Executive O/ff icer met his Minimum Shareholding Requirement as described in the above Section 'Share ownership policy for executives of the Group'.\n\n|               | Shareholding requirement   | Shareholding requirement   | Shareholding requirement   | Shareholding requirement   | Shareholding on 31/12/2023   | Shareholding on 31/12/2023   | Shareholding on 31/12/2023   | Shareholding on 31/12/2023   |\n|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|               | Fixed  compensation        | Number  of years           | Amount                     | Target date                | Number  of/uni202Fyears      | Amount                       | AXA  shares                  | AXA  Shareplan  units        |\n| Thomas Buberl | \u20ac1,650,000                 | 3                          | 4,950,000                  | 01/09/2021                 | 19.8                         | \u20ac32,724,763.31               | 1,108,732                    | 958                          |\n\n## MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\nOn December 31, 2023, based on the AXA share value on that date (\u20ac29.49), the members of the Management Committee held, on average, 2.8 times the equivalent of their fixed annual compensation.\n\nI\n\nI",

Mr. Thomas Buberl, as well as all other employees of AXA group entities in France, participate in a mandatory and collective supplementary pension scheme with defined contributions (collective insurance contract contrat d'assurance de Groupe as defined in article L.141-1 of the French Insurance Code). This AXA pension fund was implemented in 2011 and benefits to the employees of AXA group entities in France falling within the Scope of the Collective Agreement of December 18, 2009. The individual employer contribution rate is set at 0.75% of the total gross compensation, which is not capped. The contribution base is the same as the one used for contributions related to the Social Security General Scheme. Contributions are subject to 9.7% social charges (9.2% for CSG and 0.5% for CRDS).\n\n## Retirement performance shares\n\nSince December 2016, AXA has implemented a retirement performance shares plan which benefits all executive employees (directeurs) of AXA group entities in France including the Chief Executive O/ff icer, Mr. Thomas Buberl.\n\nIt provides beneficiaries with portable pension benefits until retirement in line with Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014, on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.\n\nThese performance shares are subject to (i) an acquisition period of three years, and (ii) an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may sell all or part of their shares for diversification purposes (following the three-year acquisition period), as long as the sale proceeds are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary's retirement.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe definitive acquisition of these performance shares is subject to (i) the beneficiary's presence in the AXA Group on December 31 of the year during which the grant is decided, and (ii) the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency II ratio calculated during the performance period.\n\nFor all beneficiaries, to benefit from the totality of performance shares initially granted, the average AXA Group Solvency II ratio calculated during the performance period must be greater than or equal to 170%. However, if the average ratio is 150%, only half of the shares initially granted will be acquired. No shares will be acquired if the average ratio is below 150%. No minimum number of shares is guaranteed.\n\nBetween these performance levels, the number of shares definitely acquired is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nIn the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired shall be automatically divided by two.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that no more than 10% of the total number of shares granted during any fiscal year should be granted to AXA's executive o/ff icers, to avoid an excessive concentration of retirement performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nOn December 6, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a grant of retirement performance shares. Accordingly, 608,728 retirement performance shares were granted to 489 o/ff icers, which represent 0.027% of the outstanding share capital on the date of the grant, of which 18,125 retirement performance shares were granted to AXA's Chief Executive O/ff icer representing 3.0% of the total grant.\n\nAll retirement performance shares granted are subject to the performance conditions described above and calculated over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025.",

In this context, the Board of Directors was concerned that the decision of Mr. Thomas Buberl to renounce his employment contract in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code would jeopardize the continuity of his accrued and future social benefits.\n\nAs a result, on August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors took the following decisions:\n\n- \u25a0 the Board of Directors authorized that, following the termination of his employment contract, Mr. Thomas Buberl would continue to have social benefits (Health insurance, Life insurance, Disability insurance, etc.) on terms equivalent to those of all other Group senior employees of the AXA Group in France;\n- \u25a0 the Board of Directors authorized a contractual severance benefit for Mr. Thomas Buberl designed to replicate the benefits to which he would have been entitled as AXA employee under the 1993 collective agreement covering director-level employees of the insurance sector, but with the addition of performance conditions in accordance with the Afep-Medef Code recommendations. A severance benefit would be applicable, except in the case of gross or willful misconduct, solely in the event of dismissal or non-renewal further to the Board of Directors' decision. The payment of the severance benefit would be subject to the three following performance conditions as determined by the Board of Directors during its\n\nAugust 2, 2016, meeting: (i) achievement, for at least 2 of the 3 preceding fiscal years, of the objectives set for the beneficiary's variable compensation and corresponding to the payment of at least 60% of his variable compensation target, (ii) evolution of the AXA share price at least equal to the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP) (in percentage) over a 3-year period preceding the termination of the term of o/ff ice, and (iii) the average consolidated adjusted ROE over the 3 preceding years higher than or equal to 5%.\n\nThe amount of severance benefit to be paid to the beneficiary would be adjusted in accordance with the level of achievement against these performance conditions: 100% of the severance benefit will be paid if at least two of the three performance conditions are met; 40% of the severance benefit will be paid if only one performance condition is met; and no severance benefit shall be paid if none of the performance conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if only two of the three performance conditions are met, the amount of severance benefit will be reduced by 50% if performance condition (i) above is not met or if AXA's consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year is negative.\n\nNo severance benefit will be paid if the beneficiary is entitled to a pension scheme within the 6 months following his termination.\n\nThe initial amount of the severance benefit is equal to 12 months of the average compensation (fixed and variable) paid during the 24-month period preceding termination. One month should then be added to the initial amount of the severance benefit for each additional year of future service up to a maximum cap of 24 months.\n\nThese commitments were approved by AXA's Shareholders' Meeting. They took e/ff ect upon Mr. Thomas Buberl's e/ff ective renunciation of his employment contract on September 1, 2016, and will continue as such for the duration of his mandate and under any potential renewed mandates.\n\nI\n\nI",

Following the 2023 Shareholders' Meeting and a/f\\_t er having analyzed investors' feedback as well as the results of the votes reflecting the large shareholders' support expressed, the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the overall compensation policy, which was considered appropriate, fair and balanced. As part of the continuous shareholder engagement approach, the Board of Directors will keep monitoring investors' and proxy advisors' expectations, along with market practices in the future.\n\nThe Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, the role and composition of which are presented in detail in Section 3.1 of this Annual Report, is notably responsible for formulating propositions to the Board of Directors regarding the Company's principles and policy on corporate o/ff icers' compensation.\n\nThe Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee is entirely composed of independent members, with the exception of the director representing the employees who sits on the Committee pursuant to the Afep-Medef recommendations. The Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee exchanges frequently with the Group's Management and some departments of the Company including Group H uman R esources, Group Legal and Group Sustainability. The Committee is also empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews by external experts when deemed appropriate. Such reviews allow the Committee to benefit from a technical expertise and independent insights in comparing AXA's compensation practices with general market practice.\n\n## COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n## Guiding principles of AXA's compensation policy\n\nAXA's compensation policy is designed to support the Company's Long-Term Business strategy and to align the interests of its management with those of its shareholders and all other stakeholders by (i) establishing a close relation between financial and extra-financial performance and compensation over the short, medium and long term, (ii) ensuring that the Group can o/ff er competitive compensation that is consistent with the various markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interests that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii) ensuring compliance of the Company's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nAXA's compensation policy notably aims to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract, develop and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n- \u25a0 drive superior performance; and\n- \u25a0 align compensation levels with the Company's results both on a financial and a sustainability level.\n\nThis compensation policy is based, in particular, on compensation practices for similar functions in AXA's main European and international competitors (insurance and reinsurance companies, banks) and other CAC 40 companies. The policy also complies with the remuneration recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the G20, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board.\n\n## Structure and criteria for determining the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation\n\nIn this context, the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on a pay-for-performance approach which (i) requires the achievement of challenging financial and operational targets that are defined and aligned with the Group's strategy, (ii) promotes long-term sustainable performance while incorporating risk adjustment measures in performance metrics, and (iii) determines the e/ff  ective amount of the actual individual compensation on the basis of both financial and extra-financial results.\n\nI\n\nI",

At that time, the Board of Directors also decided that, consistent with the Company's past practice, this new compensation package should remain unchanged for the duration of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's next term as a director ( i.e. , until 2026).\n\nTherefore, the Board decided to maintain for 2024 his compensation package and that no major change would be made to the compensation policy except the review of the objectives for 2024 notably in the context of the new Group Strategic Plan 2024-2026.\n\nThe di/ff erent components of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation are presented in detail herea/f\\_t er:\n\n## FIXED ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe determination of the amount of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's fixed compensation, in 2022, was notably based on an in-depth analysis of market practices carried out by an independent external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) as well as applicable national and international regulations. It also took into consideration various other factors such as experience, skills, as well as the criticality and scarcity of such skills, and the Group's fairness principles or the individual's compensation history.\n\nUpon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, the Board confirmed that the Chief Executive O/ff  icer's annual fixed compensation, set in 2022, at \u20ac1.65 million will be maintained for 2024.\n\n## VARIABLE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nWhen it determined the Chief Executive O/ff icer's target variable annual compensation, in 2022, following a comparative review of national, European, international and industry practices, the Board of Directors sought to establish a balanced structure between the fixed part and the variable part of his cash compensation.\n\nUpon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, the Board confirmed that the Chief Executive O/ff  icer's target variable annual compensation, set in 2022, at \u20ac1.75 million ( i.e. , 106% of the amount of his fixed annual compensation) will be maintained for 2024 and would continue to be subject in its entirety to challenging performance conditions and closely aligned with the Group's strategy.\n\nIt is specified that no minimum payment is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer and that his total e/ff ective variable compensation may not exceed 130% of his target variable compensation ( i.e. , 138% of his fixed annual compensation).\n\nThe evaluation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's annual performance with respect to the 2024 fiscal year will be based on the following two components, each of them capped at a 130% achievement rate:\n\n- \u25a0 T he Group's performance, evaluated on the basis of (i) underlying Earnings per share, (ii) cash remittance, (iii) the reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets, and (iv) the Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). The relative weight of each indicator will remain unchanged ( i.e. , 45%, 25%, 15% and 15% respectively). Each of the indicators will be capped at a 130% achievement rate.\n- The financial and extra-financial indicators chosen to measure the Group performance are directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. They reflect objectives for growth, capital management, sustainability and customer proximity and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target. Some of these indicators (underlying Earnings per share, cash remittance and the reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets) are identical to share-based compensation indicators in order to align part of the performance criteria of the short- and long-term compensation with the objectives of the strategic plan and to measure them on di/ff erent time scales through di/ff erent acquisition schedules. Nevertheless, the weight of common indicators in share-based compensation has decreased in 2024.\n- \u25a0 T he Individual performance, based on (i) various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board of Directors in a target letter drawn up at the beginning of the year, and (ii) demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/ff icer. The target letter includes detailed objectives related to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives assessing the achievement of global strategic initiatives or related to certain geographic areas, as well as progress on investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations;\n\nWith respect to the 2024 fiscal year, the Board of Directors, a/f\\_t er recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, set the five following objectives and their respective weights: (i) finalizing and launching AXA's new strategic plan for 202426 (the 'Plan') (15%), (ii) implementing the Plan and delivering 2024 Performance (40%), (iii) managing continued stability in the\n\nI\n\nI",

The rate of achievement of these di/ff erent objectives will be made public.\n\nEach of these two components will be evaluated separately so that the Chief Executive O/ff icer's overall variable pay-out reflects his performance against two distinct components assessed independently.\n\nWith respect to the 2024 fiscal year, the determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff  icer will continue to be based on the addition of two components: the Group performance for 70% and the individual performance for 30%.\n\nTo ensure that AXA remains aligned with current market practice and regulations within the financial industry, both in France and abroad, the Board of Directors decided to continue to use a deferral mechanism with respect to the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable annual compensation.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the payment of 30% of his actual variable annual compensation will be deferred over a three-year period paid out in three equal tranches and will remain subject to performance conditions. The deferred amount e/ff ectively paid out for each tranche will vary accordingly depending on the performance of the AXA share price over the deferral period within the limit of a cap at 130% of the deferred amount but without a floor. No deferred variable compensation would be paid (i) in the event that the Group's underlying earnings are negative for the year ending immediately prior to the year of the scheduled payout, or (ii) in case of resignation or dismissal, for gross or willful misconduct prior to the payout date.\n\nIn case of significant change a/ff ecting the calculation of the Group's economic parameters (significant transaction approved by the Board of Directors, change in accounting standards\u2026), the Board would be able to calculate the parameters mutatis mutandis , i.e. , without taking into account extraordinary external elements.\n\nThe Board of Directors also reserves the right to exercise its discretionary power regarding the determination of the Chief Executive O/ff  icer's compensation pursuant to legal provisions and in accordance with articles L.22-10-8 and L.22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, should any particular circumstance arise and justify an exceptional adjustment, either upwards (within the limit of 130% of the target variable compensation) or downwards to ensure that the application of the abovementioned criteria fairly reflect the Chief Executive O/ff icer's performance as well as that of the Group. Such adjustment would be decided by the Board of Directors, upon proposal from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee and would be made public.\n\nPayment of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable cash compensation for 2024 is subject to the approval by the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025 of the compensation elements paid during, or granted with respect to, the 2024 fiscal year to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION GRANTED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decides to grant Long-Term Incentives (LTI) to the Chief Executive O/ff icer in the form of performance shares.\n\nTo give the Chief Executive O/ff icer a stake in long-term value creation, these performance shares represent an important part of his compensation. However, the value of the performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer, as determined in accordance with the IFRS standards, may not in any event exceed half of his total compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the number of LTI granted to the Company's corporate o/ff icers, including the Chief Executive O/ff  icer, may not exceed 10% of the total number of LTI granted to all beneficiaries within the Group.\n\nThe performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer are entirely subject to demanding internal and external performance conditions (the details of which are presented in Section 3.2 of this Annual Report), which are assessed over a period of three years (followed by a two-year holding period), and do not guarantee a minimum grant or gain. Moreover, the performance shares plan rules provide that should the Chief Executive O/ff icer leave his position (1) at any time before the end of the performance period, any performance shares initially granted with respect to such period would be irremediably lost, unless otherwise decided by the Board of Directors in a decision publicly disclosed at the time of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's departure (in such case, all or part of the performance shares could be maintained, and the vesting calendar and performance conditions attached to the performance shares set at the grant date would remain unchanged).\n\nIn order to align the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation more directly with the Group's long-term performance and the interests of shareholders, the Board of Directors, upon proposal from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, has decided in 2022 that the total value of the performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2023, shall not exceed 180%\n\nI\n\nI",

Through this change, the Board of Directors sought to (i) give significant importance to the Chief Executive O/ff icer' share-based compensation, which will represent almost 50% of his total compensation, and\n\n- (ii) strengthen the 'at-risk' portion of his total compensation (variable cash compensation and share-based compensation) so that it\n\nrepresents the vast majority (approximately 75%) of his total compensation. The Board has decided to maintain this principle for 2024.\n\nPursuant to article L.22-10-57 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors has decided to maintain for 2024 the principles according to which, as long as the Chief Executive O/ff icer has not met his Minimum Shareholding Requirement ( i.e. , holding a number of shares representing his annual fixed compensation multiplied by three), all stock options and performance shares granted to him will be subject to the following restrictions:\n\n- \u25a0 upon each exercise of these stock options granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must continue to hold in registered form a number of shares obtained upon exercise equal in value to at least 25% of the pre-tax capital gain realized upon exercise. These shares shall be held during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer;\n- \u25a0 for performance shares granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must, at every performance share acquisition date, hold in registered form at least 25% of the performance shares acquired during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply if the Chief Executive O/ff icer complies with his Minimum Shareholding Requirement.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\n## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S DIRECTORS' FEES\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is not entitled to payment of any directors' fees from the Company.\n\n## BENEFITS IN KIND GRANTED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe only benefit in kind granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is the use of a company car.\n\n## ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION RELATING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S RETIREMENT\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer does not participate in any pension schemes with defined benefits.\n\nAs all other executives of AXA group entities in France, he participates in the retirement performance share plan, under which grants are made on an annual basis.\n\nThe retirement performance shares granted under such plans are subject to (i) an acquisition period of three years, and (ii) an undertaking not to sell the retirement performance shares before the date on which the beneficiary retires, subject to the option o/ff ered to the beneficiaries, for diversification purposes, to sell their shares (a/f\\_t er the end of the acquisition period of three years) as long as the proceeds of such sale are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary retires.\n\nThe acquisition of the retirement performance shares is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition (the details of which are set out in Section 3.2 of this Annual Report), linked to the average AXA Group Solvency II ratio calculated over the performance period. No minimum grant or gain is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer under this scheme.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, decided that the total value of the retirement performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2024 shall not exceed 15% of his fixed and cash variable annual compensation.\n\nAs all other employees of AXA group entities in France, the Chief Executive O/ff icer of the Company participates in a mandatory and collective supplementary pension scheme with defined contributions (collective insurance contract contrat d'assurance de groupe as defined in article L.141-1 of the French Insurance Code) as further described in Section 3.2 paragraph 'Termination provisions' of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATED COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe commitments made to the benefit of the Chief Executive O/ff icer regarding social benefits, approved in 2016, are described in Section 3.2 paragraph 'Termination provisions' of this Annual Report.\n\n## COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UPON TERMINATION OF OFFICE\n\nThe commitments made to the Chief Executive O/ff icer upon termination of o/ff ice, approved in 2016, are described in Section 3.2 paragraph 'Termination provisions' of this Annual Report.\n\n## OTHER ELEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer does not benefit from any non-compete indemnity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This role is presented in detail in the Board's Terms of Reference as well as in Section 3.1 of this Annual Report and goes beyond the statutory duties of a chairman of board of directors under French law.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors decided, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, to maintain the amount of the fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors unchanged, for 2024, i.e. , at \u20ac925,000.\n\nHaving considered that the most appropriate compensation structure for the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be a fixed compensation only, the Board of Directors has resolved, consequently, that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not benefit from any variable compensation, any compensation provided for in article L.22-10-14 of the French Commercial Code (directors' fees), any performance share grants, any other long-term compensation element, or any benefit in kind.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nFinally, there is no employment contract between the Company and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and the Chairman is not entitled to any severance benefits, any allowance relating to any non-compete clause in the event that he ceases to be Chairman of the Board of Directors, or any pension scheme.\n\n## REGULATED COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThere is no regulated commitment made to the benefit of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nI\n\nI",

In particular, the Board considered that this role does not prevent Mrs. Angelien Kemna from exercising her mandate as a director of AXA with complete independence considering (i) AXA IM is an unlisted 97% owned subsidiary of the Group, and (ii) any potential conflicts that may arise are manageable by Mrs. Angelien Kemna abstaining from any debate and/or vote on the matter in question, in line with the Board's Terms of Reference.

The assessment procedure has been implemented within AXA since that date.\n\nThis procedure, which is reviewed by the Board of Directors annually, provides for the Group Legal Department to be informed prior to the conclusion, amendment, renewal, extension, or\n\ntermination of any agreement falling within the Scope of article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code, regardless of the ordinary nature of the transaction or the arm's length basis of the agreement. This information enables the Group Legal Department to carry out a prior review of the agreement in order to determine whether it should be subject to the 'regulated' agreements procedure provided for under articles L.225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code or whether it is exempted from such procedure. To this end, the Group Legal Department may seek the advice of the AXA Group's other relevant departments and of the Company's Statutory Auditors.\n\nIn addition, the Group Legal Department annually assesses whether ordinary agreements concluded at arm's length terms and conditions continue to meet the conditions for such qualification, in cooperation with the AXA Group's relevant departments and the Company's Statutory Auditors where necessary. If the Group Legal Department considers that an agreement initially qualified as ordinary and concluded at arm's length terms and conditions constitutes a 'regulated' agreement, the Board of Directors decides on the qualification of the said agreement and on the actions to be taken on it according to the qualification adopted.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This statement includes the AXA Group's business model and information on its principal extra-financial risks ('sustainability risks') related to environmental, employer responsibility, society, human rights, and tax development strategy implemented by the AXA Group. For more information on the risks to which the Group is exposed, please refer to Section 5.1 'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nFurther detailed information on the AXA Group's sustainability policies and practices is also available in the 'Integrated Report', AXA SA's annual 'Climate & Biodiversity Report', the online 'Group Human Capital Report' (3) and on the AXA Group's website (www. axa.com), in the section entitled 'Commitments'.\n\nIn this Section 4 of the Annual Report, unless provided otherwise, 'ESG' and 'sustainability', as used in the context of describing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\ncriteria, risks, or objectives, refer to Environmental, Social and Governance matters.\n\nSustainability is also an increasingly regulated area: AXA Group is currently working on the implementation of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 14, 2022, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (the ' CSRD '), which is applicable to financial years starting on or a/f\\_t  er January 1, 2024. It requires AXA Group to disclose for the first time in 2025, with respect to the financial year ending on December 31, 2024, the impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to Environmental, Social and Governance sustainability matters that are material to the Group's activities and operations. Thus, AXA Group is in the process of carrying out a double-materiality assessment of the risks and opportunities ( i.e. , outside-in perspective) and its positive and negative impacts ( i.e. , insideout perspective) based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (the 'ESRS' (4) ).\n\nThe results of this assessment will be disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report (for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024) to be published in compliance with the CSRD.\n\n## AXA Group's purpose entails sustainable value creation\n\nSustainability is considered both as a risk and an opportunity for AXA Group: it allows AXA Group to take steps to reduce social and environmental risks, while at the same time, opening market opportunities in emerging business segments and helping drive innovation.\n\nAXA Group's purpose 'Act for human progress by protecting what matters' , which was announced in June 2020, highlights the creation of sustainable value for the environment and for\n\nsociety thanks to several factors: the Group's ability to invest in the global economy and to provide protection services to individual and corporate customers, its expertise in improving resilience against risks, but also the responsible management of its di/ff  erent stakeholders' interests. By leveraging its understanding of risks to help better protect the basic needs of individuals and communities (environmental protection, access to healthcare, prosperity, and quality of life), AXA Group's goal is to enable these individuals and communities to progress.\n\nI\n\nI",

Recognizing the fundamental importance of ESG for the Group's business and its customers, the Management Committee dedicated for the first time a pillar of the strategic plan to the Group's ESG ambition: 'Sustain our Climate leadership position' - please refer to Section 'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report'.\n\nThe Group's sustainability strategy aimed to fulfill two main goals: to act against climate change and to develop health and protection activities as an inclusive insurer.\n\nOn February 22, 2024, AXA Group presented the main priorities of its new strategic plan 'Unlock the Future' (1) , which integrated climate and inclusion challenges. In line with its purpose, AXA remains firmly committed to help building a resilient society by putting at the core of its strategy financial inclusion and climate transition. As an integral part of the strategic plan, AXA Group will expand on the next chapter of its sustainability strategy in the second quarter of 2024 .\n\n## 'AXA FOR PROGRESS INDEX': MEASURING THE IMPACT OF OUR PURPOSE\n\nAXA Group has implemented a set of strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure and track its progress: the 'AXA for Progress Index'. Launched in April 2021 during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the ' AXA for Progress Index ' is a set of seven commitments, translated into targets and shared across the Group to further embed sustainable development in its activities: as an investor, as an insurer and as an exemplary company. In 2022, AXA Group announced its targets for the insurance pillar of the 'AXA for Progress Index' (please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss' and Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer'). In 2023, the Group focused its e/ff orts on delivering on the current 'AXA for Progress Index' and designing the next edition of its strategic KPIs.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

In this context, the Board of Directors decided to update the Board's Terms of Reference, rename the 'Compensation & Governance Committee' the 'Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee' in order to emphasize its leading role on sustainability matters, and specify each Committee's duties in respect of these matters.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n- \u25a0 the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee reviews, at least once a year, the Group's sustainability strategy as well as material sustainability-related commitments disclosed publicly and reports to the Board of Directors in this regard;\n- \u25a0 the Audit Committee monitors the process for the preparation and control of the Group's extra-financial information, reviews the Group's extra-financial performance statement and the Climate & Biodiversity Report and considers and makes a recommendation to the Board regarding the appointment, reappointment, dismissal or resignation of the auditor(s) in charge of certifying sustainability-related information; and\n- \u25a0 the Finance & Risk Committee reviews the Group's risk appetite framework for extra-financial exposures as well as its responsible investment policy.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's sustainability strategy (including its climate strategy and the measures, action plans and timeframes to implement such strategy) was reviewed and discussed during several meetings of the Board and the Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee before being formally approved by the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee.\n\nFor further information on the AXA Group's governance on sustainability matters, please refer to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee Terms of Reference, which are available\n\nI\n\nI\n\non the AXA Group's website (https://www.axa.com/en/aboutus/board-of-directors and https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/ audit-committee), as well as Section 3.1 'corporate governance structure' of this Annual Report.\n\n## AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL\n\nAt the executive level, the Management Committee oversees material sustainability-related initiatives across the Group.\n\nThe Management Committee is supported by the 'Role in Society Steering Committee' (RISSC) . The RISSC is charged with developing and overseeing the operational implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy and reviewing material sustainability-related issues faced by the Group as well as monitoring material sustainability-related initiatives across the Group. The RISSC meets monthly and is co-chaired by the Group Chief Underwriting O/ff icer, Group Chief Investment O/ff icer, and Group Chief Communication, Brand and Sustainability O/ff icer. The RISSC reports back to the Group Management Committee on a regular basis concerning material sustainability-related decisions taken or to be taken and issues considered in respect of which Management Committee guidance and/or decisions are needed.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Risk and Compliance Committee (ARCC) is charged with reviewing all material audit, risk (including sustainability-related risks) and compliance issues faced by the Group. The ARCC also reviews mandatory sustainability reporting (including this Chapter 4). The ARCC meets monthly and is chaired by the Group General Counsel, and reports back to the Group Management Committee on a regular basis on such topics. For more information, please refer to Section 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe RISSC and the ARCC report regularly to the Board on material topics of this nature.\n\nThe RISSC is supported by the 'Responsible Investment Committee' (RIC) and the ' Group Underwriting Committee ' (GUC) in respect of the Group's sustainable investment and sustainable underwriting strategies respectively. For more information, please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, the Group's sustainability strategy and sustainabilityrelated initiatives are presented at least once a year to the Group's social partners.\n\nAcross the local entities, a network of sustainability executives oversees the implementation of the sustainability strategy and promotes best practices.",

At the 2023 annual Shareholders' Meeting, AXA Group held a roundtable discussion with four members of the Group's Management Committee on climate issues, the sharing of value created by the Company and investment in the real economy, enabling the Group to explain the main actions and commitments in these areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nIn addition, AXA Group participates in more than 50 coalitions, working groups and pledges, gathering both NGOs and public authorities, around climate change and biodiversity loss, as well as inclusion themes (please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss' and Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report). External stakeholders are also regularly invited to dialogue sessions with the members of the di/ff erent governance bodies described above. These numerous exchanges enable the Group to integrate major and emerging issues into its strategy.\n\n## Sustainability risk assessment\n\nAXA Group has conducted an internal risk assessment to identify its main sustainability risks, in accordance with the NFRD .\n\nFurthermore, in connection with the future application of the CSRD mentioned above, AXA Group is in the process of carrying out a double-materiality assessment of the financial risks and opportunities ( i.e. , outside-in perspective) and its positive and negative impacts ( i.e. , inside-out perspective) based on the ESRS for each of the sustainability topics assessed.\n\nFor further information about the CSRD, please refer to Section 7.3 'General information - Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives' of this Annual Report.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY\n\nThe sustainability risk assessment is updated every year.\n\nFor the purpose of the sustainability risk assessment performed in 2023, the approach was led by the Group sustainability team and supported by other relevant departments in order to identify non-financial ESG risks and assess their materiality.\n\nFirst, risk factors for each area related to sustainability (governance, responsible employer, climate change and biodiversity loss, inclusive insurer and business behavior) are identified, based on sustainability risks studied in prior years and the 2023 Future Risks Report, which outlines major trends on the risk landscape for society at large.\n\nSecond, those risks are cross-referenced with the AXA Group Operational Risk Profile (for more information please refer to Section 5.7 'Operational risks') and compared against the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (the 'S&P CSA').\n\nThe S&P CSA provides scores, which are among the key factors considered for determining eligibility of companies for potential inclusion in the ESG Indices. It applies a best-in-class approach for each of the 62 industries that are covered through detailed assessments that contain a mix of cross-industry and industryspecific questions.\n\nFollowing this comparison, these risks are internally assessed by an expert panel, identified based on their knowledge of specific sustainability risks. The assessment is conducted, using the AXA Group Operational Risks guidelines, to analyze and rate the risks based on three criteria: severity, frequency and impact on interests and expectations of stakeholders. Each expert is asked to rate the risk(s) related to his or her expertise.\n\nA/f\\_t er the risks are assessed by the expert panel, cross-sectoral experts, identified based on their transversal knowledge of the extra-financial risk universe, are utilized to assess the relevance of those ratings during the first stage. In that aim, they are asked to rate all the risks, using the same three criteria (severity, frequency and impact on interests and expectations of stakeholders) and the same scales.\n\nDuring these two steps, the experts are able to take into account the interests and expectations of our stakeholders thanks to regular dialogue between them, notably through the more than 50 coalitions, working groups and pledges gathering both NGOs and public authorities, as described in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy - Sustainability governance and Stakeholder dialogue'. In addition, some experts are in regular contact with investors, journalists and extra-financial ratings agencies.\n\nFollowing these two steps, a rating is calculated representing, for each risk, the overall materiality (considering the ratings on severity and frequency) and the overall impact on interests and expectations of stakeholders.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

To learn about the experiences of its employees and constantly improve, AXA conducts a voluntary and anonymous survey called the Inclusion Survey each year. The third Inclusion Survey ran in 2023 across 51 countries with a strong and steady participation rate similar to the last 2 years (a 58% participant rate for 2023).\n\nWhile the survey was adapted to respect nuances of local culture, each version contributed to AXA's overall inclusion Net Promoter Score ('iNPS') (1) . That score increased by 7 points (from 40 in 2022 to 47 in 2023), and there was also an improvement in all other scores compared to 2022: 88% of respondents felt they belonged and were included at AXA (+2 pts) and 75% felt they had equal opportunities (+4 pts).\n\n## 'WE CARE' PROGRAM\n\nIn 2023, AXA went one step further in its global health and wellbeing policy for its employees by announcing the launch of its ' We Care ' program, designed to support AXA's workforce at di/ff erent life stages and during moments that matter. The program aims to provide AXA's employees with the time, support, and resources to make personal and professional decisions with confidence. The new program reflects an important evolution in the existing o/ff ering and enables AXA to progress further on its long-term commitment towards an inclusive and supportive global workplace culture.\n\n' We Care ' program will be deployed across all AXA entities by the end of 2024 (2) through four main pillars:\n\n- 1. caregiver policy;\n- 2. parent policy;\n- 3. domestic and sexual violence policy;\n- 4. and the ' Healthy You ' program.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Ca regiver  policy\n\nA new policy was introduced to provide employees caring for immediate family members who require eldercare or care due to a serious health condition and/or disability with up to five days of fully paid leave.\n\n## Pa rent  policy\n\nAlongside the existing 16 weeks fully paid parent leave for the primary parent, the ' We Care '  program will also double the length of fully paid co-parent leave from 4 weeks to 8 weeks. Additional leave and flexible working arrangements will be o/ff ered to support employees receiving and recovering from in-vitro fertilization, or in the case of pregnancy loss.\n\n## Do mestic and sexual violence policy\n\nSince 2015, AXA has been combating domestic, intra-family and sexual violence through the Elle's Angels program established by AXA France and AXA Hearts in Action. This unique model, structured around a team of volunteer lawyers and an endowment fund, o/ff  ers legal and financial support to women victims of violence. 1,700 persons have been supported since the program's inception, including customers, victims taken in by partner associations, and - since 2021 - AXA employees in France.\n\nActions to support employees impacted by domestic, intra-familial and sexual violence have also been taken in AXA Sigorta, AXA Spain, and AXA UK - and AXA will now expand their commitment to this topic at Global level. All entities will, by the end of 2024, roll out a program of support for all impacted employees by providing access to psychological support, specialist support services, flexible working arrangements, and five days of fully paid leave.

It covers the following services (the list is not exhaustive):\n\n- \u25a0 an in-person medical check-up for all employees over 40 years old every four years and a digital medical check-up for all employees every two years;\n- \u25a0 on-site health-related prevention and awareness days;\n- \u25a0 an annual flu vaccination campaign;\n- \u25a0 an Employee Assistance Program with 24-hour mental health and psychological support;\n- \u25a0 medical teleconsultation services;\n- \u25a0 digital programs focusing on prevention, and raising awareness on topics related to health and wellbeing;\n- \u25a0 a second medical opinion service for employees with a critical illness; and\n- \u25a0 financial support (covering at least 75% of medical expenses) as well as mental health support for employees with cancer.\n\nA s part of the broader ' We Care ' program, 'Healthy You' program will expand in 2024 to provide a supportive working environment for employees experiencing menstrual health conditions, menopause or andropause.\n\nIn 2023, a second digital medical check-up campaign took place with the participation of more than 39,000 employees, reflecting three main global health risk factors: cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and nutrition. On top of the digital medical check-up, 26,000 employees have benefited from the in-person medical check-up.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n2023's Global Health Days focused on physical activity, nutrition, and mental health. Local entities made the days their own, with AXA buildings hosting physical trainers and other well-being and health prevention activities. Educational resources were also made available to all AXA employees with a video series explaining h ow and why to adopt a healthy lifestyle . And podcasts, featuring internal and external experts exploring 'Mind Health Matters' from the perspective of an individual, a family, a workplace and the society as a whole, were published on internal and external platforms. The topic of cognitive health was revisited in a Grouplevel conference titled Caring for your Aging Parents where speakers taught an online audience of thousands how to support relatives and caregivers and to protect their own mental health.\n\nThe AXA Group pays particular attention to providing access to information regarding the benefits, services and entitlements proposed to employees in the various entities.\n\n## PROGRESSING TOWARDS GENDER BALANCE\n\nT he Group continues to progress towards gender parity at all levels of the organization with a strong focus from managers and leaders across the entire Group. This is illustrated by AXA Group's commitment to reaching gender parity amongst the Global Leadership Network ('GLN', see the definition in the footnote (c) of the table below), which has led to measurable progress. For example, the proportion of women in top executive positions is currently at 40%, up 1 point from 2022 and up 10 points from March 2019. In addition, significant progress has been made in the Partners Group: the proportion of women is up from 24% in 2022 to 48% at the end of 2023.\n\n|       | Management Committee  (a)   | Management Committee  (a)   | Management Committee  (a)   | Partners Group  (b)   | Partners Group  (b)   | Partners Group  (b)   | Global Leadership Network  (c)   | Global Leadership Network  (c)   | Global Leadership Network  (c)   |\n|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|       | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2021                        | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2023                             | 2022                             | 2021                             |\n| Women | 38%                         | 20%                         | 21%                         | 48%                   | 24%                   | 27%                   | 40%                              | 39%                              | 36%                              |\n| Men   | 62%                         | 80%                         | 79%                         | 52%                   | 76%                   | 73%                   | 60%                              | 61%                              | 64%                              |\n| TOTAL | 16                          | 15                          | 14                          | 42                    | 41                    | 45                    | 253                              | 237                              | 243                              |\n\n- (b)  The Partners group is composed of the members of the Management Committee and over thirty other senior executives from across the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Steps have been taken to close unjustified pay gaps and give women equal access to mentors, development opportunities, job roles, and promotions. Since 2012, AXA has run yearly programmes across its entities to support women's careers. AXA Evolve has helped talented individuals - the majority of them women - reach GLN-level roles. The program provides 12 months of assessments, sponsorship, development, and feedback. 23 executives participated in the program in 2023, 52% of them women. Alongside this, members of the Management Committee and Partners took part in the Thrive initiative for a second year running, mentoring 40 of AXA's talented women. Thrive is organized to coincide with International Women's Day and this year it was expanded to include members of the GLN, creating a further 101 mentoring opportunities alongside entity mentoring actions. Such e/ff orts embody AXA's purpose and culture as an inclusive employer.\n\nAnnually, AXA monitors its unadjusted pay gap which mainly reflects gender balance within organizational structures. An unadjusted pay gap is a broad measure of the di/ff erence between the average pay of all women in the organization and the average pay of all men in the same organization, regardless of their role, seniority, level, or location. In 2022, the average global gender pay gap was assessed at 26% on fixed remuneration and at 32% on total compensation.\n\nMoreover, AXA's Group Management Committee and Chief Executive O/ff  icers gave specific attention to internal coherence and external market compensation positioning in the past years, which resulted in closing the average compensation gaps towards market positioning between women and men in the GLN population.\n\n## CLOSING PAY GAPS\n\nAXA also monitors its adjusted pay gap which compares the average pay of the women with that of the men a/f\\_t er accounting for a selected set of professional characteristics. Because it considers characteristics like job families, locations and grades, the adjusted pay gap is a finer calculation than the unadjusted pay gap. A residual gap may still be justifiable based on relevant professional characteristics - other than job families, locations and grades - at AXA, the global residual adjusted pay gap is currently assessed at 2%, below the EU Pay Transparency Directive (1) .\n\nThe residual adjusted pay gaps that are not justified through relevant professional reasons are unjustified. The Group made significant progress in closing unjustified pay gaps to ensure pay is consistent and free from discrimination, that is, not relating to personal factors such as age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, marital status, or disability. Entities annually monitor and address unjustified pay gaps with dedicated budgets to close any remaining unjustified equal pay gaps.\n\nSince 2022, AXA has been applying a new equal pay methodology applicable to all entities through a regression analysis to ensure a consistent and robust approach to equal pay assessments, while also anticipating regulatory developments (including the EU Pay Transparency Directive). Group standards and processes across entities (relating to recruitment, compensation reviews, and promotions) have also been strengthened to ensure gaps do not arise or reappear in the future as detailed in this chapter - Section 4.2 'Employer Responsibility'.\n\nReporting on ethnicity (especially ethnicity pay gaps) has been harder to address across locations - mainly because of local regulations. Only one entity was able to request data on ethnicity and had the opportunity to gain some insight on ethnicity-related issues.\n\n## INCLUSIVE  RECRUITMENT\n\nBuilding a diverse organization begins with recruitment. In 2023, the recruitment process was scrutinized to ensure people feel welcomed and fairly treated at every stage of their relationship with AXA. The result was the AXA Inclusive Recruitment Guide which was published in multiple languages. Teams working in Talent Acquisition, as well as in Inclusion and Diversity, have been trained in best practices - planning interviews around candidate accessibility requirements, for example, and placing job adverts where they are likely to be seen by underrepresented groups.\n\nAt the same time, several measures were introduced across the Group, such as asking candidates on recruitment platforms whether they had adequate support during the recruitment process and introducing a pathway for candidates to report any concerns they had.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## REINFORCING AXA'S FAIR PAY ACTION\n\nAXA has reinforced its Fair Pay approach by considering that employees' pay should not only be fair and competitive, but also at a level determined su/ff icient for the location they work in. A living wage goes beyond any current statutory minimum wages (although some countries like Ireland have commenced the process to transpose living wages into their domestic law). The living wage is more comprehensive and is defined as the wage needed for employees and their families to cover basic needs including decent housing, food, and access to healthcare and education (depending on their working location).\n\nAXA contracted the Fair Wage Network to conduct an analysis in all the Group's countries of operation to assess employees' pay against local living wages, following which AXA Group has been certified as a Global Living Wage employer. To build onto AXA's journey towards Pay Transparency that will be pursued over the next strategic plan, AXA has made a new commitment to o/ff er all employees a total cash remuneration of at least 110% of local living wage by the end of 2026.\n\nThis complements AXA's Fair Pay Framework that includes the newly launched ' We Care ' program (detailed above) next to other forms of remuneration and local benefit o/ff erings. Such recognition enables AXA to progress on its long-term commitment towards an inclusive and supportive workplace culture around the globe.\n\n## MULTI-GENERATION ACTION PLAN\n\nAXA takes action to support and value all generations, while combatting age-related stereotypes. In recent years, a number of initiatives have attracted young people with diverse backgrounds to AXA, and many more activities aimed at enhancing the working experience for employees over the age of 50.\n\nAt AXA France, a communications campaign launched this year to enhance the status of employees over 50 in the company. Called L'audace n'a pas d'\u00e2ge ('Daring is ageless'), the campaign was aimed internally at combating age-related stereotypes. Externally, it resulted in the release of a series of eight podcasts featuring French celebrities who entered a new career trajectory around the age of 50, with the aim of inspiring and raising awareness among listeners. At the same time, AXA France has set up an HR process dedicated to this target group of employees with tailor-made interviews and collective development workshops.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nTo mention other entities' practices: AXA Switzerland held conferences to help employees prepare for retirement, and in AXA Japan, older employees can ask for flexible working arrangements like transitioning to a part-time role.\n\nAXA is interested in opening exchanges between generations, so it can continue to be a harmonious workplace for people in diverse age groups. Alongside local measures, AXA Group will implement an action plan to support employees over 50 from January 2024. The action plan will include a global awareness campaign, similar to the one launched in 2023 by AXA France, and will include opportunities for training and development for employees over the age of 50 and for recruiters to ensure everyone has equal opportunities to succeed no matter their age.\n\n## DISABILITY INCLUSION\n\nA XA was one of the first signatories of The Valuable 500 - a global collective made up of 500 CEOs and their companies, innovating together for disability inclusion. In 2022, AXA announced its intention to join their new program, Generation Valuable. The program pairs a Group-level executive with a rising leader who has a connection to disability, for the purpose of making progress on disability inclusion.\n\nDuring 2023, 13 pairs took part in a global mentorship program called Exchange and focused on local disability priorities, which ranged from digital accessibility to the creation of employee resource groups and education programs. Coming together at the AXA Disability Inclusion Forum in Paris allowed for the transference of learning across the Group, as well as raised awareness of other businesses acting for people with disabilities. Leaders from AXA, the Valuable 500, L'Or\u00e9al Group and Sanofi shared their perspectives.\n\nUnder the sponsorship of AXA's Deputy CEO and the General Counsel for AXA UK and Ireland, entities will take further actions on disability inclusion - adopting practices and reporting against four measures:\n\n- 1. entity-level executive sponsorship for disability;\n- 2. annualised plans;\n- 3. centralized budgets for workplace accommodations;\n- 4. policies for workplace accommodations.\n\nThis approach should create a consistent and comparable baseline from which to track progress on disability inclusion. A playbook and information hub were made to support entities on their journeys.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

The Group has reinforced ESG's place within its culture and values through short-term and long-term incentives (please refer to Section 3.2 'Executive compensation and share ownership' of this Annual Report for further details):\n\n- \u25a0 the GLN are assessed on qualitative climate and diversity objectives, which are included in their annual target letters;\n- \u25a0 a quantitative climate objective is included in the AXA Group performance grid, impacting around 2,000 employees' variable remuneration pay out; and\n- \u25a0 long-term incentives include ESG criteria (climate and diversity objectives in Performance Shares plan, AXA ranking in the S&P Global CSA - Corporate Sustainability Assessment- in both Performance Shares and Restricted Shares plans), covering a population of around 6,000 employees every year.\n\nIt is also AXA's ambition to increase the weight of sustainability criteria in profit sharing agreements to 30% (prevalent in certain European countries, impacting over 20,000 employees every year) which also ensures employees are empowered to personally take inclusive and tangible actions.\n\nIn 2023, around 65% of France-based AXA entities had profitsharing schemes with at least 20% of their performance conditions being related to ESG. AXA XL has taken the challenge a step further by targeting 40% of performance conditions in their profit-sharing agreement, including a specific criterion for employees' training on climate.\n\n## I AXA employees: empowere d to deliver their best\n\n## GLOBAL PULSE SURVEYS\n\nAX A's Global Pulse Surveys are important tools to check how AXA Group employees feel about AXA - both its business and its culture. For example, the survey measures how confident they are in AXA's strategic direction, and how connected they feel to their teams. The surveys are held biannually and ran in June and November 2023.\n\nThe survey reached its highest participation rate to date in November 2023: 82% ( versus 80% in 2022). The level of employee engagement also set records for the Group. At +40 eNPS (+3 pts since June 2023), it is the highest score AXA has ever achieved.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY FIGURES: EMPLOYEE NET PROMOTER SCORES\n\n|                   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| eNPS  (a)  target | 38     | 36     | 37     | 25     | 14     |\n| eNPS  (a)  result | 40     | 35     | 36     | 35     | 21     |\n| EMPLOYEE COVERAGE | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 90%    |\n\n- (a)  The employee Net Promoter Score is measured by asking employees one question: 'How likely are you to recommend AXA as a place to work?'. The answer scale is from 0 to 10, and the result is calculated by taking the percent of promoters (answers of 9-10) and subtracting the percent of detractors (answers of 0 - 5). This then produces a metric on a scale from (-100) to (+100).\n\n## SOCIAL  DIALOGUE\n\nAXA has always considered social dialogue at local and global level as essential to its culture. At a Group level, the European Works Council ('EWC') serves as a crucial forum. It meets twice a year in plenary sessions chaired by the Group CEO, and seven\n\nI\n\nI\n\ntimes in bureau sessions, which are more restricted. Together, members of the Committee are representing the employees' point of view in the di/ff erent discussions.\n\nThe EWC offers several benefits. It provides a platform for stakeholders with diverse perspectives. Collectively, they can review decisions with the knowledge of working in many regions",

        "page_content": "and markets. There is always a fruitful exchange of ideas, which ultimately helps make AXA more agile, as it adopts tactics and strategies from around the world.\n\nIn 2023, the EWC signed a Charter on age inclusion, inspired by the Club Landoy Charter and the initiatives implemented at AXA France. It binds the whole Group to enhancing the role of employees over the age of 50 in the Company from January 1, 2024. Therefore, the EWC is a valuable asset for AXA as it represents its employees.\n\n## 'SMART WORKING'\n\nIn 2020 AXA rolled out a Global Smart Working policy to all employees based on 2-3 days a week in the o/ff ice, with local adaptations according to local market specifics. By dividing their time between remote working and o/ff ice hours, employees are empowered to take advantage of each working style, while maintaining service to the customer and connection to their team. Though AXA and its employees have embraced the flexibility that comes with remote work, spending time together in person is an anchor of AXA's culture. For AXA, the o/ff ice remains a crucial place to collaborate, socialize, share ideas, and feel part of a wider organization.\n\nTo support teams in discussing and agreeing how to work most e/ff  ectively as a hybrid team, Team Agreements are an important tool used across all of AXA. It is a written document that sets out how teams agree to work together - formed through regular, collaborative discussion. When asked about 'Smart Working' in the 2023 June Global Pulse survey, 81% of all employees said they have a team agreement in place, and 86% said they felt connected to their teams.\n\n## LEADERSHIP  CAPABILITIES\n\nIn a hybrid organization, leadership is as important as ever. 'Lead the Way' is the flagship learning journey for the GLN - the organization's top 250 executives. Since its launch in 2022, 16 cohorts have experienced AXA's executive development program, representing 90% of the GLN. During the sessions, participants were joined by members of the Management Committee - who shared their vision and experience in fireside chats - and partners - who acted as coaches - in France's Rambouillet National Forest. The o/ff -site brought AXA's leadership model to life, and individuals had the option of continuing their learning through coaching and check-ins.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.2 EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe success of 'Lead the Way' was evidenced by the GLN's desire to share learning with their colleagues and entities. That feedback inspired the design of 'Lead Together', a collective o/ff site session with the full executive team of the Entity which aims at fostering collaboration between leaders and functions at an entity-level. Seven leadership teams went through 'Lead Together' in 2023, including senior leaders from AXA Spain who attended the pilot. The Spanish team were highly involved in the initial design of several activities that have since been developed into a deployment toolbox.\n\n## LEADERSHIP  MODEL\n\nThe leadership model was initially developed for the GLN, but the model has proven so beneficial that it will be shared with the Group's whole community of people managers. In 2024, 10,000 managers will receive information and training explaining the model. They will learn about four pillars of behaviors: energize, navigate, dare and deliver. 'Care' is also at the heart of the model. AXA's leaders should exhibit care for customers, for employees, for shareholders, and for society.\n\nThe Group model has already inspired development activities. For example, AXA Italy launched #ANewKindOfLeadership . All 260 managers from the entity attended four in-person workshops, plus four talks with inspiring testimonials from outside the financial sector.\n\n## MANAGEMENT  CAPABILITIES\n\nAXA launched the AXA Managers Academy in 2020 to support and upskill people leaders; the first program, 'Smart Working at AXA', has been followed by 2,991 managers, representing a major milestone for the Academy.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, the academy has broadened its focus from the challenges of managing a hybrid team to the skills needed to support, motivate, and develop teams more generally. Managers will learn those skills through a program called 'Leading for Growth' which consists of four learning journeys:\n\n- 1. 'Lead with Purpose': connecting individual and Group purpose;\n- 2. 'Make it Happen': delivering results through goal-setting and performance management;\n- 3. 'Grow Team Potential': developing the skills of teams and enhancing the careers of individuals;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

'Care & Thrive': creating a work environment where people feel psychologically safe.\n\n'Leading for Growth' is available to any of the 5,058 managers who have been onboarded since the Managers Academy started spreading (1) (in 2023, two new entities joined the program: AXA Philippines and AXA UK). The first 2 learning journeys have been made available ('Lead with Purpose' and 'Make it Happen'), while the third one has been successfully piloted in December 2023 ('Grow Team Potential'). Each journey is composed of a blend of live events, discussion groups, and self-guided study. By mid2024, all four journeys will have been made available to the participating entities.\n\nAXA Spain stands out as an entity that found an innovative way to support managers. Around 350 professionals were invited to join a community of AXA Spain's Managers. At a practical level, the community (known as Connected Leaders) is a place for managers to regularly share best practices and experiences.\n\n## INVESTMENT IN TRAINING\n\nAXA is committed to investing in the learning and development of its employees. As a result, total learning costs have increased by 6.4% and the average cost per employee has increased by 3.8%. The following activities underpin the strong e/ff orts taken in 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, employees all over the world were invited to participate to the first edition of the AXA Week for Growth, an initiative designed to empower them; foster personal and professional growth; and equip them with the skills needed to thrive in the future.\n\nAmong the many global and local initiatives, employees could:\n\n- \u25a0 exchange with leaders and experts on the future of insurance or personal development;\n- \u25a0 discover AXA's diverse expertise and markets;\n- \u25a0 discover employee testimonies, illustrating diverse types of career journeys at AXA;\n- \u25a0 attend learning sessions;\n- \u25a0 learn about open positions and network across professional families;\n- \u25a0 engage in career conversations;\n- \u25a0 attend a cross-entity career fair organized by 8 entities in France (400 visitors).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAll employees at AXA can access to the large library of courses on LinkedIn Learning according to their needs (approximately 68,000 have activated their account). On top of that, AXA has proposed dedicated programs to support key areas of transformation: climate change, tech, data, and AI.\n\nThe AXA Climate Academy has increased climate literacy and an understanding of the overall impacts of climate change among AXA employees, since its inception in 2021. By the end of 2023, 96% of employees were climate certified.\n\nTo address AI, AXA launched a new program 'Data & AI for Leaders' together with the world-class business school HEC. 80 participants have strengthened their understanding of the topic through three weeks of online learning and a two days bootcamp. They worked in cross-entity teams to apply their knowledge to a business scenario - eventually pitching their ideas to a jury made up of representatives from several AXA functions.\n\n2023 also saw the relaunch of an important program for senior leaders: AXA FINE. I t focuses on developing finance and insurance business acumen. AXA FINE has been redesigned - in partnership with IMD - as a residential program in Lausanne and deployed to 30 individuals from 19 entities (with a 50/50 gender balance). The NPS of 91 of this session underlines the impact of such a learning journey. More sessions will be o/ff ered to executives in 2024.\n\nThese global initiatives and learning journeys were complemented by local programs. For example, AXA Italy developed a program titled 'Mastering Data for Insurance' with Bocconi University and AXA Japan invited their 9,000 employees to a course about human rights.\n\n## PEOPLE@AXA\n\nFinally, there has been investment in the systems that support the delivery of AXA's People Strategy. The People@AXA program was launched in 2023 and aims to transform AXA's Human Resource Information Systems.\n\nBetween now and 2026, the program will modernize systems for:\n\n- \u25a0 talent acquisition and internal mobility;\n- \u25a0 performance management - to allow for continuous feedback, and new ways of working;\n- \u25a0 data management - to increase seamless data management across HR processes;\n- \u25a0 learning - to improve learner experience, support reskilling and upskilling, and simplify delivery and reporting.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nEnvironmental protection  and more specifically the interconnected issues of climate change and biodiversity loss  are a strategic pillar of the Group's approach to sustainable development. As a result of the sustainability risk assessment performed by the Group in 2023, climate change and biodiversity loss were identified as two of the main sustainability risks faced by the Group, as described above in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nAs discussed further below, the issues of climate change and biodiversity loss are interconnected and addressed separately. AXA Group has developed policies and defined key performance indicators to track progress in reducing the adverse impacts associated with these risks. Climate change as a sustainability risk is considered in this section, with a double-materiality approach, with respect to (i) AXA Group's investment, (ii) AXA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nGroup's insurance activities, and (iii) AXA Group's own operations. Biodiversity loss as a sustainability risk is considered in this section in terms of impacts of (i) AXA Group's investment, and (ii) AXA Group's insurance activities. For more details, please refer to the following sub-chapters of Section 4.3 of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group follows the guidance of the voluntary disclosure requirements of the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) (1) , which focuses exclusively on climate-related factors. AXA SA is also subject to the disclosure requirements set out in the French regulations implementing article 29 of the Law No. 2019-1147 of November 8, 2019, regarding energy and climate, which considers more broadly, ESG issues. For more detailed information, please refer to AXA Group's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report' (2) that will be published on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com) in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n## Risks and impacts in relation to climate change and biodiversity loss\n\nAs explained in Section 4.1 of this Annual Report, the CSRD, which is applicable to financial years starting on or a/f\\_t er January 1, 2024, will introduce an enhanced concept of 'double materiality' in the context of corporate sustainability reporting in the EU. This approach considers (i) the risks and opportunities ( i.e. , outsidein perspective) and (ii) its positive and negative impacts ( i.e. , inside-out perspective) of sustainability matters of the company.\n\nFor now, AXA only considers climate change from a double materiality perspective ( i.e. , AXA Group's impact on climate change as an investor, impact of climate change on AXA Group as an investor; AXA Group's impact on climate change as an insurer, impact of climate change on AXA Group as an insurer; AXA Group's own operations' impact on climate change, impact of climate change on AXA Group's own operations).\n\nIn respect of biodiversity loss, as detailed in Section 4.1, AXA Group's impact on biodiversity loss was identified as a sustainability risk ( i.e. , inside out perspective only).\n\n## RISKS AND IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n## Definition\n\nAXA identifies the risks and impacts of climate change on AXA Group's activities and the impacts of AXA Group's activities on climate change (considering the double materiality approach). For further details refer to Section 5.1 'Risk factors' and Section 5.8 'Other material risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

For (re)insurers, the physical risks may significantly impact business and the (re) insurance industry more broadly, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, the need for new insurance products, the amount, frequency, and quantum of claims. Physical risk has a direct impact on undertakings, both through the impairments in value associated with assets held by (re)insurers and through changes in the frequency and cost of these risks on the liability side of the balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 transition risk refers to the risks linked to the transition to a lowcarbon economy, including those related to the modification of behavior and strategies of industrial actors, market participants and customers in response to climate change and related policy, regulatory and technological developments including as a result of the cross-sectoral structural changes stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Transition risk has an impact on (re)insurance products, underwriting and impairs the value of investments held by (re)insurers; and\n- \u25a0 liability risk refers to the risk of climate-related disputes, claims for compensation and legal proceedings. Examples include legal proceedings brought against insured, companies (re)insurers are invested in and potentially directly against insurers, seeking damages for contribution to climate change or for inaccurate or insu/ff icient disclosure around material financial or operational risks. There is also an increasing risk of other forms of climate-related litigation, in particular claims by shareholders and other stakeholders for so-called 'greenwashing' actions, misrepresentation, misleading conduct, mis-selling, false or misleading advertising, fraud, breaches of fundamental human rights, breaches of fiduciary duties and breaches of disclosure obligations in listing rules or other corporate regimes, or for having deficient controls or processes in place.\n\n## Assessing the financial risk of climate change\n\nClimate change could have a negative impact on AXA Group's assets and investment activities, as well as on its balance sheet liabilities and insurance activities.\n\nFor this reason, Risk Management frameworks must be adapted to the specificities of climate change related risks, whose trajectories and impacts are particularly unpredictable. In this regard, scenario analysis and climate stress tests based on di/ff erent trajectories of future climatic, macroeconomic, and financial conditions are relevant tools to conduct a forward-looking assessment of potential vulnerabilities related to climate change risks. The development of climate scenario analyses and stress testing has been accelerating, starting with the 'pilot climate exercise' launched in June 2020 by the ACPR (1) (the '2020 Pilot Exercise') and followed by a new voluntary ACPR climate stress test exercise in June 2023 (the '2023 Stress Test Exercise'). AXA Group contributed to these exploratory exercises and sees the use of climate scenario analysis as an opportunity to map out potential long-term implications of climate change on its investment portfolios and insurance business. Through this type of active cooperation with supervisory authorities and industry peers, AXA Group aims to keep improving its framework, which is aimed at addressing medium (5 to 10 years) to long-term (30 years) climate change risks, although the exercise is highly uncertain, and many methodological challenges remain.\n\nAs part of AXA Group's ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment), the ACPR scenarios published in connection with the ACPR's 2020 Pilot Exercise and 2023 Stress Test Exercise have been supplemented to better reflect AXA Group's own risk profile. In particular, Property & Casualty (P&C) physical risks have been assessed in 2023 through modular approaches (from simple to sophisticated modeling) to encompass the three drivers of natural risks (changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) and assess potential impacts ( i.e., evolution of Modelled Average Annual Losses (AAL) of forward-looking scenarios in a range of uncertainty (pessimistic versus optimistic views).\n\nBased on  risks to which the Group is exposed (including flooding in Europe, hurricanes in the U.S., urban atmospheric pollution and vector-borne diseases in France, climate-related financial risks), the estimated financial impacts on the Group using ACPR and AXA Group's ORSA scenarios are still relatively limited:\n\n- \u25a0 investments: in terms of investments, the impact of financial market scenarios on AXA Group's in-Scope investments ( i.e. , corporate bonds and equities in AXA Group's General Account assets) remains contained, based upon the 2020 ACPR Pilot Exercise. This is notably due to AXA Group's low exposure to carbon-intensive sectors likely to be the most a/ffected by the climate transition;\n- \u25a0 Property & Casualty (P&C): the same is true for Property & Casualty insurance, due to AXA Group's worldwide footprint of exposures, which creates a high level of diversification.

The Group's studies based on 2020 ACPR Pilot Exercise (1) show that, in France, the flood risk would increase by 1.5% per year up to 2050 (80% due to evolving exposure and 20% due to changing physical flood characteristics) under a pessimistic climate scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise to the end of the century. Such a change could be adequately managed in a timely manner by adapting AXA's underwriting, pricing, reserving or reinsurance strategy and fostering prevention initiatives; and\n\n- \u25a0 Health & Protection: in terms of health and Life insurance, the 2020 ACPR's Pilot Exercise again showed that the main impact stems notably from higher mortality due to the deterioration of air quality. Nevertheless, the impact was expected to be limited because, even using a very conservative approach, the assessed impact would be absorbed through management actions such as realistic repricing. The premiums would be adjusted to reflect the changes in the observed claims pattern and ensuring fair premiums for both the customers and AXA.\n\nAXA Group also explores the potential impacts of climate change on its investments with a model developed by MSCI (applicable only to corporate bonds and listed equity) where risks and opportunities are combined and translated into a 'Climate Valueat-Risk' indicator (please refer to the Section 'Consideration of Climate in Portfolio Management' below).\n\n## Mitigation of the impacts of AXA Group's activities on the environment\n\nRisks related to climate change could have adverse long-term macroeconomic e/ff ects, especially under a disorderly transition scenario that may a/ff ect all sectors.\n\nAs an investor, as an insurer and as responsible company, AXA Group seeks to mitigate the adverse e/ff ects of its activities on the environment notably through the following actions:\n\n## With respect to investment activities:\n\n- \u25a0 developing a 'warming potential' (WP) concept for its investments (government bonds), aligned with a +1.5\u00b0C trajectory by 2050, and an implied temperature rise (ITR) for corporate bonds & equities. The AXA Group WP as of December 31, 2022, was at 2.0\u00b0C and the Group ITR at 2.5\u00b0C (2) ;\n- \u25a0 reducing the carbon intensity of AXA Group General Account assets by 2025 by -20% ( versus 2019). As a reduction of 36% (3) has already been achieved between 2019 and 2022, AXA has set,\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nin June 2023, a new target of a 50% reduction between 2019 and 2030. Moreover, the Group has set a 2023 target of \u20ac26 billion of green investments (\u20ac29.9 billion were reported in 2023).\n\n## With respect to underwriting activities:\n\nAXA published in July 2023 for the first time new targets to drive the decarbonization of various of its Property & Casualty insurance portfolios and to develop its insurance activities dedicated to the transition:\n\n- \u25a0 increasing its business in the field of renewable energies, and more broadly across sectors transitioning to low carbon business models, as well as developing environmentally sustainable claims management for its motor business by 2026;\n- \u25a0 reducing the carbon intensity of the most material personal motor portfolios in the Group by 20% by 2030 compared with the 2019 baseline;\n- \u25a0 reducing the absolute carbon emissions of the Group's largest commercial insurance clients by 30% and the carbon intensity of other corporate clients by 20% by 2030 compared with a 2021 baseline;\n- \u25a0 strengthening the dialogue with its customers, particularly its corporate customers, but also with its external stakeholders and partners to better support them in the transition.\n\n## With respect to AXA Group's Energy Policy published in July 2023 (the '2023 Group Energy Policy'):\n\n- \u25a0 exiting the coal industry backed by strict investments and underwriting restrictions, as well as on other carbon-intensive industries;\n- \u25a0 reinforcing its energy policy on investments & underwriting with a specific focus on new oil 'greenfield' explorations and unconventional activities, and an alignment of climate and biodiversity ambitions.\n\nFor further details, please refer to Sections 4.3.2 'AXA as an investor: climate change and biodiversity loss maters' and 4.3 'AXA as an insurer: climate change and biodiversity loss matters' of this Annual Report for information of the scope of the 2023 Group Energy Policy in AXA's investment and underwriting activities.\n\n## With respect to AXA's own operations :\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has set a 20% reduction target between 2019 and 2025.

Tools aimed at preventing the risks of forest fires in France and flooding have already been developed and will be extended. In addition, the AXA Climate entity helps customers and investors to understand the physical risks linked to climate change that could a/ff ect them, thanks to a range of training courses and a tool called Altitude covering numerous climate risks and scenarios over time horizons up to 2050. It is also worth noting the collaboration between AXA Prevention and AXA Climate which led to Ma commune en Action ('My City in Action' in English) to help local communities better manage climate risks.\n\n## RISKS AND IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\n## Definition\n\nThe United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) defines biological diversity as 'the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems' (1) . The sustainable use of the components of biological diversity is 'the use of such components in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations (2) .\n\nAs set out in Section 4.1 ' Sustainability Risk Assessment ' in the context of AXA's 2023 internal risk assessment, AXA has again identified the Group's impact on biodiversity loss ( i.e. , the risks and impacts of AXA's investment and underwriting activities on biodiversity loss) as one of the main sustainability risks in 2023. For now, the Group only considers the risk of biodiversity loss from an inside-out perspective.\n\nIn the context of the implementation of the CSRD, the Group will consider and disclose with respect to financial year ending December 31, 2024, from a double materiality, inside-out and outside-in perspective, the impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to Environmental, Social and Governance matters that are material to the Group's activities and operations, including the risks and impacts of biodiversity loss.\n\nBiodiversity risk has been defined for AXA's internal risk assessment as  AXA's investments and insurance activities' impacts on biodiversity, by considering impacts that can adversely a/ff ect the integrity of a geographic area, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features, structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its population levels, and the particular species that make the habitat important cannot be sustained. As a result, AXA Group has announced a series of initiatives, designed to contribute to the protection of ecosystems, and actions, intended to mitigate the impacts of AXA Group's activities on biodiversity loss.\n\nAXA views the biodiversity challenge as a natural extension of its climate e/ff orts (3) . Biodiversity loss endangers ecosystem services and poses risks to society and businesses that depend on them, and in turn investors and insurers that rely on a well-functioning economy. Furthermore, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), IPCC and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) all identify climate change as a key driver of changes to nature and by extension, biodiversity. AXA did not wait for a precise calculation of the pressures and impacts of its activities on biodiversity to act. As with AXA's approach to climate change, AXA aims to harness its expertise as both an investor and insurer. As a result, the Group has announced a series of initiatives designed to contribute positively to the protection of ecosystems and to act on the nexus between climate and nature, along with ongoing e/ff  orts to improve quantitative analyses relevant to biodiversity loss to support future target setting.\n\n## Assessing the impact of AXA Group's activities on biodiversity loss\n\nAXA Group is continuing its e/ff orts working with peers to accelerate the quantification of risks and impacts related to biodiversity loss. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 in partnership with the WWF, in 2019, AXA Group released the 'Into the Wild - Integrating nature into investment strategies' report (4) at the G7 Ministerial meetings. The report contained a series of recommendations, including the launch of a Task Force on Nature Impact Disclosures which resulted in the TNFD (o/ff  icially launched in June 2021) and creating the creation of biodiversity risk metrics for investors;\n- \u25a0 AXA Group is currently a Taskforce Member of the TNFD and contributed to the TNFD's Metrics and Targets working group until the publication of the v1.0 of the TNFD recommendations in September 2023;\n\nI\n\nI",

It has partnered with an external biodiversity data provider, Iceberg Data Lab, to develop biodiversity impact metrics based on the concept of Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and published for illustrative purposes the CBF of one of its portfolios for the first time in 2023 in its Climate and Biodiversity Report (1) ;\n- \u25a0 on the insurance side, AXA is not yet in a position to globally measure the impact of AXA Group's underwriting activities on biodiversity loss, as biodiversity loss is driven by many root causes such as urbanization, invasive species, deforestation, chronicle pollution and climate change.\n\nAt AXA Group level, AXA has identified the insured assets based in Natural World site heritage and this study has helped AXA to set up the Natural World site heritage policy and restricts projectspecific construction covers for oil and gas, mining, large scale hydropower and large-scale infrastructure projects located in Natural world heritage sites .\n\nIn addition, AXA XL has developed a dedicated tool to assess the environmental risks of the Insured site including the risks to biodiversity loss notably in protected natural areas. The Environmental Sensitivity Mapping (2 ) also supports the Insured's Risk Management and prevention by developing dedicated action plans reflecting each location's potential issues and exposures. This tool is available for Europe and UK and will be available worldwide in 2024 and considered for further deployment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Mitigation of the impacts of AXA Group's activities on biodiversity loss\n\nAs an investor, as an insurer and as a responsible company, AXA Group seeks to mitigate the adverse e/ff ects of its activities on biodiversity loss, notably through the following actions:\n\n- \u25a0 integrating of ESG criteria into its insuran ce business processes and investment strategy to address risks related to deforestation and ecosystem conversion, and protected areas of key biodiversity value;\n- \u25a0 investing in natural capital fund to finance projects aiming to protect and restore natural capital, for example in forests, mangroves and peatlands, and invest in project developers to enhance their capacity to develop and deliver natural capital projects;\n- \u25a0 developing active partnerships with academia and organizations addressing biodiversity loss risks and carry out dissemination to ensure science-based decisions and address this critical issue (see Section 4.3 'Climate change, biodiversity loss and ESG-related 'outreach' and engagement');\n- \u25a0 supporting through its philanthropic activities research program focusing on marine biodiversity in the land-sea interfaces across European coastlines to improve understanding of the coastal ecosystem, especially the impacts of anthropic pollution on microbiome and its interactions (see Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer - Corporate philanthropy and engagement'); and\n- \u25a0 partnering with a consortium of scientists, NGOs, and forestry experts to experiment with new methods of forest restoration and management, including mixed species plantations, propose a more effective and sustainable way to restore damaged plantations and promote the multifunctionality of harvested forests (see Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer - Corporate philanthropy and engagement').\n\n## AXA as an investor: climate change and biodiversity loss matters\n\nThe Group defines Responsible Investment (RI) as the integration of ESG considerations into investment processes, including ownership practices. Thus, the Group's objective is to align investments with its sustainability agenda of protecting people over the long term and creating stronger and more sustainable societies. This agenda is in line with its interests as a global insurer and investor.\n\nTo this end, the Group has developed a global RI strategy covering the Group's General Account assets, and for its Unit Linked o/ff ering, where relevant. The implementation of this strategy is overseen by a specific RI governance, the Group's Responsible Investment Committee (RIC), which is chaired by the Group's Chief Investment O/ff icer and includes notably representatives from AXA's asset managers, Sustainable Development, Risk Management and Communications teams.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

It can be expressed in di/ff  erent manners. AXA Group publishes the carbon exposure metrics of its investments using three di/ff erent approaches (1) :\n\n- \u25a0 absolute emissions (tCO 2 e): total amount of GHGs emitted over a specific period (one year);\n- \u25a0 carbon intensity per revenue (tCO 2 e/$m revenue): amount of GHGs emissions normalized by the revenue generated by the corporate;\n- \u25a0 carbon intensity per Enterprise Value Including Cash (tCO 2 e/\u20acm EVIC): amount of GHGs emissions normalized by the Enterprise Value Including Cash of the corporate.\n\nThe carbon intensity normalized per Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC) approach was chosen by Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) members, partly because of the robustness of the CO2 reporting methods and partly because of the availability of data. As part of its participation in NZAOA, AXA Group commits to publishing intermediate targets every five years to track progress towards 'net zero' by 2050.\n\nIn December 2020, AXA Group announced its first 'intermediate target' of a 20% reduction in the carbon intensity of AXA Group's General Account assets between 2019 and 2025 ( e.g., 20% cumulative reduction for listed corporate debt and equities, and\n\nreal estate equity assets where possible), using the NZAOA 2025 Target Setting Protocol.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, AXA Group's balance sheet carbon intensity per EVIC (tCO2e/\u20acm EVIC) decreased by -47.6%, from 65.3 tCO2e/\u20acm to 34.2 tCO2e/\u20acm, and by -17.7% in 2023 alone. The GHG emissions financed by our listed corporate debt and equities, and real estate equity assets amounted to 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) at the end of 2023 and are covering 81.3% of the in-scope assets. This target is part of the ' AXA for Progress Index '.\n\nIn line with this first intermedi ate target, AXA announced  in June 2023 a second intermediate carbon intensity reduction objective of 50% by 2030. The measure used is the GHG emissions normalized with EVIC, using Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions data (according to the GHG Protocol). In terms of asset classes, this metric applies to the same universe: bonds and equities of listed companies as well as real estate equity, representing a total amount under management of \u20ac163  billion at 2023 year-end.\n\nAXA Group aims to measure the carbon emissions of all its proprietary investments. The sovereign debt (2) is an important part of its total as sets, representing \u20ac135 billion at the end of 2023. AXA follows the accounting methodology recommended by the NZAOA. It is based on the current version of the PCAF's Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard and using the Scope 1 GHG emissions i.e. domestic production emissions as defined by UNFCCC. Based on this approach, the carbon intensity of AXA Group's proprietary sovereign assets is the production emissions (tCO2e) per Purchase Power Parity (PPP) - adjusted GDP. The carbon intensity of a sovereign issuer cannot be directly compared with the carbon intensity of other asset classes due to di/ff erences in the calculation approach.\n\nThe carbon intensity for AXA Group's sovereign assets represented 166 tCO2e/\u20acm at the end of 2023. The GHG emissions and GDP data sources are public (World Bank, PRIMAP). It covers 99.98% of AXA's sovereign debt issuers. The GHG emissions financed by our sovereign debt assets reached 22.4 MtCO2e at the end of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, AXA Group continues its investigation of the concept of an 'investment temperature' to develop its knowledge of the impact of AXA Group's investments on climate change (climate impact). This approach labelled 'implied temperature rise' in\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "MSCI's methodology, prospectively measures the companies' alignment with global temperature goals. AXA Group's analysis shows that in-scope AXA Group's General Account listed corporate bonds and equities had a +2.5\u00b0C 'implied temperature rise' at the end of 2022 (1) . The equivalent metric applied to sovereign debt, called 'warming potential' developed by Beyond Ratings, represented 2.0\u00b0C for the AXA Group's General Account sovereign debt assets at the end of 2022 (2) . This is below the benchmark (3) of +3\u00b0C, but nonetheless shows that investors are operating in a carbon-intensive economy that is not aligned with the COP21 Paris Agreement yet.\n\n## Impact of the risk related to climate change on AXA Group's Corporate Investments: Climate Value-at-Risk\n\nAXA Group continues to explore a model developed by MSCI for listed corporate assets  to assess selected physical and transition risks and opportunities.\n\nThis model represents an estimate of how the value of corporate bonds and listed equities in AXA Group's General Account Assets investment portfolio might be impacted by climate policy risk, technology transition opportunities and extreme weather events on a 15-year time horizon. This model currently only applies to corporate bonds and listed equities and is under continuous development. Annual updates to this model allow AXA Group to expand the range of measured climate-related financial risks of AXA Group's investments and to assess them more precisely. In 2022, AXA Group changed the climate scenarios used in this metric, by adopting the five available Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios from +1.5\u00b0C to +3\u00b0C by 2100. The NGFS scenarios are recognized by central banks and supervisors, making them a credible reference in the field.\n\nTo assess future potential costs/benefits for companies in a given climate scenario (+1.5\u00b0C NGFS orderly and disorderly, +2\u00b0C NGFS orderly and disorderly or +3\u00b0C), policy risks, technological opportunities and physical risks are combined into a single Climate Value-at-Risk (4) metric. AXA Group applied this Climate Value-at-Risk model to its corporate bonds and listed equities investments under the five NGFS scenarios.\n\n## Corporate Biodiversity Footprint: Impact of AXA Group's investments on biodiversity loss\n\nBiodive rsity plays a fundamental role for human well-being and economic activities through the provision of a range of ecosystem services, including food and water production.\n\nMany policy makers, central banks, financial supervisors are starting to recognize the risks biodiversity loss poses to economic activities and financial systems, with potential consequences for price and financial markets.\n\nThe quantification of business impacts on biodiversity is still a relatively new field. AXA Group uses the Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF) metric developed by Iceberg Data Lab (IDL) on a pedagogical basis to explore the extent to which such tools allow an investor to analyze, at a portfolio level, the biodiversityrelated impact of investment activities following a similar logic to the calculation of an investment portfolio's carbon footprint.\n\nThe CBF assesses the estimated annual impact of corporate/asset/ sovereign's activity based on products and measures their impact on biodiversity throughout the value chain, caused by changes in land use, greenhouse gas emissions (climate change contribution), water, and air pollution generated by a company's activities.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, while the Biodiversity Footprint tool enables investors to obtain an approximate analysis of the key pressures and impacts of its investments on biodiversity, it is not yet appropriate for investment decisions or target-setting purposes.\n\nThe single unit of biodiversity impact used to calculate CBF is the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) (6) . MSA measures the average percentage abundance of native species in a delimited space under the influence of biodiversity loss pressures in comparison to undisturbed ecosystems. Aggregated, CBF provides a measure of negative impact, expressed as the volume of biodiversity loss caused by pressures generated by a company's economic activities in equivalent km 2 of MSA identical to pristine forest loss or, in other words, in equivalent surface of km artificialized in any given year.\n\nAccording to the Climate Value-at-Risk methodology, the climate change impact on the valuation of the companies in which AXA Group invests represents an aggregated risk of 10% (5) of the market value of AXA Group's investment portfolio under the best scenario (+1.5\u00b0C NGFS orderly scenario).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

It is also necessary to encourage increased data availability and data quality at a company level. However, for illustrative purposes only, the Group published in the 2023 Climate and Biodiversity Report, the biodiversity footprint for one portfolio (please refer to 2023 Climate and Biodiversity Report, section G. AXA Group's strategy for alignment with long-term biodiversity goals and related targets, page 31).\n\nIn addition, AXA Group continues to support the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) to help build understanding and consensus on tools available to corporates and investors to support future actions including target setting. To address risks related to deforestation and protected areas of key biodiversity values AXA Group applies its Group Ecosystem Conversion and Deforestation policy to its investments as detailed in the following section.\n\n## INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\n\nOver time, the Group has developed specific 'sector guidelines' to address certain activities in sectors that may pose certain risks to AXA Group as an investor and insurer. Among them, Coal, Oil and gas, and Ecosystem conversion and deforestation policies, which apply to both investment and underwriting activities, aim to contribute to the transition toward a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy.\n\nThese policies are published on AXA Group's website (https:// www.axa.com/en/about-us/investments).\n\n## AXA 2023 Group Energy Policy\n\nThe AXA Group Coal Policy and AXA Group Energy Policy have been updated in July 2023 and consolidated into a single policy which is the 2023 Group Energy Policy. AXA Group restrictions apply to AXA's General Accounts including, notably, direct investments in equity and corporate bonds, infrastructure, and Unit-Linked assets in fully dedicated mandates.\n\n## THERMAL COAL POLICY\n\nAXA Group bans investments, for General Accounts and in UnitLinked assets in fully controlled mandates, in a company with the following characteristics, and with immediate e/ff ect:\n\n- \u25a0 power generation companies with coal share of power production (energy mix) over 15% and/or over 10 GW of coalbased power installed capacity;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 mining companies with coal share of revenues over 15% and/ or with annual coal production over 20 million tons and/or developing new coal mines; and\n- \u25a0 certain coal industry partners, defined as manufacturers ( e.g. , equipment suppliers) and infrastructure players ( e.g. , port terminals, dedicated railways) developing significant new coal assets.\n\nFrom January 1, 2026, the above characteristics will be more restrictive:\n\n- \u25a0 power generation companies with coal share of power production (energy mix) over 10% and/or over 10 GW of coalbased power installed capacity;\n- \u25a0 mining companies with coal share of revenues over 10% and/ or with annual coal production over 20 million tons and/or developing new coal mines; and\n- \u25a0 certain coal industry partners, defined as manufacturers ( e.g. , equipment suppliers) and infrastructure players ( e.g. , port terminals, dedicated railways) developing significant new coal assets.\n\nIn addition, AXA Group is committed to a long-term 'exit' strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030 in respect of companies established or with principal operations in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world, as suggested by the main climate scenarios (such as the IEA 'Beyond +2\u00b0C' scenario). This approach is applied both to its investments and underwriting activities (please refer to Section 'Climate and biodiversity matters as an insurer' below).\n\nThe main database used is the 'Global Coal Exit List' (GCEL) (1) released in 2023.\n\n## OIL AND GAS POLICY\n\nSince 2017, AXA Group has divested from oil sands-related businesses (defined as companies deriving more than 20% of their revenue from oil sands, including pipeline operators).\n\nAs an asset owner, AXA Group has stopped any new investment in oil and gas companies in developed markets belonging to upstream, oilfield services and downstream subsectors, as well as midstream companies. Given the undiversified nature of their core business, AXA believes these companies will be the hardest to transition in the oil & gas value chain.",

However, AXA excludes Norwegian operations from the Scope, given their high environmental standards and lower operational carbon footprint;\n- \u25a0 T ar Oil Sands: AXA no longer directly invests in companies deriving more than 5% of their production from tar oil sands and in companies producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of tar oil sands;\n- \u25a0 Fracking/shale Oil and Gas : AXA Group no longer directly invests in companies deriving more than 30% of their production from fracking/shale Oil and Gas;\n- \u25a0 Ultra-Deepwater: AXA Group no longer directly invests in companies deriving more than 20% of their production from Ultra Deepwater Oil and Gas projects. Ultra Deepwater oil & gas extraction is defined as drilling that takes place at least 1,500 meters below sea level;\n- \u25a0 Infrastructure: AXA Group no longer directly invests in infrastructure assets exposed to unconventional oil and gas exploration and production.\n\nThe main database used is the 'Global Oil & Gas Exit List' (GOGEL) (1) released in 2023.\n\nAXA will also consider exceptions, on a case-by-case basis, for pure players which are focusing on transition with a majority of CAPEX in low carbon activities. To note that AXA's selection process currently results in a very limited number of companies meeting the investment criteria; less than 2% of the approximately 900 companies identified in the Global Oil and Gas Exit List by NGO Urgewald. This Policy is monitored and reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nFull details of the AXA Group Energy Policy are available at https:// www.axa.com/en/about-us/investments.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation policy\n\nThe policy on the protection of ecosystems and deforestation seeks to address risks related to deforestation and protected areas of key biodiversity value. Curbing deforestation conserves water resources, prevents flooding, controls soil erosion, and preserves habitats and biodiversity, in addition to preserving key carbon sinks.\n\nThis policy is implemented at Group level and is subject to the oversight of the Responsible Investment Committee and the Group Underwriting Committee. This  policy has been implemented by all AXA entities. In the case of the Asset Management entities of the Group, the policy has been applied to the extent that they manage General Accounts assets.\n\nThis Policy is currently under review. Full details of the current AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation Policy is available at https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/investments.\n\n## GREEN INVESTMENTS\n\nTo support its green investment strategy, AXA Group has developed an internal framework defining 'green' investments based on external labels, certifications, and environmental standards as appropriate. Green investments are defined as: green bonds (2) , infrastructure debt & equity, impact investments, real estate, and commercial real estate loans. Green investments encourage various sectors to strengthen their climate strategy.\n\nIn November 2019, AXA Group committed to invest through its General Account assets, \u20ac24 billion in green investments by 2023. In 2021, this target was increased to \u20ac26 billion. As of December 31, 2023, AXA Group's green investments reached \u20ac29.9 billion (\u20ac25.1 billion end of 2022) achieving the green exposure target. This includes government bonds and green corporate bonds, debt and equity linked to green infrastructure, and real estate that meets the highest quality standards.\n\nIn 2021, AXA Group also committed to a new 'Natural Capital' target of \u20ac1.5 billion dedicated to reforestation by supporting forestry management projects in developed markets and nature-based solutions through initiatives such as a/ff orestation, restoration and avoided deforestation which outcome can o/f\\_t en be measured through the production of carbon credits with the objective being to sequestrate/avoid 25 MtCO2 on an annual basis.\n\nAs of December 3 1, 2023, AXA Group invested more than \u20ac900 million in Forests and \u20ac300 million investment allocated in the Natural Capital Fund managed by AXA IM, financing projects that aim to protect and restore natural capital, such as forests, mangroves and peatlands.\n\n4",

These engagement activities are carried out either directly by the Group or by AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) on behalf of the Group and third-party clients.\n\nIn 2023, AXA Group  extended its direct engagement with issuers as part of its NZAOA commitment to transitioning its investment portfolio to net zero GHG emission by 2050.\n\nThe engagement objectives are to:\n\n- \u25a0 assess issuers' commitments, strategy, and performance in achieving their 2030 and 2050 net zero targets; and\n- \u25a0 align AXA Group investments with its intermediate and 2050 net zero commitments.\n\nRegarding coal in particular, AXA encourages issuers to develop and disclose an exit or closure plan aligned with AXA Group Energy Policy .\n\nThe engagement is also performed by  AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM)  with key climate engagement objectives and indicators are shaped by the TCFD framework, which has established itself as the de facto reporting framework on this issue. AXA IM's engagement approach encourages companies to:\n\n- \u25a0 commit to short-, medium- and long-term carbon emissions reduction targets that are based on climate science and with a clear explanation of corresponding capital expenditure plans;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 perform scenario analysis using a scenario where global warming is limited to the COP21 Paris Agreement goal of 'well below 2\u00b0C'; and\n- \u25a0 align executive remuneration to climate change objectives.\n\nFor more information, please refer to AXA IM's annual Active Ownership and Stewardship report, published on AXA IM's website (https://axa-im.com).\n\n## A COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY\n\nAXA's reduction objectives reflect an optimistic-yet-possible view of real economy e/ff orts for a stable and just transition. Achieving these new intermediate targets depends on a number of variables. In particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the real economy and the companies in which we invest transitioning in line with those scientific 1.5\u00b0C pathways (1) which have been used for AXA's investment portfolio reduction calculation;\n- \u25a0 governments and regulators (including insurance and financial regulators) around the world retaining, strengthening and evolving policies to achieve the emission reductions necessary to meet their 1.5\u00b0C pledges.\n\nIn this regard, measurement and disclosure is a key step in achieving emissions reductions. AXA's efforts to measure investment portfolio carbon intensity are limited by the disclosure e/ff orts of the real economy. Until this improves, actions and ambition are limited where only proxy data is available. It is possible in the future that additional assets may be included and Scope 3 GHG emissions integrated.\n\n## AXA as an insurer: climate change and biodiversity loss matters\n\nAXA Group considers sustainable underwriting to encompass both the role of an insurer to protect clients and assets to better adapt to the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss, as well as the protection of people over the long term for the creation of stronger and more sustainable societies.\n\nThe Group, as an insurance underwriter, has also a role to play in accelerating the transition to a resilient, net-zero emissions economy, reducing the impacts of its activities on climate change and biodiversity loss, while also better supporting green businesses.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## INTRODUCING A NEW GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group's sustainability underwriting strategy is comprised of two main components\n\n- 1. undertaking insurance business in accordance with the Group's stated policies in relation to sustainability encompassing climate, biodiversity and human rights (see below 'Underwriting Restrictions'). Underwriting sustainability guidelines ensure that insurance activity is conducted in accordance with AXA's objectives and values, and in compliance with any sustainability regulatory requirements; and\n- 2. availability of insurance products, services, and claims solutions that support our clients and customers with their sustainability objectives (see below 'Green products and business') while also supporting biodiversity and inclusive protection (see Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer').\n\nIn terms of governance, the implementation of the strategy is overseen by the Property & Casualty (P&C) Net Zero Transition working group, a transversal working Group which includes representatives from local underwriting teams, G roup underwriting, and Group sustainability. Matters regarding the sustainability underwriting guidelines are taken to the Group Underwriting Committee (GUC). Similar to our internal governance in respect of investments, sensitive and/or strategic climate-related decisions debated in the GUC are ultimately approved by the RISSC.\n\nIn addition, a dedicated team within Group Risk Management analyzes emerging risks which o/f\\_t en relate to long term ESG issues and monitor their potential impact (please refer to Section 5.8 'Other material risks - Emerging risks' of this Annual Report). The Group Emerging Risk Steering Board issues recommendations to adapt its business o/ff er and underwriting policies.\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN INSURANCE PORTFOLIO\n\nAXA Group extended its investment commitment of 'net-zero' to its insurance business in June 2023 with the announcement of the new underwriting portfolio near-term decarbonization targets. The specific portfolio targets are complemented by concrete objectives to support the transition with new services, products, and claims options and specific engagement targets with AXA's largest commercial clients.\n\nAXA Group reflects the carbon footprint of its insurance underwriting portfolios using both absolute and intensity metrics, specifically:\n\n- \u25a0 Insurance-Associated Emissions (IAE) is the standard measurement provided by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) (1) . This measurement provides the absolute CO2 equivalent associated with insurance underwriting portfolios for the in-scope lines of business;\n- \u25a0 Insurance- Associated Emissions intensity is the IAE divided by a financial ( e.g. , premium) or physical value ( e.g. , insured vehicles) to normalize the view across portfolios of di/ff ering sizes.\n\nThe IAE value is appropriate for underwriting portfolios with robust data, where insured clients measure and disclose their GHGs. AXA found this measurement relevant for only the largest commercial clients, for which a 2030 intermediate target reduction of 30% was set against the baseline year 2021 IAE value of 370 kTCO2e (2) .\n\nFor other commercial underwriting portfolios, where emissions factors were necessary to approximate the GHGs associated with insured clients, AXA used the intensity metric of IAE per premium. A reduction in the carbon intensity (IAE/GWP) of all other corporate clients (3) of 20% was set as a 2030 intermediate target against the baseline year 2021 value of 352 TCO2e/M\u20ac (4) within AXA's largest markets (5) .\n\nAn intensity metric was also used for the Retail Motor portfolio objective, due both to data quality considerations and portfolio characteristics. A 20% reduction in the carbon intensity (IAE/ vehicle) of 340 kgCO2e/vehicle (6) was set for the Personal Motor portfolio in selected geographies (7) , using the baseline year 2019.\n\n- (6) Only 'passenger cars' were considered due to data limitations currently for other types of vehicles in-scope of the PCAF standard.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Achieving these interim targets depends on a number of variables. In particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the real economy, including policyholders, transitioning in line with those scientific 1.5\u00b0C pathways (1) which have been used for AXA's emissions reduction calculation;\n- \u25a0 the energy transition for in-s cope economic markets, being in-line with the transition pathways (2) used for AXA's emissions reduction calculation;\n- \u25a0 the transition of personal transportation to electric vehicles (EVs) and other low emissions solutions being in-line with government commitments; and\n- \u25a0 governments and regulators (including insurance and financial regulators) around the world retaining, strengthening and evolving policies to achieve the emission reductions necessary to meet their 1.5\u00b0C pledges.\n\nIn this regard, measurement and disclosure is a key step in achieving emissions reductions. Our e/ff orts to measure underwriting portfolio emissions are limited by the disclosure e/ff orts of the real economy. Until this improves, actions and ambition are limited where only proxy data is available. The intermediate transition targets have been set on a limited scope of AXA's underwriting portfolio and only include client's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. It is possible in the future that additional portfolios may be included and Scope 3 GHG emissions integrated.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RESTRICTIONS\n\nactivities, consistent with its investment strategy, though sector guidelines (please refer to Section 'Investments restrictions' above), notably on coal, oil and gas with the AXA Group Energy Policy, and on palm oil, soy, cattle & timber with the AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation policy.\n\n## AXA Group energy policy\n\nAs mentioned above, the AXA Group Coal Policy and the AXA Group Energy Policy were updated in July 2023 and consolidated into a single policy which is the AXA Group Energy Policy.\n\n## THERMAL COAL RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn 2019, AXA Group updated its thermal coal exclusions and required AXA Group to cancel its existing business and write no new business, falling within these restrictions:\n\n- \u25a0 for mining : companies developing new thermal coal mines, clients extracting greater than or equal to 20MT thermal coal per year, standalone thermal coal mines;\n- \u25a0 for power generation : companies with coal expansion plan greater than or equal to 300 MW, any electric utility for which coal represents or comprises greater than or equal to 30% of its revenues or energy mix, standalone thermal coal power plants; and\n- \u25a0 for industry partners : any company who derives more than 30% of its revenues from the thermal coal industry or which is developing new coal assets. This specific exclusion only applies to infrastructure owners or operators (port terminals and railways), and exporters and traders.\n\nIn 2023, AXA Group strengthened the above thermal coal exclusions for new business with companies established or with their principal operations in an EU or OECD country. The restrictions were enhanced as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 for mining : any company with an annual thermal coal share of revenues greater than or equal to 15%;\n\nAXA Group strives to incorporate sustainability criteria (including those related to climate and biodiversity) in its underwriting\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 for power generation : any company with plans to develop any new thermal coal-fired power capacity, or any power generation company with an annual thermal coal share of power production greater than or equal to 15%.\n\nFor new business with companies in an EU or OECD country, those restrictions will be tightened further by lowering the 15% threshold to 10% for both mining and power generation companies from January 1, 2026 and will apply for all existing business from January 1, 2028.\n\nFrom January 1, 2030, any company with any exposure to thermal coal will be prohibited. With respect to non-OECD and non-EU countries, the full thermal coal exit is expected by January 1, 2040.\n\n## OILS AND GAS RESTRICTIONS\n\nSince 2021, AXA Group no longer underwrites new upstream oil exploration projects (greenfield) and extended in July 2023 its existing restrictions to cover new gas exploration and development so AXA Group will no longer directly insure new oil & gas exploration and development projects. The restrictions for new oil exploration and development came into force on January 1, 2024. The restrictions for new gas exploration and development will come into force on September 1, 2026.\n\nExemptions may be granted to companies with the most farreaching and credible transition plans, based on a case-bycase review. As provided in the updated AXA Group Energy Policy, a climate transition plan is a time-bound action plan that clearly outlines how an organization will pivot its existing assets, operations, and entire business model towards a trajectory that aligns with the latest and most ambitious climate science recommendations.\n\nA/f\\_t  er a comprehensive review of its transition plan, AXA may provide new standalone site-specific insurance policies to companies based on consideration of the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 companies which have su/ff icient financial capacity to fuel investments in low-carbon activities (large CAPEX) and the willingness to have a material impact in the transition;\n- \u25a0 qualitative  assessments  to  monitor  developments/ implementation of strategy, key risks and positioning relative to peers. AXA focuses on the following factors and key performance indicators: (i) energy transition strategy; and (ii) emissions management based on GHG intensity, methane emissions and emissions reduction targets;\n- \u25a0 the relevant oil and gas company's safety management, environmental management system and social cohesion; and\n- \u25a0 for insurance clients, AXA will also consider the relevant oil and gas company's pollution prevention plans and oil spill response certification.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nIn respect to unconventional oil and gas, as provided in the Group Energy Policy, AXA reduces its insurance coverage as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Tar Oil Sands : As of January 1, 2024, AXA no longer provides insurance coverage (for new or existing business) for tar oil sands activities for companies with (a) 50% of production generated from tar oil sands activities; or (b) 50% of revenues generated from tar oil sands production and oil sands-related transportation (pipelines);\n- \u25a0 Arctic: As of January 1, 2024, AXA no longer provides new standalone, site-specific insurance policies and facultative reinsurance (excluding employee benefits and treaty reinsurance) for greenfields oil and gas exploration and development projects in the AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) Region (excluding Norwegian operations) licensed after December 31, 2021.;\n- \u25a0 Ultra-Deepwater: As of January 1, 2024, AXA no longer provides new stand-alone, site-specific insurance policies and facultative reinsurance (excluding employee benefits and treaty reinsurance) for greenfields Ultra-Deep-Water oil & gas exploration and development projects licensed a/f\\_t er December 31, 2021 ( defined as drilling that takes place at least 1,500 meters below sea level);\n- \u25a0 Shale oil and gas: As of January 1, 2024, AXA no longer provides insurance coverage (either for new or existing businesses) for shale oil and gas projects carried out by companies deriving more than 30% of their total oil and gas production from oil and gas. In addition, AXA does not provide new stand-alone, site-specific insurance policies for shale oil & gas projects for new and existing clients.\n\nFor details in respect of AXA Group's underwriting restrictions with respect to conventional oil & gas, please refer to the AXA Group Energy Policy.\n\nFull details of the current AXA Group Energy Policy are available at https://www.axa.com/en/commitments/climate-change-andbiodiversity-strategy.\n\n## AXA Group ecosystem conversion and deforestation policy\n\nOn insurance underwriting, AXA Group focuses on the activities at risk of causing deforestation.\n\nThe Group restricts Commercial lines Property and Construction insurance underwriting in four cases:\n\n- \u25a0 illegal logging;\n- \u25a0 companies that are excluded by the investment policy screening are to be referred to the GUC and the critical activity will likely be banned from Construction and Property covers;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Based on the 2022 strong performance, AXA Group decided to increase its ambition and set a floor at \u20ac1.7 billion for 2023. In 2023, \u20ac2 billion of Green Premium have been underwritten , surpassing the cumulative target.\n\nPlease refer to the Green Business Report for more details and examples (1) .\n\nWhile the AXA Green Business Program adopts definitions from the EU Taxonomy regulation, the application and scope is broader than that defined in the regulation for insurers and reinsurers. For further information on the specific EU Taxonomy applicable results for AXA's insurance operations see Section 4.7 ' Transversal information'.\n\n## INSURANCE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\nOne way to protect biodiversity is to mitigate risk of loss through innovative insurance mechanisms. With a particular focus on aquatic and coastal ecosystems - which are also essential reservoirs of biodiversity - AXA XL launched in 2021 its 'Coastal Risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nIndex' (CRI) with ORRAA . The CRI is an innovative tool that maps current and future coastal flooding resulting from climate change by comparing scenarios with and without coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves. This helps build the case for nature-based solutions as the CRI illustrates the potential benefits ecosystems provide to assets and populations in di/ff erent flooding scenarios; and the estimated value of restoring lost mangroves due to their flood reduction benefits, through new global mangrove maps.\n\nAXA XL also put in place additional safeguards to support the detection of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing by requiring International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for all fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo vessels that it insures and adding further explicit checks on IUU fishing to its Marine Underwriting Rules and Guidelines.\n\nThrough AXA Climate, AXA XL is providing risk capacity for coral protection against tropical cyclones at four sites along the Mesoamerican reef in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. The pay-out will be used by the client to do restoration work such as cleaning debris and attaching corals back to the reef.\n\nAXA XL (since 2018) and AXA France (since 2023) are also providing, in partnership with Cedre (2) ( Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'exp\u00e9rimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux ), a French organization that specializes in helping governments and companies worldwide mitigate the impact of ecological incidents, tailored recommendations for companies with environmental risk insurance policies.\n\n## AXA as a company: climate change and biodiversity loss matters\n\n## OUR OWN OPERATIONS IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nAXA Group, as a responsible company, is committed to address climate change through its core operations. The impact of AXA Group's operations on climate change is identified as one of the main sustainability risks in 2023. AXA Group's own operations may have a negative impact on climate through its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions from heating and cooling, IT equipment and data centers, car fleet, and business travel. To reduce its impact and make sure it actively reduces its GHG emissions, AXA\n\nGroup has set up an environmental management system for the entire Group. The annual environmental reporting enables AXA Group to track the progress made against a set of targets that are regularly updated to reflect the Group's ambition. Entities are coordinated and have assigned targets but also benefit from regular training, best-practice sharing, and guidelines. The results of this policy are displayed in detail in the following section with the GHG emissions from energy, car fleet, business travel and IT.\n\nAXA's own operations 2019-2025 targets and 2023 performance are summarized in the table below. The reporting methodology, including the scope of the environmental indicators, is explained in the Section 4.7. Transversal Information - Reporting methodology.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA Group aims at reducing the footprint of its operations on all the 'scopes' of its GHG measured (1) :\n\n- \u25a0 Scope 1: emissions related to fuel combustion on AXA Group's sites (gas, heating oil\u2026) as well by vehicle fleet;\n- \u25a0 Scope 2: emissions from combustion of fuels to generate electricity, steam, heating and cooling purchased and consumed by AXA Group buildings and data centers; and\n- \u25a0 Scope 3: emissions from business travel, Information Technologies (IT) equipment manufacturing and purchased services, and emissions related to the production of fuels and energy purchased and consumed by AXA Group.\n\nThese objectives are based on the approach promoted by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which AXA Group joined in 2015. More specifically, AXA Group has chosen the 'Sectoral Approach to Decarbonization' to define its 2019-2025 objectives, aimed at achieving the goals of the COP21 Paris Agreement. AXA Group has submitted to the SBTi a target of -31% for own operations Scope 1 and 2 perimeters. These targets have been set for each entity of AXA Group to help them steer their emissions at the local level. In 2023, AXA initiated the review of its own operation targets to be consistent with the SBTi requirements to decrease its Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 business travel emissions. Moreover, internal operations-related carbon footprint reduction is a criterion in the Long-Term Incentive (LTI), for profit-sharing attribution as well as entities' CEO target letters - please refer to Section 3.2 'Executive compensation and share ownership' and Section 4.2 'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report.\n\nThis objective is part of a broader framework that integrates the new measures related to AXA Group's IT activities and which translates into an overall reduction of the Group's GHG emissions of 20% by 2025 compared to 2019 (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel, IT equipment manufacturing and purchased services, and upstream energy emissions). With the goal of becoming carbon neutral on this Scope by 2025, AXA Group's GHG emissions reduction is one of the components of the 'AXA Progress Index', as explained in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group does not set a target for employee commuting as the various constraints related to commuting (personal choice of employees, location, infrastructure, etc.) are not within the control of AXA Group.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nAXA Group is undertaking specific initiatives to measure additional categories of indirect emissions, such as those related to the purchase of goods and services beyond emissions already measured on IT equipment and services, or those related to the management of insurance claims.\n\nIn addition to the emissions associated with its own operations, the overall Scope 3 GHG emissions of AXA Group include the financed emissions, which correspond to the carbon footprint of General Account assets. For further details, please refer to Section 4.3 'AXA as an investor: climate change and biodiversity loss - Consideration of climate change in investment portfolio management - Carbon footprint: Impact of AXA Group's investments on climate'.\n\nAXA Group also analyzed the carbon footprint of its insurance underwriting portfolios though the evaluation of its InsuranceAssociated Emissions (IAE). For further details, please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate and biodiversity matters as an insurer Consideration of climate change in insurance portfolio'.\n\n## 2023 environmental performance\n\n## REVISED COMPARATIVE FIGURES\n\nIn 2023, AXA Group proceeded to a review of the calculation of the carbon footprint related to its own operations. The main changes are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 a separate calculation of the GHG emissions related to Scope 3 on fu el and energy related activities that were previously reported under Scope 1 and Scope 2;\n- \u25a0 the refinement of some emission factors used in 2023 and in former reporting years, notably for business travel with the inclusion of contrails impacts and the upstream emissions based on the more comprehensive data from UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural A/ff airs (DEFRA), as well as for electricity consumption that is now using more accurate factors from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB, which manages the European Energy Certificate System), Green-US and the International Energy Agency (IEA) rather than ADEME (1) ;\n- \u25a0 the refinement of the extrapolation methodology for business travel and car fleet to extrapolate transportation data for AXA's salaried workforce only (please refer to Section 4.7 Transversal Information - Reporting methodology - Scope of Social, Environmental and Societal Reporting - Scope of Environmental Indicators).\n\nConsequently, the GHG emissions of 2019 and 2022 have been revised as compared to the data reported in the previous Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

A/f\\_t er two years of substantially reduced GHG emissions due to the containment measures and travel restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of business travel has led to an increase in the total emissions compared to 2022 (+19%), that was partly compensated by a decrease in energy emissions due to energy sobriety e/ff orts in main AXA's entities.\n\nIn 2023, 38% of the GHG emissions measured by AXA on its own operations, excluding employee commuting, were related to business travel (air and rail), 31% to energy consumption, 20% to purchase services and capital goods related to IT and 12% to AXA Group's vehicle fleet.\n\n## Scope 1 GHG emissions\n\nAXA Group's Scope 1 emissions include the GHG emissions generated by the combustion of gas and heating oil burned on site, as well as the fuel used by the Group's vehicle fleets. The calculation of GHG emissions related to primary energy consumption for buildings is done using ADEME  emission factors or those communicated by the supplier for renewable energies such as biogas. For car fleet emissions, an emission factor per kilometer is applied based on the vehicle's emission range. To consider regulatory changes vehicles acquired or leased from 2020 onwards are classified according to the WLTP (1 ) standard.\n\nIn 2023, Scope 1 GHG emissions amounted to 21,598 tCO2 eq, in line with previous year. For direct energy consumption, the increase in some sites driven by the return to the o/ff ices a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis is compensated by the e/ff orts performed by other sites to optimize their energy consumption and reduce o/ff ice space.\n\nThe use of the vehicle fleet in 2023 has increased with a distance travelled up by 5% as compared to 2022, but the growing share of electric and hybrid vehicle, limited the increase in GHG emissions to 1%.\n\n## Scope 2 GHG emissions\n\nThe GHG emissions related to electricity consumption were calculated on the basis of consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). AXA calculates the emission of energy based on two di/ff erent methods (2 ) :\n\n- \u25a0 a market-based method which reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen and where certification of origin can be used. This method is the one used in the target;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 a location-based method which reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data).\n\nTo calculate the Market-based GHG emissions, when the primary source of energy is well identified, ADEME emissions factors were used. When this information is not available, AXA Group used either the emission factor provided by the electricity suppliers, or the average emission factor for residual electricity in the country or region concerned (source AIB for European countries, Green-e for United States and production mix of IEA for others). To calculate the Location-based emissions, the IEA production mix is used for all electricity consumption.\n\nFor other secondary energy sources (heating and cooling networks), AXA Group used the emission factors provided by ADEME or directly by the supplier when the energy was produced from a renewable primary source.\n\nIn 2023, Scope 2 GHG emissions amounted 30,712 tCO2 eq, decreasing by 48% as compared to 2019 and by 17% as compared to 2022 mainly due to measures implemented to reduce energy consumption in Europe that were partly o/ff set by the increase in consumption in other areas resulting from the return to the buildings a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the purchase of more renewable electricity.\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions\n\nWhile AXA Group's Scope 3 GHG emissions include GHG emissions related to business travel, digital equipment manufacturing emissions (computers, fixed and cell phones, storage tools, servers and network equipment hosted in AXA data centers), digital services purchased like cloud or network services of a subset of providers (Amazon, Microso/f\\_t , Salesforce, Orange and Google), fuel and energy related activities not included in Scope 1 and 2 (upstream emissions and transmission and distribution losses) and employee commuting, AXA Group's Scope 3 target for the period 2019-2025 only includes business travel.",

        "page_content": "To calculate GHG emissions related to business travel by plane, AXA Group used emission factors provided by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural A/ff airs (DEFRA), including contrails impacts and the upstream emissions. For the business travels by trains, the emission factors used were mainly provided by ADEME.\n\nIn 2023, AXA Group's Scope 3 business travel emissions amounted to 57,006 tCO2 eq. They significantly increased compared to 2022 (+130%) mainly due to the increase of distance travelled a/f\\_t er the end of the COVID restrictions (+66%), as well as the increase in the emissions factors for plane that were updated by DEFRA and reflects COVID impact of plane loading (up to +37%). Yet, the emissions associated to business travel decreased by 34% compared to 2019, well beyond the 2025 target of 18% reduction, confirming sustained changes of habit.\n\nPu rchase services related to IT GHG emissions amounted to 5,955 tCO2 eq in 2023, an increase of 14% compared to 2022. The capital good related to IT Scope 3 GHG emissions amounted to 23,430 tCO2 eq in 2023, a reduction of 4% compared to 2022. The monitoring of Scope 3 GHG emissions related to AXA Group's IT impacts is part of a broader program aiming at steering the impact of AXA Group's digital activities (refer to paragraph 'Environmental impact related to the use of digital equipment').\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nFuel and energy-related Activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2) GHG emissions amounted to 11,757 tCO2 eq in 2023, a decrease of 12% compared to 2022, in line with the reduction in energy consumption.\n\nAXA Group also measures the carbon emissions related to its employee commuting, even though such indirect emissions may be outside of the scope of the Group's responsibilities. It is estimated that AXA Group employees commuted a total of 889 million of kilometers, out of which 57% travelled by public transport, 34% by personal vehicles , and 2% by company cars and the rest by foot or bicycle. Scope 3 employee commuting emissions are estimated at 71,148 tCO2 eq in 2023, decreasing by 39% versus 2022. Employee commuting-related GHG emissions per FTE decreased by 41% compared to 2022 (representing 0.59 tCO2 eq per FTE in 2023). This decrease in emissions was linked to a decrease of the commuting distance travelled declared by the employees mainly due to new collection tool allowing for better data quality, as well as the increase of the share of low emitting transportation mode such as public transport.\n\nTotal AXA Group's Scope 3 emissions (business travel, digital equipment and services, fuel and energy related activities and commuting) amounted to 169,296 tCO2 eq in 2023.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## Energy consumption\n\nAXA Group's energy consumption includes the total energy consumed (heating, cooling, daily operations electricity) by its corporate sites and data centers during the reporting year. In 2023, the total energy consumption consisted of renewable energy (56%, mainly from purchased electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from renewable sources), fossil energy (42%) and nuclear sources (1%).\n\nAXA Group's total energy consumption was 223,638 MWh for 2023, decreasing by 10% as compared to previous year and by 33% as compared to 2019. In 2023, European entities have continued e/ff  orts to save energy and reduce o/ff ice space that compensate the consumption increased in other sites driven by the return to the o/ff ice a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn 2023, 32% of the o/ff ice sites included in the environmental reporting received an environmental certificate under building certification programs such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), HQE (High Quality Environmental Standard), etc.\n\nIn parallel with the certification of the buildings, the entities also implement energy saving measures in their buildings in order to reduce their GHG emissions. On the one hand, for most of these entities, these measures take the form of the installation of centralized air conditioning systems, the reduction of heating or cooling when necessary and the establishment of minimum and maximum temperature thresholds. And on the other hand, these measures are also accompanied by investments in more sober equipment such as Low-Energy Lighting (LED), double glazing to reduce energy losses and lighting by motion detector to save electricity and use light according to use.\n\nIn 2023, 63% of the electricity consumed by AXA Group was coming from renewable energy sources (hydrolic, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass) which shows an increase of 5% compared to 2022 (60%). This is mainly explained by the fact that AXA T\u00fcrkiye, AXA IM, and AXA Belgium reach the 100% renewable electricity target in all their sites this year, thanks to the subscription of renewable electricity contracts or the bought of energy certificate to compensate their emissions when they are not the landlord of their building. AXA Group's 'RE100' objective is to reach 100% by 2025, and 10 entities have already achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2023. AXA also signed a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) to support the development of renewable energy and should cover the electricity consumption of all buildings and data centers in Europe from 2025 and onward. Please refer to Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy - AXA Group's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations' for more details.\n\n## Business travel\n\nBusiness travel measured in kilometers increased by 66% between 2022 and 2023, from 124 million km in 2022 to 206 million km\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nin 2023, still explained by the rebound of business travels a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis (as explained in 'Scope 3 GHG emissions' above). However, the number of kilometers has significantly decreased as compared to 2019 (-41%) due to reductions on business travel in policies applied in many entities across AXA Group.\n\n## Vehicle fleet\n\nAXA Group's fleet is made up of commercial and corporate vehicles used by AXA's employees. In 2023, the total distance traveled by the AXA Group's vehicle fleet was 160 million of km, up 5% from 2022, but reduced by 23% as compared to 2019.\n\nAXA G roup entities are striving to reduce the impact of their vehicle fleet. As part of this e/ff ort, some entities are increasing the e/ff iciency of their vehicle fleet by o/ff ering a wide range of low-emission electric vehicles. As a result, in 2023, 12% of the kilometers traveled by AXA Group's vehicle fleet were covered by hybrid and electric cars, compared to 6% in 2022, an increase of 52%.\n\n## Paper\n\nAXA Group's paper usage includes o/ff ice paper and marketing and distribution paper (brochures, etc.) and is measured per employee. AXA Group's total paper consumption was 42 kg/FTE in 2023 versus 49 kg/FTE in 2022, i.e., a decrease of 13% and a decrease of 33% compared to baseline below AXA Group target 20% reduction between 2019 and 2025 target.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nAXA Group's water consumption was 3.9 m 3 /FTE, representing an increase of 5% compared to 2022 and a decrease of 43% compared to 2019. This reduction in water consumption compared with the target reflects better water management initiatives by the entities (dual-flush toilets, automatic faucet shut-o/ff s, faucet aerators, leak detection, etc.), but the increase compared to previous year is mainly due to higher o/ff ice footfall, notably in AXA XL and AXA UK.\n\n## Waste management\n\nAXA Group contributes to waste reduction and sorting for recycling.\n\nThe amount of unsorted waste was 16 kg/FTE in 2023, representing a decrease of 31% compared to 2022 and 58% compared to 2019. The performance is due to local initiatives, in some entities, to reduce waste and develop sorting.\n\nThe total amount of waste generated by AXA Group was 4,350 tons in 2023 compared to 5,070 tons in 2022, representing a decrease of 14%; the recycling rate (sorted waste/total waste) was 55% in 2023, increasing by 21% compared to 2022.\n\n## Environmental impact related to the use of digital equipment\n\nAXA Group has the ambition to leverage digital technologies and data to improve its operational e/ff iciency. However, for several years now, the growing environmental impact of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is acknowledged. This is why AXA Group IT launched the 'Digital Sustainability' program in 2020.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThis program aims at measuring the carbon footprint of AXA's digital activities, identifying levers to reduce it, and supporting transformation of our organization to manage its emissions.\n\nAXA Group's digital GHG footprint in 2023 is estimated at 40,267 tCO2 eq (Market-based) (1) . It is a 5% decrease compared to 2022 and a 8% decrease compared to 2019. To get comparative figures, reported emissions before 2023 have been restated to consider Scope extension and methodology changes.\n\nThis 5% decrease is the result of already launched infrastructure rationalization e/ff orts combined with sobriety levers activated by entities, and this while digital use is expanding. Scope measured will continue to evolve with a particular focus on purchased IT services.\n\nThis footprint is divided into four main categories:\n\n- \u25a0 6,538 tCO2 eq (Market-based) (1) corresponding to 42,433 MWh related to electricity and fuel consumed by power generators of data centers operated by AXA. We observed a 6% decrease in electricity consumption and a 9% decrease in market-based GHG emissions between 2022 and 2023 due to infrastructure rationalization programs and to transfer of services from AXA Group data centers to cloud services;\n- \u25a0 4,344 tCO2 eq (Location-based) (1) corresponding to 13,253 MWh linked to the electricity consumption of the terminals used by employees and contractors (computers, monitors, cell phones, tablets, printers). The calculation method is based on internal inventories and manufacturers' data. The measurement includes emissions related to the use of terminals in AXA Group sites (included in the GHG emissions of energy consumption) plus the emissions related to the use of terminals while working from home. The quality of inventories has improved and at the same time levers to reduce their number were activated. As a consequence, there was a 9% decrease in electricity consumption between 2022 and 2023, as well as a -21% decrease in GHG emissions;\n- \u25a0 23,430 tCO2 eq from capital goods related to IT that measure the impact of the manufacturing of digital equipment used by AXA Group which includes servers, network equipment, printers or terminals quoted above. The calculation method is based on inventories, manufacturers' data, and public data, as well as the average equipment lifespan. A 4% decrease in GHG emissions as compared to 2022 was observed mainly due to a more accurate inventory, life cycle extension and a 4% decrease in total number of terminals between 2022 and 2023;\n- \u25a0 5,955 tCO2 eq (Market-based) (1) from purchased services related to IT that include cloud and network services from the following providers: Amazon Web Services, Microso/f\\_t  Azure, Microso/f\\_t O365, Google Cloud Platform, Orange and Salesforce. Emission sources are mainly based on service providers' reports, and extrapolations when not complete. In the current measurement, the Group observed a 14% increase of GHG emissions between 2022 and 2023 due to the transfer of services from AXA Group data centers to the cloud purchased services and organic\n\ngrowth. This measure will continue to evolve to cover the full list of service providers.\n\nIn addition to this formal reporting, the program has kept making progress with the following activities in 2023:\n\n## Estimation of AXA Group's ICT GHG emissions\n\n- \u25a0 continuous improvement of measurement accuracy with a broader Scope now covering additional local data centers;\n- \u25a0 more entities onboarded in the Digital Sustainability program such as AXA Banque (France), AXA Seguros (Brazil), AXA Colpatria (Colombia), AXA Mansard (Nigeria) and AXA Sigorta (T\u00fcrkiye ) now reaching a total of 22 entities;\n- \u25a0 printers integrated in the Scope measured; and\n- \u25a0 more accurate inventories on workplace.\n\n## Identifying levers & reducing environmental impact\n\n- \u25a0 secure IT contribution to the 20% reduction of AXA Group's GHG emissions in operations (energy, car fleet, business travel and IT equipment and services) with the setup of a dedicated Digital Sustainability program steering committee chaired by the Group Chief Information O/ff icer and composed of entity Chief Information O/ff icers with the support of Digital Sustainability Leaders. Entities have now dedicated teams that implement operational sobriety levers and track local measurements including formal sign-o/ff  of measure and targets;\n- \u25a0 further reduce demand for new equipment by extending equipment lifespan, minimizing the number of devices per employee, considering 'Bring your own device' practices or the purchase of reconditioned equipment. This lever has significant benefits on GHG emissions but also on the impact of devices manufacturing activities on water, soil, metal demand and digital waste. A shi/f\\_t  in the market practices for longer life cycles is also discussed with Procurement and providers; and\n- \u25a0 secure timely cloud migration, decommissioning of replaced servers and assess the potential impact of new projects in terms of GHG emissions.\n\nAXA Group expects better performance from cloud hyperscalers compared to data centers it operates directly. While progress has already been made, more  transparency from cloud service providers is needed to confirm this assumption, for instance on electricity and water consumption , digital waste  and equipment lifecycle policy.\n\n## Transformation\n\n- \u25a0 improve AXA Group's enterprise architecture, software engineering, data science and data management practices to deploy sustainability by design. A network of 20 Digital Sustainability champions supports AXA Group IT experts to reduce environmental impact. This lever is important to optimize AXA Group's activities but requires time to produce quantitative results;\n\nI\n\nI",

To compensate the full year 2023 carbon footprint of this perimeter (150,458 tCO2 eq). AXA Group selected 5 projects:\n\n- \u25a0 biogas development in China: the project supports nearly 1M low-income rural Households with advanced biogas digesters and smoke-free biogas cooking stoves;\n- \u25a0 solar power project in Morocco: this project is expected to feed an annual average of 699,000 MWh of clean electricity to the Moroccan power grid. With the provision of clean energy, it enables avoiding the amount of power that would otherwise have been generated by fossil-fueled plants;\n- \u25a0 Conhuas, restoring the Mayan Jungle of Calakmul, Mexico: Conhuas is a community-based project located in an area of high biological diversity of ecosystems;\n- \u25a0 Laguna Om, restoring the Mayan Jungle of Calakmul, Mexico: Laguna Om is a community located between two large biosphere reserves. The project aims at promoting forestry and land use;\n- \u25a0 San Jos\u00e9 del Rincon, Mexico: this community-based project aims at improving forest management practices.\n\n## IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AXA GROUP'S OWN OPERATIONS\n\nClimate change may also impact AXA Group's own operations mostly via the physical risks incurred by its buildings and the\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3 CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\ndisruption in activities they can cause. Climate hazards can also impact the health and safety of the Group's employees. This risk was identified in the ESG risk assessment conducted in 2023. Information in this section should be read in conjunction with Section 5.7 'Operational risk' of this Annual Report as climate risks are part of the broader Operational Risks.\n\nOperational resilience seeks to ensure the continuity of services to AXA Group's customers, through the protection of its employees and operations in case of major events including climate hazards. AXA Group's operational resilience teams are working to reduce those risks and ensure the appropriate level of readiness to effectively respond. A dedicated governance oversees the management of incident and crisis events across the Group.\n\nThe following initiatives and policies are deployed in all the entities:\n\n- \u25a0 map, via a monitoring dashboard of natural disasters, the di/ff erent types of natural disasters threatening AXA Group's operations and implement the relevant protection measures;\n- \u25a0 following Group guidelines, entities identify the critical business processes, dependencies (both internal and with third parties) and associated resources that must be maintained throughout an incident or crisis, to ensure continuity of operations and mitigate the impact on the Group's customers;\n- \u25a0 entities prepare recovery plans for their business-critical process, to address the e/ff ects of disruptive events such as the loss of buildings, people, technology and critical third parties;\n- \u25a0 High Risk Scenario Contingency Plans are developed for the top risks that entities are exposed to, addressing both tactical and strategic considerations required to respond e/ff ectively;\n- \u25a0 AXA G roup entities' Incident and Crisis Management Teams are trained on a regular basis and conduct exercises to ensure they are well rehearsed to respond e/ff ectively and protect the Group's employees, customers, critical operations, regulatory compliance, financial performance and reputation;\n- \u25a0 regular coordination and enhancement of multi-entity Crisis planning for Group High Risk Scenarios: pandemic, catastrophic event impacting a business-critical operation, flood, cyberattacks & civil unrest; and\n- \u25a0 implementation of an information crisis management tool to ensure an e/ff ective response, even in a scenario where communication infrastructure may be impacted.\n\nI\n\n4",

These include the following initiatives:\n\n- \u25a0 TCFD: AXA Group co-presided the global industry-led Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) upon its launch in December 2015. The TCFD was set up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and chaired by Michael Bloomberg and Mark Carney (former Governor of the Bank of England, now UN Special Envoy for Climate Action). The TCFD provides guidance on how to disclose climate change risk and opportunities. In 2019, the FSB approved AXA Group's renewed membership of the TCFD, notably with an ambition to investigate the relevance of 'investment temperature' metrics;\n- \u25a0 TNFD: AXA Group is a member of TNFD. Its members include both financial institutions and corporates. It is developing an industry standard to identify and mitigate impacts, dependencies and risks related to nature. A beta framework was released in March 2022. Testing and refinement have continued until mid-2023 in consultation with key knowledge partners. AXA Group has been a member of the Metrics and Targets working group and is actively working with other members to identify the best existing approaches. TNFD membership also provides AXA Group with access to best practice on identifying and mitigating biodiversity-related risks;\n- \u25a0 GFANZ: the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) is a coalition of non-state actors committed to align with the goal of Net-Zero by 2050. AXA Group is a member of the GFANZ Real Economy Transition Plan working group. It participates in GFANZ via the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and the Net Zero asset managers Initiative (NZAMI):\n- \u00b7 NZAOA: AXA Group joined the UN-led Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance in November 2019. NZAOA is an international group\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- of institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to Net-Zero GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions by 2050. This involves regular reporting on progress, including establishing intermediate targets every five years,\n- \u00b7 NZAMI: AXA Group's Asset Management business, AXA IM, is a member of the Net Zero asset managers Initiative which brings together an international group of asset managers committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with global e/ff orts to limit warming to +1.5\u00b0C; and to supporting investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner,\n- \u00b7 Concerning NZIA: On May 25, 2023, AXA decided to discontinue its membership of the NZIA. Under the Chairmanship of AXA, the NZIA has enabled the establishment of tools and methodologies for individual companies to measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions associated with insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios. This was developed as open-source and made available not only to NZIA members but also more broadly. AXA will continue its individual sustainability journey, as an insurer, an investor and a responsible company, leveraging this toolset to set and monitor its own individual decarbonization targets and support its customers in their transition;\n- \u25a0 ORRAA: AXA Group is a co-chair of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA). This was formed following the 2018 Ocean Risk Summit. ORRAA brings together the finance and insurance sectors along with governments, non-profits, and stakeholders to: drive investment in marine and coastal natural capital; reduce ocean and climate risks; and build resilience in coastal communities;",

In 2021, the AXA Group strengthened its sustainability strategy with a pillar dedicated to inclusive protection and the integration of a dedicated indicator in the 'AXA for Progress Index' . The Inclusive Protection program aims to address the protection gap of vulnerable communities through business opportunities adapted to local conditions. In addition, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAXA Group also pursues its solidarity actions through partnerships and philanthropic activities.\n\nThe risks related to 'Inclusive Insurer' and 'Partnership and Philanthropy' are part of the sustainability risk assessment conducted in 2023. The policies, initiatives, and indicators (KPIs and qualitive information) associated with these risks are detailed below.\n\nPlease refer to Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report for more details on the 'AXA for Progress Index' (1) and the sustainability risk assessment.\n\n## Business-related societal challenges\n\nThe AXA Group strives to make insurance accessible to all. The pooling of risks, which is at the heart of insurance, creates a system of mutual support and reinforces a sense of community. As such, insurance is an essential factor in economic development and progress. However, some populations find themselves more vulnerable to risks by not having access to insurance products and services because of their financial situation, their geographical location, their age, gender, health condition, etc. The AXA Group's objective is to extend the s cope of insurance to populations that are traditionally less well-protected , notably through the following initiatives:\n\n- \u25a0 The Inclusive Protection program (as further described below);\n- \u00b7 active engagement in financial inclusion through AXA Emerging Customers,\n- \u00b7 development of inclusive guarantees and o/ff ers to protect increasing social inequalities within traditional insurance;\n- \u25a0 parametric insurance solutions to protect vulnerable populations from the e/ff ects of climate change, with AXA Climate;\n- \u25a0 insurance solutions and opportunities for women with the 'Women in Ins urance' initiative;\n- \u25a0 dedicated product labels integrating ESG criteria such as Offre Citoyenne ('Citizen Insurance'); and\n- \u25a0 inclusive economy and social-related  outreach and engagement.\n\nI\n\n## INCLUSIVE PROTECTION PROGRAM\n\nIn 2021, the Group launched its Inclusive Protection program with the objective of better protecting underserved populations with insurance coverage or services. A key pillar of this program is AXA's capacity to address clients and beneficiaries' inherent characteristics such as financial situation, age, gender, sexual orientation, health, geographical location or insurance awareness, that can result in significant protection gaps. As such, AXA is taking a wider approach on inclusive protection that is both locally relevant and considers customers' evolving needs.\n\nOur goal is to foster the integration of more inclusive criteria and practices in our di/ff erent business lines, share best practices, and report accordingly. The Inclusive Protection program targets both individual clients and businesses, across all sectors of activity, in developed and emerging markets.\n\nThe AXA Group defines an inclusive protection o/ff er as a product ( i.e. , designed or customized) or a related service that addresses a vulnerability to meet the needs of the underserved populations, in order to bridge a protection gap. AXA's framework defines the vulnerabilities to be considered. These can be caused by 1) structural situations or 2) occupational situations:\n\n- \u25a0 structural vulnerabilities: monetary/revenues, territorial disparities, gender and age, chronic diseases, lack of access to health and protection;\n- \u25a0 occupational vulnerabilities: micro-entrepreneurs, gig economy workers and migrant workers.\n\nI\n\n4",

This number includes:\n\n- \u25a0 13.6 million individuals who benefited from the inclusive insurance provided by AXA Emerging Customers. They correspond to customers that benefit from insurance coverage through distribution channels that address the needs of lowincome communities which may be excluded from insurance (see paragraph : 'AXA Emerging Customers and initiatives to foster more resilience ' );\n- \u25a0 422 thousand individuals covered through traditional insurance's adaptation that meets their needs. They correspond to customers that benefit from extended coverage against vulnerabilities that are usually excluded from traditional insurance products (see paragraph : ' Beyond traditional insurance: adapting insurance for increasing social inequalities ' ).\n\nThe Inclusive Protection program, designed with a baseline of 7 million customers in 2020, has surpassed its 2023 target of 12 million customers.\n\nThe number of customers in the Inclusive Protection program is defined as the number of policies-in-force of products in s cope of the Inclusive Protection program. Individual customers may be covered by multi-policies. Such situations are deemed limited and should not impact materially the figures reported above. For further information see Section 4.7 'Transversal Information'.\n\n## AXA Emerging  Customers and initiatives to foster more resilience\n\nAXA Emerging  Customers is a dedicated business unit reporting directly to the Deputy CEO of AXA and overseen by the Inclusive Insurance Steering Committee represented by key Management Committee members. This business unit aims to address the financial exclusion of low-income to mass market communities and small businesses around the world, by:\n\n- \u25a0 enabling vulnerable segments of the population to access insurance products and services that contribute to their financial health and accompany them in their economic progression;\n- \u25a0 adapting these solutions to customers' needs, notably from an accessibility, a/ff ordability and relevance perspective ; and\n- \u25a0 providing them with a safety net against unexpected events that could lead to falling into poverty.\n\nTo reach underserved groups including women, smallholder farmers, gig-economy workers, microentrepreneurs and low-wage workers, a wide range of distribution partnerships have been put in place with both traditional actors like banks and microfinance institutions, to more alternative ones, like digital financial services providers, retailers, public actors, and remittance companies.\n\nIn 2023, the AXA Emerging Customers business continued its expansion across its priority markets (1) and engaged in a companywide   e/ff  ort to further reinforce the strategic priority that inclusive insurance has for AXA over the long term.\n\nIn 2023, AXA Emerging Customers protected over 13.6 million individuals across 14 markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nFurthermore, AXA Emerging Customers collaborates with Group entities to create solutions at the intersection of financial, health and climate risks. In Mexico, for example, over 100,000 low-wage workers are benefiting from Life insurance from AXA provided by their employer (one of the largest retailers in the country).\n\n## Beyond traditional insurance: adapting insurance for increasing social inequalities\n\nAXA is committed to meeting the insurance needs of populations with structural vulnerabilities in key markets. AXA's approach acknowledges that many customers simultaneously face multiple vulnerabilities such as financial instability, age-related issues, gender disparities, territorial disparities ( i.e. , urban, suburban, rural areas), and health problems, which o/f\\_t en lead to gaps in the protection of our customers. This involves either tailoring existing insurance products to better serve the requirements of such customers or developing new products entirely. AXA's adaptive insurance products are specifically designed to support vulnerable populations, including microbusinesses, rural residents, elderly people, individuals with health issues or disabilities, young people, migrants, informal workers, and women.\n\nFor instance, AXA o/ff ers a range of services in di/ff erent countries to support individuals, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 in France, legal guarantees are activated to provide support for those impacted by gender-based violence, or carer guarantees that temporarily relieve the burden of sole responsibility for an elder relative;\n- \u25a0 in Italy, dedicated services are o/ff ered to support the medical needs of women and manage the health needs of children;\n- \u25a0 in Mexico, a new and comprehensive medical service has been developed, which provides high-quality care, facilities, and other benefits accessible at an a/ff ordable price;\n- \u25a0 in the UK, AXA o/ff ers a dedicated support service for people with confirmed cancer diagnoses; and\n- \u25a0 in Spain, migrant workers can access services beyond repatriation, such as legal and immigration support, translation assistance, housing, and job training.\n\nIn 2023, traditional insurance's adaptation shielded 422 thousand customers across five markets. As a component of the Group Inclusive Protection program, this section accounts for 3% of the total metric.\n\nI\n\nI",

To achieve its mission, AXA Climate has developed a comprehensive set of businesses and services around climate change: from parametric insurance against climate risk, operational alerting, climate consultancy for industries, public sector, agriculture, and financial services, to training to enhance skills and engage employees in making the sustainable transition a success. In 2023, AXA Climate employs approximately 200 people.\n\nVulnerable communities are specifically impacted by climate change and climate risks. AXA Climate is able to provide parametric insurance solutions that trigger quick and automatic payouts within a few days a/f\\_t er a natural catastrophe or an extreme weather event has struck to prevent them from falling into poverty. For instance, in 2023, AXA Climate had underwritten an earthquake cover for the Government of Morocco, which led to a quick payout of \u20ac50 million to the Government following the earthquake that took place in September 2023.\n\nAXA Climate works closely with governments and international organizations to develop public-private partnerships in emerging markets. AXA Climate's public clients include the World Bank, KfW Development Bank through its  InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF), and most major international sovereign risk pools which provide governments with protection against natural disaster risks including tropical cyclone, earthquake, excess rainfall and drought. AXA Climate also works with governments in the agriculture sector to protect farmers against yield losses due to multiple climate risks. As an example, AXA Climate supports the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme in India which allows more than 30 million farmers to benefit from agricultural insurance. Moreover, AXA Climate also works with the public sector on agriculture insurance projects at smaller scale in Pakistan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Zambia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique where it protects over half a million farmers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'WOMEN IN INSURANCE'\n\nWomen, especially in emerging countries, are less well insured than men, despite representing a significant portion of the economy. In 2014, the AXA Group published a report called 'SheForShield' (1) in collaboration with the International Financial Corporation, which studied women's insurance behaviors, needs and expectations. Since then, the AXA Group has developed the ' Women in Insurance ' initiative aimed at increasing women's access to insurance products and services as customers, as entrepreneurs and as distributors, with the following two key priorities:\n\n- \u25a0 improving access to healthcare solutions which take into account women's specific health and prevention needs. This can also be connected to the Group's involvement in supporting women in science, for example with the AXA Research Fund (see section ' AXA Research Fund' below for more details ); and\n- \u25a0 empowering women entrepreneurs to take risks and seize opportunities, with customized products and services that help them develop their businesses, while allowing them to take better care of themselves and their family.\n\nAs part of its support to women, the AXA Group has been a strategic partner of the ' Global Women's Forum ' since 2018. This partnership enables the AXA Group to disseminate its expertise, gather best practices, and take part in projects such as the yearly Gender Equity barometer (2) which highlights disparities between perception and reality on gender-related topics in G7 countries since 2020.\n\nIn addition, the AXA Group is a member of Financial Alliance for Women, a coalition of financial institutions which work together to make the business case for women's economic advancement through peer learning, research, and advocacy.\n\nIn 2023, the Group issued a guide called 'It's a Woman's World' (3) , looking at four key aspects of women's lives, the risks they face, and the immense potential women possess as a force for progress and growth. The guide details what AXA entities around the world are doing to support women, notably through the 'Women in Insurance ' initiative. It covers a wide range of products, partnerships, investments, and research projects - including those that support women-led businesses, open up access to healthcare services, improve women's finances and deepen society's knowledge of women-specific health conditions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

In 2019, this initiative was adapted and deployed on AXA France's savings contracts under the Offre citoyenne umbrella. The approach is based on an assessment toolkit built in collaboration with a panel of external stakeholders and audited yearly by an independent third party.\n\nCitizen engagements are communicated through four pillars: (i) 'Trust' ( e .g. , simple contracts for readability and transparency), (ii) 'Prevention' ( e.g. , preventive services or financial education to minimize the risks our clients are facing for themselves, their goods and their savings), (iii) 'Environment' ( e.g. , investment decisions based on environmental impact; environmental services or o/ff  ers for Damages insurance), and (iv) 'Inclusion and Solidarity' ( e.g. , product accessibility for populations usually excluded from insurance mechanisms, investments in French and European Small and Medium Enterprises).\n\nIn 2023, AXA France distributed 88 di/ff erent products in total that followed the Offre Citoyenne approach. Since 2015, 12 million contracts embedding this approach have been sold (as of December 2023).\n\n## INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND SOCIAL RELATED OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT\n\n## Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) and Inclusive economy coalition\n\nThe AXA Group has been a member of the 'Business for Inclusive Growth' (B4IG) coalition since 2019. This OECD-led coalition of private companies contributes to fighting social inequalities by working closely with policymakers to move inclusion up on the agendas at both the global and local levels. In 2023, the AXA Group co-led the 'Access to goods and services' and took part in the 'Diversity and Inclusion' working groups.\n\nAXA France is also a member of the 'Inclusive economy coalition', launched in 2018 by CEOs of major French companies, including AXA France, to act in favor of a more inclusive economy. This collective commitment is one of the private sector's responses to social vulnerabilities such as employment (apprenticeships, training), accessible products and services, and inclusive business.\n\n## Tobacco Free Pledge\n\nSince 2016, the AXA Group has been engaged in e/ff orts to divest (1) from and end insurance coverage for the tobacco industry. In 2020, these e/ff orts were o/ff icially certified through the 'Tobacco Free Pledge' label, which attests to the AXA Group's constant commitment in the fight against tobacco. Tobacco is one of the world's leading causes of death and long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, and is responsible for more than 8 million deaths per year (2) . The AXA Group believes that supporting an industry which is the main cause of long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, is incompatible with its role as one of the world's health insurers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Corporate philanthropy and engagement\n\nThe AXA Group strives to play a positive role in society, building a culture that promotes employee volunteering and financial donations to support the communities in which it operates.\n\nCorporate philanthropy and volunteering engagement support AXA Group's sustainability strategy, covering its two main pillars: (i) climate change and inclusive protection, completed by (ii) humanitarian aid, arts and heritage.\n\nSince 2022 several policies have been implemented to increase the alignment between AXA's philanthropy and citizenship activities and the Group's strategic pillars of sustainable development, namely climate change and inclusive protection. These policies aim at reducing a potential risk of misalignment between our corporate citizenship strategy and the overall sustainability strategy as revealed in the ESG risk assessment.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Thanks to the AXA Community Investment Survey (the reporting of philanthropy and volunteering activities across entities of the AXA Group), the share of activities aligned with the sustainability strategy can be monitored. In 2023, 72% of the \u20ac23.5 million of cash donations made by AXA (excluding donations made by Mutuelles AXA and those made for humanitarian emergencies which are covered by an ad hoc budget) and 97.5% of the 79,482 volunteering acts performed by AXA employees were done in support to climate or inclusion protection causes versus 78% of cash donations and 92% of volunteering acts in 2022. The target being that a minimum of 50% of philanthropic donations must be aligned with the sustainability pillars climate and inclusive protection, except donations made by Mutuelles AXA and those in favor of humanitarian emergencies. The contributing entities to the Community Investment Survey represent 96.4% of AXA's average FTEs ( versus 99% in 2022).\n\n## PHILANTHROPY\n\n## Support climate and the environment\n\nSince April 2023, AXA SA has been partnering with Fondation Tara Oc\u00e9an to support the Tara Europa expedition for a total of \u20ac600,000. This research program focuses on marine biodiversity in the land-sea interfaces across European coastlines. Researchers from 42 international laboratories are part of the mission.\n\nThis project aims at better understanding the coastal ecosystem, especially the impacts of anthropic pollution on microbiome and its interactions. The biodiversity challenge is a natural extension of our e/ff orts to combat climate change.\n\nIn France, since 2022, AXA SA, AXA IM Alts, and AXA France initiated a three-year partnership with a consortium of scientists, NGOs, and forestry experts (namely INRAE, Agro ParisTech, France Nature Environnement and Reforest'action ) called AXA Forests for Good. AXA has invested \u20ac660,802 to this partnership, which uses AXA's forestry assets destroyed by bark beetle attacks (600 hectares out of the 15,000 hectares owned in France by AXA France) as an opportunity to experiment with new methods of forest restoration and management, including mixed species plantations. AXA Forests for Good aims at proposing a more e/ff ective and sustainable way to restore damaged plantations and promote the multifunctionality of harvested forests ( i.e., host for biodiversity, carbon sink, biomaterials, influence the water cycle and human well-being). This initiative is intended to be shared with forest ecosystem stakeholders and the broader public.\n\n## Support i nclusive p rotection\n\nAXA SA has been supporting the Pierre Claver Association since 2008 with an annual donation of \u20ac200,000. The Pierre Claver Association has been developing a model for the sustainable integration of refugees in France, working alongside volunteers and students, and supported by major donors, including AXA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Association welcomes around 400 refugee students a year: 250 students take classes at the school, located in the heart of Paris, and 150 students are in contact with the Association remotely. The cohorts of students consist of refugees who have been granted asylum, selected through interviews, based on their desire to improve their chances of a successful life in France and to strengthen their ties with French society.\n\nThe educational program includes language classes of di/ff erent levels, workshops on French culture, artistic and sports activities and cultural trips. Every student is paired with a tutor, and they have a meeting every week: the tutor's role is to encourage the student to look to the future, develop projects, and measure their ability to set objectives. Students willing and able to enroll in a higher education institution have an opportunity to secure funding for that through a scholarship program sponsored by corporate partners, specifically AXA SA. Students receive academic guidance and are assigned a mentor for the duration of their studies, up until their first job.\n\nAXA's support takes many forms: from team building activities with AXA Hearts in Action to making significant donations as one of the association's main donors. In 2023, Group Communication & Engagement team welcomed two interns from the Association Pierre Claver for a month-long internship to explore the field of communications and learn more about AXA SA as a company.\n\n## Humanitarian aid\n\nIn 2023, AXA SA renewed its support towards the people of Ukraine by supporting the UNHCR with an additional donation of \u20ac500,000 to refurbish collective housing and repair private houses destroyed by bombing and attacks.\n\nIn 2023, AXA SA supported the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its emergency response a/f\\_t er the earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria through its donation of \u20ac2 million to provide shelters, distribute food and products of first necessity and take care of the wounded. In September 2023, following the earthquake in Morocco, AXA SA donated \u20ac500,000 to the ICRC to assess the needs on the ground and provide support to the a/ff ected population.\n\nIn September 2023, a/f\\_t er the emergency alert given by Les Restos du C\u0153ur , AXA SA decided to support three organizations acting in the area of food support in France by donating \u20ac1.7 million to Les Restos du C\u0153ur , \u20ac400,000 to Banques Alimentaires and \u20ac400,000 to Action Contre la Faim. Les Restos du C\u0153ur were created in 1985 to fight poverty and exclusion in all its forms in France.\n\n## Culture and the Arts: protecting our common memory and transmitting our cultural heritage to future generations\n\nAligned with its values of protecting and transmitting cultural heritage, AXA SA has been committed for decades to significant world heritage conservation actions and has more recently supported several projects in France such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the reconstruction and restoration of Notre-Dame de Paris (major patron since 2019);\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

For instance, since 2019, AXA France is a major patron of the Fondation du Patrimoine (French Patrimony Foundation). As for AXA Spain, its collaboration with the Prado Museum began in 1998, making it the first private entity in Spain to become a benefactor of the Museum.\n\n## EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERING\n\nAXA Hearts in Action is the international volunteering program for AXA Group's employees. Under this umbrella, employees carry out activities on themes aligned with the two pillars of our sustainability strategy: climate change and inclusive protection. Since 2020, an international sponsorship Committee has been set up to anchor the program even more strongly within the various entities.\n\nIn 2023, 37,650 AXA employees took part in volunteering actions and 2,285 NGOs were supported.\n\nAXA Group's employees were involved in a wide variety of activities (3,335 in total) and performed 79,482 acts of volunteering (compared to 56,500 in 2022). Through the AXA Hearts in Action program, the Group seeks to promote all forms of employee engagement, particularly skills-based volunteering. In 2023, AXA France continued to develop the 'AXA Comp\u00e9tences Solidaires ' program: 105 employees volunteered in partner associations ( versus 130 in 2022).\n\nAXA Group's employees volunteered 290,000 hours during and outside of working hours (compared to 317,750 hours in 2022) in support of solidarity projects. Most of these volunteer hours were spent during working hours: 91,314 hours for Comp\u00e9tences Solidaires and 71,404 hours for other activities, for a total of 162,718 hours (compared to 253,775 hours in 2022).\n\nWithout Comp\u00e9tences Solidaires , the number of volunteering hours amounts to 198, 000.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFor the past 13 years, the AXA Week for Good has been organized to highlight the community investment of AXA employees. During the 2023 edition of the AXA Week for Good, a total of 21,167 employee volunteers were mobilized across the Group ( versus 15,400 volunteers in 2022).\n\nIn 2023, employees of AXA France voluntarily enrolled in the Engag\u00e9 pour secourir program as reservists in the army. This program enables AXA France reservists and first aiders to benefit from days o/ff  for training, and to be released in the event of an Act of God ( force majeure ), if they are called up by their corps.\n\n## AXA RESEARCH FUND\n\nThe AXA Research Fund (AXA RF or the Fund) is committed to supporting science to enable a long-term science-based sustainable strategy. The Fund supports top-tier research projects on key areas of risks and engages in dissemination e/ff orts based on science to better inform decision-making. With a global commitment of \u20ac256 million since its launch in 2008, the AXA RF has funded approximately 725 projects that explore solutions for global societal challenges in climate and environment, health, and socio-economic risk. The selection of research projects is overseen by an independent Scientific Board and based on excellence and innovation.\n\nIn 2023, the AXA RF renewed its mandate for five additional years, to pursue its philanthropic mission with three priorities: increasing impact, influence and visibility. The Fund has published a report on the impact of its last five-year mandate on science, the scientists and society.\n\nWith respect to academic funding, two chairs were selected each for an amount of \u20ac1 million over five years: in the field of health risks, the AXA Chair on Menopause and Cardiovascular disease at the University of Seville (Spain) and in the field of climate risks, the AXA Chair on Water Quality and Global Change at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium).\n\nIn December 2023, following a call for projects on renewable energy to ensure a sustainable and fair transition, an additional \u20ac973,000 was granted to seven post-doctoral researchers. They will work on improving assessment and designing new climate adaptation approaches to those risks.\n\nConcerning the transversal matter 'climate crisis is a health crisis' as per WHO/COP 28: the AXA RF and AXA UK have recently initiated a new partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to establish a global observatory for vector-borne disease outbreaks to address the challenges posed by climate change on human health. This includes an outbreak forecasting system that will give a direct and immediate measurement of climate and climate change's impact on the risk of dengue outbreaks and a wide range of other diseases.",

The partnership is endowed with \u20ac1 million for a three-year period. The first annual call for proposals on cyber risk was launched on December 1, 2023.\n\nAlongside AXA XL, the AXA RF also joined the Systemic Risk Hub at University of Cambridge for a three-year project focusing on systemic risk under the transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with its ambition of impactful dissemination of supported research, the Fund launched two new initiatives in 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 Master Science, a series of open access master classes aimed at helping decision makers and practitioners benefit from insights from best scientists on challenges of our times. Master Science was launched in July, broadcasting the first five master classes (on Nature Based solutions, future of healthcare, invasive species, gender gap in business); and\n- \u25a0 a digital campaign helped promote the series and generated a first 26 thousand masterclasses views. In July also, a LinkedIn page was launched to engage our academic and expert communities and accelerate visibility of supported research. In six months, it reached an audience of circa 1,900 qualified users by end of December 2023.\n\nIn parallel, the  Fund also pursued its regular activity of media training (15 new grantees trained and practiced pitching their research). The Fund also continued engaging its active community of scientists from varied disciplines and backgrounds through a large variety of events, webinars, master classes, publications, and articles with partners such as The Conversation (1) (16 articles).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This commitment is designed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where the Group operates, to earn the continued trust of its clients, shareholders, employees, and business partners, but also frequently extends beyond legal obligations particularly in the Group's priority areas.\n\nAs a result of the 2023 sustainability risk assessment presented in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy - Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## I Business ethics\n\n## COMPLIANCE & ETHICS CODE\n\nAXA Group Compliance & Ethics Code seeks to establish Groupwide rules and guidelines to ensure that AXA Group companies and employees have a common understanding of the compliance and ethical standards the Group requires. The Code covers a variety of matters and topics, including specific rules concerning conflicts of interest, anti-bribery and corruption, insider trading, management of confidential information, etc. The Code is available on the Group's website (1) .\n\nThe Group revised the AXA Group Compliance & Ethics Code in 2019, including topics such as: health & safety at work, protection and responsible use of customer data, engagement with social media, prevention of discrimination and harassment, and fair and professional treatment of customers.\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY AND FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nIn order to tackle the risk of bribery and corruption, AXA Group has a Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (the 'ABC Policy') that establishes the minimum standards for anti-bribery and corruption that must be implemented by AXA entities. This policy is updated on an annual basis to notably take into account regulations (for example, the French law known as ' Sapin II ' n\u00b02016-1691 of December 9, 2016, on transparency and the fight against\n\nrisk assessment' the following business behavior topics were identified as risks: anti-bribery and the fight against corruption, business ethics, responsible use of data & AI, data privacy and data security, sustainable procurement and tax policy.\n\nThe policies presented below cover these business behavior risks. Associated key performance indicators are explained in the following paragraphs.\n\ncorruption and the modernization of the economy). A Group anti-bribery o/ff icer oversees the global ABC policy at Group level and monitors its implementation in all the entities. AXA entities have designated local anti-bribery o/ff icers to implement their local policies in accordance with the Group's ABC Policy.\n\nAXA Group standards certification by entities' CEOs includes an 'anti-bribery and fight against corruption' section. Our objective is to achieve a consistent anti-bribery and anti-corruption program across the Group's entities, which includes the necessary requirements that comply with international standards (including Sapin II Law) and prevent corruption risks.\n\nAs a result, each year since 2018, for all the entities in s cope of the AXA Group Standards, 100% of CEOs have certified on the compliance level of their entities with the anti-bribery and corruption section (2) .\n\n## BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nAs mentioned above, business ethics were assessed during and for the purpose of the 2023 sustainability risk assessment, and more specifically the risk of mis-selling or non-transparent selling practices, mismanagement of claims, resulting in a low protection of customers in their interactions with AXA Group and life of their contract, and resulting in a loss of trust.\n\nI\n\nI",

See Section 7.3 'General information' for more detail on the applicable regulation) but also in many other countries where the AXA Group operates such activities - designed to increase customer protection in the financial services sector. AXA Group has taken actions to comply with these requirements in each of its businesses where such measures are in place and to globally spread and implement a customer protection culture across the Group. In addition, the Group demonstrates a strong commitment in its Compliance and Ethics Code, which applies to all employees and subsidiaries worldwide, to treat its customers fairly and professionally, by being honest and accountable when promoting products and services.\n\nSince 2021, a set of recommendations on key customer protection topics ( e.g ., complaints, digitalization, product oversight and governance) have been shared with the objective of reinforcing uniformity of practices within the Group and, at the same time, continuously improving customer consideration wherever they may be. Key customer protection issues include vulnerable customers, customer information, digitalization, and complaints handling. These recommendations guide each entity in implementing responsible practices based on transparency, honesty, and fairness for the customer.\n\nA compliance program of customer protection reviews has been reinforced since 2019. It consists of reviewing how local entities manage customer protection topics and the processes in place, especially regarding customer information, sales practices, or salesforce training. In 2023, seven entities, including for the first time non-European entities, had a customer protection compliance review on their business practices.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompliance risks, including business conduct, are also assessed on an annual basis. The results and any necessary mitigation actions are shared with senior management. Internal verification processes have been implemented to monitor the e/ff ectiveness of such controls and cover entities' own operations and those of proprietary sales channels.\n\nAnother key initiative in managing business conduct is the product governance process (Product Approval Process, 'PAP') which oversees the design, approval, and review of new or significantly modified products, including all the Product Oversight and Governance ('POG') requirements. The PAP is applicable to all entities of AXA Group with underwriting activities and focuses notably on the customer dimension, ensuring the product is built starting from the customers' needs and expectations, with a definition of the target market and a selection of adequate distribution channels. This process also aims at ensuring that all new products entering the scope of application (all entities with underwriting activities) of the PAP respect the principles of 'value for customer'. It includes notably a mandatory compliance checklist.\n\nEvery year since 2018, for all the entities in s cope of the AXA Group Standards, 100% of CEOs have certified on the compliance level of their entities with the AXA Standards (5) , which engaged them to conduct a PAP on all Life & Health and Property & Casualty products.\n\nIn 2023, for all the entities in scope of the AXA Group Standards, 100% of CEOs have certified the compliance level of their entities with the newly introduced 'Conduct & Customer protection' section.\n\n4",

These rules represent an internationally recognized standard. They have been approved by European data protection authorities. Binding Corporate Rules are integrated into AXA's own governance structure to make sure these are well applied. Group entities that are applying Binding Corporate Rules represent 99% of the Group's revenues in 2023 (also 99% in 2022 and 2021) in line with the 99% target. These rules and the Group's Data Privacy Declaration, whereby the Group undertakes not to sell the personal data of its customers, are available on AXA website (1) .\n\nThe Group implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR (2) ) and is also implementing similar regulations recently adopted in countries outside the European Union.\n\nIn 2023, out of 95 million customers, the Group received 497 customer's complaints with respect to data privacy, equivalent to 0.0005% customers ( versus 471 complaints in 2022, equivalent to 0.0005% of customers and 1,127 complaints in 2021, equivalent to 0.0012% of customers). This ratio is under the yearly target of 0.01% (which means less than 9,500 complaints for 95,000,000 clients).\n\n## A SECURITY STRATEGY DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF DATA\n\nWith the massive digitalization of society, cyber risk is considered today one of the top operational risks that citizens and companies are facing. Cyber risk, listed as a top risk in the 2023 Future Risks Report (3) , is closely monitored by the Board of Directors, which gets a quarterly report on AXA's security, also covering the evolution of the threat landscape. The Board of Directors relies on the Audit Committee to ensure appropriate mitigations are in place.\n\nTo respond to this threat, and as a responsible insurer, AXA Group has developed a risk-based security strategy that strengthens its business resilience, transforming security from a necessity to an advantage for its entities. Security is managed holistically by the corporate function, Group Security. It gathers the four security key disciplines: Information Security/Cyber Security, Operational Resilience, Physical Security and Health & Safety.\n\nAXA Group has finalized the implementation of its 'One Security' strategy in 2023, which successfully strengthened security maturity within AXA's entities, while maintaining the most mature ones within the first quartile of the most secure companies in the financial industry. The risk-based approach used ensured that we continuously consider and adapt to the evolution of risks and threats.\n\nThe maturity level of AXA entities is assessed, based notably on the ISO 27001 norms  (see Section 4.7 'Transversal information - Definitions of key performance indicators'). In 2023, the Group successfully achieved a maturity score of 3.47 out of 5, with an increase of 0.17 over the previous year's results (on a representative scope of 20 mature AXA entities), contributing to the goal of remaining among the safest organizations in our sector.\n\nThis robust level of security is also ensured by the commitment of the Group's employees, who are the first line of defense against cyberattacks. Yearly training on the topic of security (including physical security, health & safety, operational resilience & information security), data protection and cybersecurity are deployed across the Group. In 2023, 100% of salaried employees have been trained and certified.\n\nConscious about the fact that risks could also come from its environment, AXA Group takes third-party supervision seriously.\n\nI\n\nI",

In 2023, AXA published 11 academic papers in top international venues, nine of which were co-authored through its three academic partnerships with Sorbonne University, Stanford University and EPFL. AXA was also involved in co-supervising several PhD and master's theses on Responsible AI topics, including the successful defense of a PhD thesis on the conception and evaluation of Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) for complex machine learning systems. One of the PhD theses defended in 2022, on AI Fairness, was also awarded 'Best PhD thesis in AI in France' by the French association AFIA ( Association fran\u00e7aise pour l'Intelligence Artificielle ). Finally, as part of TRAIL (Trustworthy and Responsible AI Lab), a joint research lab created in 2022 with the Sorbonne University, AXA co-organized seven research seminars featuring international and young researchers on Responsible AI.\n\nAlong with other members (industrial partners, consultancies, schools, and technology companies), AXA is also a leading contributor to Impact AI, a French think tank dedicated to ethics and Responsible AI . In 2023, this working group notably published practical recommendations on the governance of Generative AI/LLMs and a barometer study on the perception of AI and trustworthy AI by French citizens and employees (1) .\n\nTranslating AXA Group's sustainability strategy and commitments into its management of vendors is indeed a key issue for the Group. Policies and key performance indicators on sustainable procurement are presented in the Group's Vigilance Plan in the following Section 4.6.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This risk assessment was conducted by an independent firm which used a three-step methodology:\n\n- \u25a0 first , relevant rights to be assessed (based on overarching Charters, labor rights core conventions and specific conventions (1) ) were prioritized. This prioritization identified risks in areas such as forced labor (rights of children, right to adequate standard of living, right to be free from slavery, right to life, liberty, and personal security), discrimination (right to equality, right to be free from discrimination, freedom of belief and religion), inclusion of vulnerable populations (rights of persons with disabilities, elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, right of indigenous people to natural resources, rights of migrant workers) and working conditions (freedom of opinion and expression, right of peaceful assembly and association, right to decent work and to join trade unions, right to social security, to education, to rest and leisure);\n- \u25a0 second, the level of risk (high, moderate or low) was assessed through a two-tiered analysis based on severity and remediability across the relevant populations (employees, insurance product beneficiaries, investee companies, suppliers and contractors);\n- \u25a0 third , a review of mitigative measures in place was conducted through a documentary review and interviews to assess the current level of Risk Management at the AXA Group.\n\nThis assessment ('\n\nHuman Rights Risk Assessment 2022\n\nReport ') which includes the mapping of the identified risks and the measures taken to limit their impact, is available on the AXA Group's website (https://www.axa.com/en/commitments/ our-commitment-to-human-rights).\n\nIn addition to the initiatives described above, from June 2022, a human rights risk assessment has been integrated into the due diligence process implemented for potential mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nThe human rights risk assessment is undertaken regularly by the Group, and at least every three years in addition to the annual sustainability risk assessment described in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's Sustainability strategy - Sustainability risk assessment'. The next human rights risk assessment will be carried out in 2025, if not earlier.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\nEnvironmental risks (climate change and biodiversity loss) were identified in the AXA Group's sustainability risk assessment as two of the main  sustainability risks for AXA Group as detailed in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's Sustainability strategy - Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe AXA Group's environmental footprint on own operations is essentially related to the operation of o/ff ices and IT materials, business travel , water, electricity, paper consumption and other staple consumer products and generation of waste. In addition, AXA Group's environmental footprint also includes its indirect impact resulting from its investments and underwriting activities.\n\nIn respect of its own operations, the AXA Group's direct environmental reporting and management processes focus on energy, car fleet, business travel, IT equipment and services as well as related CO2 emissions. Water consumption and waste generation are also assessed yearly. These processes are verified by an independent third-party and, allows the Group to (i) evaluate its impact on the environment every year and (ii) identify the risks stemming from its own operations for the environment.\n\nI\n\nI",

The methodology of this assessment involves evaluating both the severity and probability of a particular job or task. Severity refers to the potential harm or impact an event could have, while probability refers to the likelihood of the event occurring. By combining these two factors, entities can prioritize risks based on which ones are most likely to cause the most harm. For example, a high severity and high probability risk would be given higher priority than a low severity and low probability risk. By focusing on the most critical risks first, AXA entities address potential hazards in a more e/ff ective and e/ff  icient manner, ultimately improving overall health and safety.\n\n## MAPPING OF RISKS IN AXA'S SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nIn 2023, the AXA Group updated its methodology for identifying and assessing the ESG risks associated with the value chain in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nG eneral E xpenses and IT P rocurement categories. Through an analysis of ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards defined by the CSRD), 21 risks relating to ESG were identified for the purpose of the procurement activities of the Group, based on current supply chains, across five key areas:\n\n- \u25a0 environmental (GHG emissions & energy consumption, pollution, water consumption, land artificialization & deforestation, resource extraction & depletion);\n- \u25a0 fundamental freedoms (illegal work (not declared work/illegal workforce), unfair employer practices, inability to provide decent wage, harassment & abuses, lack of fair & transparent consumer engagement);\n- \u25a0 health and safety (poor & hazardous working conditions, product safety);\n- \u25a0 human rights (child labor and/or forced labor, discrimination/ inequal opportunities, impacts on local communities, conflict funding);\n- \u25a0 business integrity (lack of transparency on governance & political influence, corruption/bribery, unfair relationship with suppliers, anti-competitive practices, data security).\n\nThe criticality of each risk is assessed by procurement category, taking into account its severity and probability. This assessment is used to classify the Group's procurement categories according to an appropriate level of sustainability risk - namely, low, medium or high. Based on this framework, the vigilance measures implemented by the AXA Group are strengthened as the yearly ESG assessment will include all suppliers and sub-contractors identified in high-ESG risk procurement categories with significant yearly spend through the risk mapping, ( e.g. , gi/f\\_t s & branded goods, telephony).\n\n## Procedures for regular assessment of subsidiaries, sub-contractors or suppliers\n\n## AS A COMPANY\n\nThe AXA Group relies on a reporting process for Group entities which is based on an internal review conducted by the Group sustainability team. In addition, all local procurement teams are required to comply with the mandatory requirements and commitments set out in the Group Sustainability Standards.\n\nTo implement improved procedures for regular assessment of its subsidiaries as well as improved monitoring of local procurement processes at key stages of the contract  lifecycle, the ESG  Risk Management guidelines which support the Group sustainability standards are expected to be updated in 2024.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

For procurement contracts, all local procurement teams across the Group shall implement standards which must be followed by.\n\nFor example, AXA Group personnel working in a procurement department must:\n\n- \u25a0 sign the Group's Code of Professional Conduct and the Code of Ethics;\n- \u25a0 include a 'Sustainability clause' in purchasing contracts;\n- \u25a0 implement an assessment of extra-financial risks of its suppliers, identified by an internal risk matrix by procurement category; and\n- \u25a0 attend sustainability awareness sessions given by the network of Sustainable Procurement personnel identified in the Group's various entities.\n\nThe ambition is to be able to identify and act on serious controversies linked to human rights abuses and negative environmental impacts or business ethics alerts involving suppliers.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## AS AN INSURER\n\nIn respect of  underwriting activities, AXA group entities are expected to comply not only with applicable legal and regulatory requirements relating to sustainability but also the AXA Group's voluntary sustainability commitments, including commitments to limit or decline to o/ff er or renew insurance coverage for risks and customers which are identified as failing or likely to fail to meet the AXA Group's sustainability criteria.\n\nDetailed requirements for P&C underwriters are provided in the Sustainability Underwriting Guidelines. These are internal guidelines which have been made available since 2022 to all local entities that carry out underwriting activities. The guidelines comprehensively integrate the AXA Group's voluntary sustainability commitments into its P&C underwriting governance framework, ensuring that P&C direct insurance and assumed reinsurance activity is conducted in accordance with the AXA Group's Sustainability objectives and values. These set out the risks and types of customer which AXA group entities are prohibited from, or restricted in, in underwriting, as well as applicable assessment criteria, while outlining an escalation framework for issues and sensitive cases encountered in the underwriting process which might otherwise result in a breach of the AXA Group's sustainability commitments. In all situations, AXA group entities are expected to liaise with Group Underwriting O/ff ice at an early stage.\n\n## AS AN INVESTOR\n\nIn respect of our investment activities , AXA has put in place restrictive investment guidelines to address certain activities in sectors that may pose certain risks to AXA as an investor. For more information on these sectors, please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss - AXA as an investor: climate change and biodiversity loss matters' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe restricted lists are implemented and monitored on a regular basis by the asset managers managing the AXA's General Account.",

To build onto AXA's journey towards Pay Transparency that will be pursued over the next strategic plan, AXA has made a new commitment to o/ff er all employees a total cash remuneration of at least 110% of the local living wage by the end of 2026. Such recognition enables AXA to progress further on its longterm commitment towards an inclusive and supportive global workplace culture and society. In particular, AXA signed and went beyond the 'Business For Inclusive Growth' (B4IG) pledge as part of the UN Global Compact 'Forward Faster' initiative to ensure that 100% of its employees across the organization earn a living wage by 2030.\n\n## Protection of Employee Safety, Health, and Security\n\nAs detailed in Section 4.2 'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report, AXA is committed to its purpose (its raison d'\u00eatre to ' act for human progress by protecting what matters') .\n\nAs regards employee health, in November 2020 the AXA Group launched an innovative global program to improve the health and wellbeing of its employees around the world. This program, the ' Healthy You ' program, was extended in 2021 and is now implemented in all AXA entities globally.\n\nIn 2023, the AXA Group announced the launch of its ' We Care ' program which aims to provide all employees with the time, support, and resources to make personal and professional decisions with confidence and enables further progress on its long-term commitment towards an inclusive and supportive global workplace culture. In addition, the ' We Care ' program provides support to its workforce particularly where health and safety is at issue through the implementation of policies focused on providing support and protection to caregivers, parents, victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n\nThe ' We Care ' program, which will be one of AXA's key milestones for its 'Unlock the future' strategic plan, and is expected to be deployed across all AXA entities by the end of 2024 through four main pillars: (i) parental leave, including support for employees receiving and recovering from in-vitro fertilization, or in the case of pregnancy loss, (ii) caregiver leave, (iii) support for employees if they experience domestic and sexual violence, and (iv) an expansion of the ' Healthy You ' program to include a supportive working environment for employees experiencing menstrual health conditions, menopause, or andropause.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

These rules represent an internationally recognized standard, approved by European data protection authorities. Binding Corporate Rules are integrated into AXA's own governance structure to make sure these are well applied. Group entities that are applying Binding Corporate Rules represent 99% of the Group's revenues in 2023 (also 99% in 2022 and 2021) in line with the 99% target. These rules and the Group's Data Privacy Declaration, whereby the Group undertakes not to sell the personal data of its customers, are available on AXA website (1) .\n\nIn addition, to respond to the cyber risk threat, the AXA Group has developed a risk-based security strategy that strengthens the AXA Group's business resilience. See further details on personal data protection by AXA Group in Section 4.5 'Business behavior - Responsible use of data and AI, data privacy and data security' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Protection of the Environment\n\nThe AXA Group's Environmental Policy, available on the Group's website (2) , describes key actions aimed at reducing the AXA Group's direct and indirect environmental impacts.\n\nThe AXA Group's environmental targets included in its 2025 environmental strategy are notably focused on the reduction of carbon emissions, one of the main contributors to climate\n\nchange. Some of AXA Group's carbon emissions reduction targets for 2019-2025 are based on an approach promoted by the 'Science Based Targets' initiative. Ahead of the energy disruption that was expected during 2022 winter in Europe, an Energy Sobriety & Resilience Task Force was launched to accelerate energy consumption reduction by the end of 2023 and ensure resilience in case of energy disruption.\n\nAlso, a number of the buildings occupied by the AXA Group benefit from environmental certificates such as BREEAM, LEED and HQE. Please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss' of this Annual Report for further details on AXA Group's certifications.\n\nThe AXA Group also supports initiatives related to climate change and environmental protection, as detailed in Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss'. In addition, the Group's Responsible Investment Policy is available on the AXA Group's website (3)\n\n## AS A BUSINESS PARTNER\n\nAXA Group cont inuously strives to improve sustainability engagement and procedures with its suppliers in order to mitigate risks and prevent serious harm (see paragraph 'Procedures for the regular assessment of subsidiaries, sub-contractors or suppliers - As a business partner ' above).\n\n## AS AN INSURER\n\n## Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Policy\n\nThe AXA Group strives to support its customers' rights while preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts that may result from the provision of insurance products and services to corporate customers, in particular by seeking to:\n\n- \u25a0 ensure fair treatment of all customers;\n- \u25a0 o/ff er products designed to meet the needs and expectations of its customers;\n- \u25a0 design products and services to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, in order to reduce insurance coverage disparities, closing the protection gap and empowering insured people to achieve positive outcomes with regards to their financial resilience.

The monitoring of the implementation of vigilance measures and assessing their e/ff ectiveness, is carried out, at a high level, by the Group's system of internal control.\n\nIn addition, the AXA Group relies on a reporting process for Group entities which is based on an internal review conducted by the Group Sustainability central team, the AX A Entities Sustainability Index (the 'AESI'). Conducted each year, the AESI is the Group's internal system for promoting and assessing the implementation of the Group's ESG guidelines and standards at the level of each of the AXA entities.\n\nIn  2023, the AESI was completed by 29 AXA entities (compared to 30 in 2022) (1) . The AESI questionnaire consists of 21 questions related to the Group's ESG strategy implementation and 2 questions related to the AXA entities' compliance with the vigilance plan, which can be broken down into the following six (6) themes:\n\n- \u25a0 sustainable procurement : inclusion of sustainability criteria in the RFPs, inclusion of sustainability clause in contracts, signature of the Buyer Code of Ethics by procurement associates, implementation of sustainability awareness sessions in local\n\nprocurement teams, sustainability evaluation of suppliers by third party;\n\n- \u25a0 employee human rights : LGBT+ inclusive workplace, inclusion of employees with a temporary or permanent disability, implementation of a social dialogue;\n- \u25a0 whistleblowing policy: existence of a local formal policy, communication of this policy, definition of main roles and responsibilities, the coverage of the speak-up procedure and its accessibility for employees and external stakeholders;\n- \u25a0 safety, health, and security of employees : processes to identify risks, proactive and reactive measures, performance measurement;\n- \u25a0 personal data protection : application of the Binding Corporate Rules; and\n- \u25a0 environment and human rights as an insurer and as an investor : compliance with the Group guidelines.\n\nFo llowing the self-assessment conducted in 2023, gaps were identified, and the relevant entities shall implement improvement action plans, including the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the enhancement of the onboarding of procurement associates with sustainability awareness sessions and their signature of the Buyer Code of Ethics;\n- \u25a0 the strengthening of procurement process with respect to sourcing (inclusion of sustainability criteria in the RFP), contracting (the inclusion of the sustainability clause  in\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Please refer to Section 1.1 'The AXA Group - Key figures - Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) ratings' for further details about ratings. Furthermore, the AXA Group received a 'Gold' score in its latest EcoVadis evaluation.\n\n## AS A BUSINESS PARTNER\n\nIntegrating Group Sustainability strategy and commitments into its management of its key suppliers and sub-contractors is an on-going activity for AXA Group. This alignment means that AXA Group integrates sustainability considerations to select and monitor its suppliers. This approach is articulated around two axes: (i) responsible persons & processes; and (ii) responsible suppliers.\n\nAll AXA entities are required to report on General Expenses and IT Procurement, on an annual basis, to Group Procurement\n\nteams, with indicators detailing their alignment with AXA Group standards on sustainability on these two axes. This framework allows AXA Group to monitor the e/ff ective implementation of the Group Sustainability strategy with respect to our own operations.\n\nThe results of this reporting on General Expenses and IT contracts in respect of the 27 AXA entities that completed this survey for 2023 are set out below:\n\n## \u25a0 responsible people & processes:\n\n- \u00b7 the AXA Group personnel working in a procurement department must sign the Code of Ethics, which promotes fairness and neutrality, confidentiality, and transparency of sourcing decisions.  In 2022 and 2023, more than 90% (1) of procurement associates signed the Buyer Code of Ethics .\n- \u00b7 the personnel is also trained to the AXA Group's Sustainability strategy and its Sustainable Procurement policy through awareness sessions given by the network of Sustainable Procurement personnel identified in our various entities. In 2022 and 2023 more than 80% (1) of procurement associates attended the sustainability awareness session.\n\n## \u25a0 r esponsible  suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 the AXA Group requires a sustainable development clause, to be included in  IT and General Expenses contracts signed with suppliers and sub-contractors. That clause provides a number of obligations, including (i) respect by supplier of human rights, fundamental freedoms, safety, health, and environmental protection, (ii) authorization for AXA Group to carry out audits to verify that its supplier complies with its obligations, in particular under the sustainability clauses and (iii) the possibility for AXA Group to terminate a contract in the event of a breach of those obligations. More than 90% (1) of the procurement contracts entered or renewed in 2022 and 2023 included this sustainability clause.\n- \u00b7 since 2021 an ESG criteria grid has been shared across the Procurement teams and continues to be integrated into the Group's calls for tenders in respect of  IT and General Expenses contracts. Criteria may vary depending on purchasing categories . As an example, they may involve the EcoVadis rating, the carbon emissions of suppliers' and sub-contractors' products and services, or their responsible procurement policy. More than 75% (1) of RFP launched in 2022 and 2023 contained the Sustainability criteria .\n- \u00b7 the AXA Group implemented an assessment of the extrafinancial risks of  IT and General Expenses suppliers, identified thanks to an internal Risk Matrix by procurement category (please refer to Section 'Vigilance Plan - Risk mapping to identify, analyze and prioritize risks - Mapping of risks in AXA's supply chain ' above). More than 70% (1) of the suppliers evaluated in 2022 and 2023 shared a Bronze or higher EcoVadis scoring.\n\nI\n\nI",

All these best practices applied locally are shared by the Sustainable Procurement community in order to promote a wider deployment.\n\nSince 2018, the AXA Group uses a dedicated Vendor Risk program to reinforce its operational control and Risk Management of third parties.

The guidelines comprehensively integrate the Group sustainability restriction list into the AXA Group's P&C underwriting governance framework, ensuring that P&C activity is conducted in accordance with the AXA Group's Sustainability objectives and values in all respects, save where to do so would be a breach of legal and regulatory requirements in any applicable jurisdiction . They set out the risks and types of customer which AXA group entities are prohibited from or restricted in underwriting, as well as applicable assessment criteria, while outlining an escalation framework for issues and sensitive cases encountered in the underwriting process which might otherwise result in a breach of the AXA Group's sustainability commitments. The guidelines are reviewed regularly in tandem with the Group sustainability restriction list and the Group Sustainability Standards.\n\n## In respect of investments\n\nThe Group Sustainability Standards apply by reference to the responsible investment restriction list, which is regularly updated by the Group Investment & ALM teams and disseminated by the Financial Risk Management teams to all local investment teams and their respective CFOs/CEOs.\n\n- \u25a0 These restrictions apply to all investments made by local entities as principle and also, with respect to General Account assets and Unit-Linked assets, notwithstanding the asset manager.\n\nIn this context, CEOs/CFOs must ensure timely escalation of any breaches of the Group Sustainability Standards to the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer and Group Sustainability O/ff icer as soon as it becomes known.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Under the Climate Delegated Act Non-Life insurance activities through the underwriting of climate-related perils can indeed qualify as contributing substantially to climate change adaptation.\n\nAXA shall also separately disclose the KPI related to investments by insurance or reinsurance undertakings , which present the weighted average of those investments that are directed at funding or are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. Such indicators measure the extent to which investments by financial undertakings, such as insurers and reinsurers, contribute to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment.\n\n(v)\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of June 27, 2023 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing additional technical\n\nscreening criteria for determining the conditions under which certain economic activities qualify as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation\n\nor climate change adaptation and for determining whether those activities cause no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (\n\nthe\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## METHODOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTo assist companies, the European Commission regularly publishes Taxonomy FAQs and notices that aim at further clarifying the disclosure requirements under the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Disclosures Delegated Act. AXA acknowledges the interpretative and implementation guidance provided by the EU Commission, notably the specific guidance to financial undertakings in the dra/f\\_t  Third Commission Notice released on December 21, 2023.\n\nGiven that the legal framework for the EU Taxonomy reporting is new and still in the process of development; the requirements are subject to uncertainty in interpretation and the underlying data that are necessary to produce the KPI are not immediately available, as explained below. Against this background, AXA has opted for a prudent approach and will progressively enhance the completeness and quality of the Taxonomy reporting.\n\nFurthermore, the information included in the section on EU Taxonomy Disclosures provides only a partial view of how AXA contributes to climate-change adaptation and should be read in conjunction with all other information provided in Section 4 that gives further examples of such contribution.\n\nConsidering that this is the first year of reporting for financial undertakings, which start reporting KPIs based on the criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation for an economic activity to qualify as 'environmentally sustainable', AXA agrees with the observations and expectations of the European Commission that the robustness and accuracy of KPIs disclosed by undertakings, including financial undertakings, will improve gradually with the uptake of the EU Taxonomy by the relevant undertakings, notably in respect of the flow of information and data from the financial and non-financial counterparties that they invest in.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAXA took note of the guidance dra/f\\_t ed by the European Commission with respect to the information to be included in the contextual disclosures, particularly in connection with the requirement to disclose a consolidated group-level KPI on Taxonomy-aligned activities for parent undertakings of groups that have several financial activities and, in such situations, the requirement to provide subsidiary-level KPIs on Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nThese additional clarifications call for a reassessment of the methods and reported KPIs, with significant operational implications. For example, the publication of subsidiary-level KPI on Taxonomy-aligned activities could not be fully taken into account in the statement published for the purpose of this financial year ended December 31, 2023, and should be disclosed for the purpose of subsequent reporting years.\n\nIn addition, the method for calculating a consolidated grouplevel KPI on Taxonomy-aligned activities by computing the KPIs applicable to AXA ( i.e., the KPI related to investments by insurance or reinsurance undertakings, the KPI related to underwriting activities and possible the KPIs from other economic activities) is not detailed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation nor in the supplementing Commission Delegated Regulations, and will have to be determined in light of the information recently published by the European Commission in the dra/f\\_t  Third Commission Notice.\n\nFinally, the KPIs applicable to AXA presented in this section, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Commission Delegated Regulations, for the purpose of the financial year ended December 31, 2023, were based on financial data available as of December 31, 2023. Considering that this is the first year of reporting for AXA with respect to such KPIs, figures and comparable information for 2022 could not be provided.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

(2)\n\nIn this regard, AXA Group has identified three lines of business composed of insurance or reinsurance products generally including coverage of risks related to climate-related perils:\n\n(i) motor insurance (other than third party liability insurance);\n\n(ii) marine, Aviation and Transport insurance; and (iii) fire and other property damage insurance.\n\nOn other potentially eligible lines of business ( i.e ., medical expense insurance, income protection insurance, workers' compensation insurance, motor vehicle liability insurance and assistance), only the share of the gross written premiums covering climate-related perils in products for which such cover is explicitly mentioned in the insurance policy terms have been considered as Taxonomyeligible.\n\nThe analysis has been done on direct lines of business, and reinsurance assumed.\n\nThe calculation of the share of premium covering climate related event was based on pricing tool or, if not available, using claim database.\n\nThe share of gross written premiums covering climate related events reported in those three lines of business have been recognized as Taxonomy-eligible, excluding thus premiums of products for which climate-related perils are explicitly excluded from the insurance policy terms or for which climate-related perils cannot trigger any claims.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "To determine the amount of premiums related to non-Life insurance and reinsurance underwriting Taxonomy-aligned activities, AXA Group analyzed the Taxonomy-eligible products and identified those that meet all the TSC for insurance and reinsurance activities related to leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks, product design, innovative insurance coverage solutions, data sharing and high level of service in post-disaster situations.\n\nIn order to comply with the DNSH criteria, the premiums from policies covering extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil fuels or vehicles, property or other assets dedicated to such purposes, were excluded from the Scope of Taxonomyaligned premiums.\n\nIn order to qualify as 'environmentally sustainable' in compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, an economic activity must also comply with the minimum safeguards, laid down in article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. According to the European Commission (1) , the central requirement is the implementation of appropriate procedures to identify, prevent, mitigate or remedy, on an ongoing basis, actual or potential negative impacts related to its operations, value chain and contractual relationships. This ensures that the entity's activities are carried out in compliance with such minimum safeguards.\n\nIn France, the market consensus among French insurance companies is that the loi de vigilance (2) is based, at a high-level, on the principles and standards mentioned in article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. To comply with the loi de vigilance , AXA Group publishes a vigilance plan that covers AXA's activities and subsidiaries controlled directly or indirectly by AXA.\n\nThe AXA Group's Vigilance Plan;can be found at Section 4.6 'Vigilance Plan' of this Annual Report.\n\nRegarding the data sharing criteria, AXA France already shares loss data with the CCR ( Caisse centrale de r\u00e9assurance ), a publicsector reinsurer wholly owned by the French State. In addition, if a public authority or non-profit research organization is carrying out analyses related to natural hazards, AXA Group will make available to them, free of charge, a significant portion of loss data related to climate-related event. Any authority or research organization must submit a written request to AXA Group, specifying the purpose of the research and the scope of the data requested. This request will be studied and, where appropriate, the data will be provided in a granular manner to enable analytical research but aggregated and anonymized, in order to comply with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## Nature and objectives of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nConsidering the requirement to carefully assess the criteria of article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which are required to be met in order for an economic activity to qualify as environmentally sustainable ( i.e. , Taxonomy-aligned economic activity), at this stage, AXA recognizes only 1% of its non-L ife gross written premiums as being Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nFor now, the Taxonomy-aligned share of non-L ife gross premiums only covers the following guarantees underwritten by AXA France and AXA XL:\n\n- \u25a0 insurance policies covering natural catastrophes to cars and homes underwritten by AXA France. The premium is fixed by the legislation, and preventive measures materialized as alert on mobile phone in case of weather warning are provided to policyholders;\n- \u25a0 insurance policies covering commercial property damage underwritten by AXA XL, where pricing and recommendations o/ff  ered to the clients are dependent of the assessment of a loss prevention report analysis which is influenced by the degrees of prevention against climate-related events; and\n- \u25a0 insurance policies covering property portion of cargo underwritten by AXA XL, for which a pricing di/ff erentiation occurs on the cat deductibles located in storage.\n\nNon-Life insurance products covering climate related perils distributed by AXA entities generally contain features that help customers to better adapt to the consequences of climate change, including incentives to prevent its e/ff ects on property and people. However, as they do not strictly meet all the conditions in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable, these products cannot technically be considered as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn 2024, AXA Group is continuing the work undertaken with local underwriting teams to analyze the existing characteristics of all its non-Life insurance products and will adapt them, wherever feasible, so that they correspond exactly to the criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nAXA remains convinced that the non-Life insurance sector has a key role to play in helping its clients to adapt to climate change and will work to ensure that the EU Taxonomy Regulation disclosures adequately reflects ithe Group's contribution to this objective.\n\n## INTEGRATION OF THE EU TAXONOMY IN THE BUSINESS STRATEGY AND PRODUCT DESIGN PROCESS\n\nInsurance products and features are developed at AXA locally at market or entity level.

The latest version of the PAP includes instructions for the consideration of sustainability features in the design of a new insurance product. If an insurance coverage or service delivers a positive impact on the environment by contributing to at least one of the following objectives: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; transition to circular economy; protection of biodiversity loss and pollution prevention, entities should fill in the Insuring the Transition Index Template. The definitions under the EU Taxonomy Regulation are used to define contributions to each objective.\n\nWith regards specifically to features of an insurance product that would meet the Taxonomy alignment criteria, on the climate adaptation dimension only, the PAP Insuring the Transition Index Template enquires as to the availability of risk prevention services within the new product. Such risk prevention services may encompass two dimensions: (i) impact of an insured's\n\nactivity on the environment or climate, and how to reduce any negative impacts, and (ii) the risks to the insured related to the consequences of climate change and advice or encouragement to reduce their vulnerability. The features of the service are described and scored with the relative significance the service has on the adaptation dimension, either minor or significant. The final score will classify whether this new product may be classified as a 'sustainability value added product', 'standard product', or 'not recommended as a sustainable classified product'.\n\nTo further support the development of Taxonomy-aligned products, at group level a transversal network across entities and covering all P&C product lines has been created to support sustainability underwriting objectives. And clear objectives have been set at group and entity (most entities in-Scope) level. This network will facilitate the development and introduction of additional products and/or features which align to the EU Taxonomy insurance product criteria for climate change adaptation.\n\n## INVESTMENTS DIRECTED AT FUNDING TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ACTIVITIES\n\n## Proportion of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking's investments that are directed at funding, or are associated with, Taxonomy-aligned in relation to total investments\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Turnover-based   | Turnover-based   | Capital expenditures-based   | Capital expenditures-based   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (in EUR million, except percentages)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | %                | Amount           | %                            | Amount                       |\n| The weighted average value of all the investments of insurance or  reinsurance undertakings that are directed at funding, or are associated with  Taxonomy-aligned economic activities relative to the value of total assets  covered by the KPI, with following weights for investments in undertakings | 1.0 %            | 3,818            | 1.4%                         | 5,629                        |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | %                | Amount           |                              |                              |\n| Assets covered by the KPI relative to total investments of insurance or  reinsurance undertakings (total AuM).

The Covered Assets thus include exposures to investments in properties, equity securities, debt instruments (excluding sovereign exposures), non-consolidated investments funds, derivatives, loans, cash, and cash equivalents.

In 2023, the Covered Assets represents 74.0% of the total investments.\n\nExposures to central governments, central banks, and supranational issuers, which overall represent 26.0% of total investments, are excluded from the numerator and denominator of the indicator. This exclusion is explained by the absence of a methodology for determining their alignment with the EU Taxonomy.\n\nExposures to undertakings not subject to articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU and derivatives, representing respectively 32.1% and -0.4% of the Covered Assets, cannot be assessed for Taxonomy eligibility purposes to date. Similarly, exposure to non-EU companies, which represent 32.1% of the Covered Assets, cannot be considered in the formal assessment of assets eligible for or aligned with the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, the information required from financial undertakings must be based on actual data published by non-financial or financial undertakings. The use of estimates or approximations is therefore not possible in the context of mandatory reporting.\n\nThis regulatory constraint explains why the information above only presents the share of investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities under the first two environmental objectives set forth in article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ( i.e. , climate mitigation and climate adaptation). The share of exposures to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities under the four environmental objectives set forth in article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ( i.e. , sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) cannot be presented due to the unavailability of the underlying data. Indeed, as the Environmental Delegated Act was only published in November 2023, non-financial companies were not in a position to establish and publish their indicators for the purpose of such objectives in their management reports at the end of December 2022. As a result, no published information was available for collection directly or indirectly by financial companies in 2023. In the absence of such data, AXA is, in turn, unable this year to produce the KPI relating to investments in respect of these four new objectives (for both eligibility and alignment).\n\nBy default, the fair value of the assets was used to calculate the various indicators.\n\nBased exclusively on data published by companies subject to the reporting requirements under the EU Taxonomy Regulation and collected through an ESG data provider, AXA has identified 3.8 billion investments exposed to Taxonomy-aligned activities, representing 1.0% of the Covered Assets , and 44.5 billion other assets exposed to eligible activities but not Taxonomy-aligned, representing 11.2% of the Covered Assets. These assets correspond\n\nI\n\nI\n\nmainly to debt or equity instruments in European non-financial companies held directly by AXA.\n\nThe available data has nevertheless made it possible to calculate a relatively insignificant amount of aligned investment in companies identified as financial. They correspond to real estate investment trusts (REITs) and financial subsidiaries of European non-financial entities that published their first alignment ratio in 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the list of economic activities eligible to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, investments in real estate properties have been recognized as Taxonomy-eligible based on actual information, representing 10.1% of the Covered Assets.\n\nA review is underway to determine their alignment with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, but the results at this stage are insu/ff icient to classify the assets reliably. It has been decided not to declare any alignment to date for this asset class. The aim is to define a framework over the course of 2024 to assess the shortcomings in terms of data collection, given the level of detail expected, and to be able to accurately measure the alignment of these properties.\n\nExposures to Taxonomy non-eligible activities represent 87.9% ovf the Covered Assets. It includes exposures to cash and loans, but also the remaining assets for which Taxonomy eligibility could not be assessed, i.e. , debts and equity instruments for which actual Taxonomy information is not yet available from AXA Group's external ESG data provider, as well as exposures through investment funds for which the information by issuer is not known. AXA is currently organizing a more granular analysis of the funds' portfolios to be in a position to determine the alignment of indirectly held assets.\n\nMortgage loans, which by nature are deemed Taxonomy-eligible, have been conservatively excluded from the KPIs, as they essentially come from the AXA Group's banking activities and not from its insurance activities in line with dra/f\\_t  Third Commission Notice. As these exposures are not significant in terms of value, this exclusion is not likely to significantly a/ff ect the KPI.\n\n## Integration of the EU Taxonomy in the business strategy, product design process and engagement with counterparties\n\nAXA has not at this stage made any global commitment regarding Taxonomy alignment but has begun to set alignment targets at the level of a few products, with low alignment expectations, mainly for green bond strategies. The expected improvements in terms of understanding of the regulatory framework, data availability and quality of information will eventually enable AXA to refine and raise its ambitions regarding the proportion of its investments in economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy.\n\nAXA will then be able to integrate this dimension into its shareholder engagement, at least for undertakings that fall within the Scope of the European Taxonomy Regulation.",

However, in the interests of readability, template 2 is not presented given the redundancy of the information set out in the first six rows of the table showing the Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and complying with template 3. Furthermore, as the six economic activities covered in this section are by definition recognized as Taxonomy-eligible, no Taxonomy non-eligible amounts are attributable to them and the table corresponding to model 5 would not provide any additional information. It was intentionally decided not to disclose it.\n\nIn below tables, it should be noted that, in some instances, the exposure to economic activities that have been reported as either Taxonomy-aligned or Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomyaligned, could not be allocated to either of the two climate change objectives, which explains that the amounts reported in the total columns do not systematically reconcile with the sum of the amounts for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. These di/ff erences are not significant, in our view.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

For more details on the ESG risks assessment methodology, please refer to Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy - Sustainability risk assessment'.\n\n## SCOPE OF SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\nFor the perimeters defined below, indicators are fully consolidated, unless otherwise indicated:\n\n## Scope of social indicators\n\nThe social data provided in Section 4.2 'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report are collected from entities in which AXA Group holds, directly or indirectly, management control, as of December 31, 2023. It includes all companies that are fully consolidated for financial reporting, representing a total of 108,357 Full Time Employees (FTEs) (1) .\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPercentage of employees trained and certified (security, data protection and cybersecurity training): share of salaried employees trained and certified during the year on the topic of security (including physical security, health & safety, operational resilience & information security), data protection and cybersecurity.\n\nPercentage of the Group Tax footprint covered in the Tax transparency report published during the year (relating to N-1): share of the Group Tax footprint covered in the Tax transparency report published in 2023 (relating to 2022). This Tax footprint corresponds to the detail of the various taxes paid (direct and indirect) by geography where the AXA Group operates.\n\nPercentage of procurement contracts entered or renewed with the sustainability clause: share of procurement contracts entered or renewed with the mandatory sustainability clause which includes, in particular, complying with the principles of the ILO (prohibiting the use of child/forced labor, promoting employee health & safety and freedom of expression, and nondiscrimination).\n\n## Scope of environmental indicators\n\nEnvironmental reporting's Scope is based on the same Scope as Social reporting but AXA Group's entities of less than 250 FTEs and AXA Group's sites with less than 50 FTEs are not included in the data collection process. These entities and sites are considered using an extrapolation process.\n\nIn 2023, the environmental indicators regarding activities concerning AXA Group's sites (energy, water, paper, waste) were collected for 97,302 FTEs working in AXA's group sites and were then extrapolated continent by continent, to cover all 121,354 FTEs (salaried workforce with open-ended and fix-term contracts, contingent labour and trainees, interns and apprentices - average annual personnel) working at AXA Group in 2023 according to the social reporting.\n\nThe environmental indicators regarding business travel and car fleet were collected for 100,062 FTEs working in AXA's group entities and were then extrapolated continent by continent to cover the 108,357 FTEs of salaried workforce (open-ended and fix-term contracts - average annual personnel) working at AXA Group in 2023 according to the social reporting.\n\nThe environmental indicators regarding employee commuting were collected for 16,940 FTEs working in 31 Group entities and were then extrapolated continent by continent, to cover all 121,354 FTEs (salaried workforce with open-ended and fixterm contracts, contingent labour and trainees, interns and",

The other indicators related to IT were collected from 22 entities within AXA Group.\n\n## Scope of societal indicators\n\nIn 2023, AXA's entities contributing to the Community Investment Survey, as described in Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report, represent 105,353 FTEs working on AXA sites, meaning a coverage rate of 96.4%.\n\n## PERIOD\n\nThe indicators cover the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, unless mentioned otherwise. To facilitate collection and processing, some data may be collected early in the year. The data for any remaining months (maximum 6 months) is then estimated in accordance with the Group's defined methodology.\n\n## DATA REPORTING\n\n## Social data reporting\n\nThe social data provided in Section 4.2 'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report are collected through a reporting process defined by procedures associated with a list of indicators shared with all entities of the AXA Group. This process is updated and communicated to each entity on a yearly basis. Social data are provided by local correspondents using an IT tool dedicated to the social data reporting process. Consistency checks and quality controls are carried out before and during the data collection process, as well as evaluations by an independent third party on some legal entities and the overall process. A validation process of this reporting is also performed locally. There is no estimation or extrapolation made on data provided. Regarding data published in ratios and percentages, numerator and denominator are realigned for each calculation to exclude entities with empty data points.\n\n## Environmental data reporting\n\nEnvironmental data has been collected since 2002, through a dedicated reporting tool filled out by entities in the scope of reporting (see scope of environmental indicators above).\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.7 TRANSVERSAL INFORMATION\n\nThe reporting procedure includes guidelines for reporting and controlling, and calculation rules. AXA Group monitors its environmental footprint reduction towards its targets. The reporting procedure is updated annually, and contributors are trained each year. For each site, contributors specify whether the data has been measured or estimated based on the calculation rules defined in the Group's reporting procedures.  Data reported by entities are validated locally by the entity CFOs, except data related to IT and data centers that are validated by each entity CIOs.\n\nData needed for employee commuting calculation is collected via a dedicated questionnaire available for AXA's employees in the reporting scope (see 'Scope of environmental indicators' above).\n\nFor more information, please refer to Section 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity loss - AXA as a company: climate change and biodiversity loss' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Societal data collection\n\nSocietal engagement data which is presented in Section 4.4 'Inclusive insurer - Corporate philanthropy and engagement' of this Annual Report is collected through a dedicated reporting tool with specific definitions for engagement practices. The number of unique volunteers is an estimate based on local entity knowledge of volunteering activities.\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nReporting on certain indicators may have limitations due to circumstances sometimes outside of our control such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the absence of nationally and/or internationally recognized definitions, concerning the di/ff erent categories of employment contracts;\n- \u25a0 headcount accounting may di/ff er from one entity to another depending on local management rules and the availability of data (particularly with regard to long-term absences);\n- \u25a0 the necessary estimates, the representativeness of the measurements made, or the limited availability of external data required for calculations as the required annual update of emission factors;\n- \u25a0 the practical procedures for collecting and entering this information;\n- \u25a0 lack of standardization of methodologies, resulting in incomparable data year-on-year ( e.g., Warming Potential, CVaR); and\n- \u25a0 delays from third-party data providers, notably in respect of information relating to the carbon footprint of investee companies in the context of measuring our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Any of these risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline materially or cause our actual results to di/ff er materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\n\nIn presenting the risks set forth here, Management has identified the primary categories of risk and the most material risks based on Management's assessment of their materiality and specificity to the AXA Group. Management believes that these are the significant risks to which the AXA Group is exposed as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF and this assessment was based on the perceived likelihood that such risks would materialize and the expected magnitude of their negative impact on the Group. As more fully described below, the primary categories of risk include:\n\n- \u25a0 market-related risks;\n- \u25a0 credit- and liquidity-related risks;\n- \u25a0 insurance and reinsurance pricing and underwriting-related risks;\n- \u25a0 operational risks;\n- \u25a0 regulatory and litigation-related risks; and\n- \u25a0 risks related to the ownership of the Company's shares.\n\nThe foregoing categories of risks, and specific risks within these categories, are increasingly interconnected. For example, the risks related to climate change, as described further below, may a/ff ect not only our claims experience through increased\n\nI\n\nI\n\nnatural catastrophe frequency and severity, but may also create increased legal, regulatory and compliance risk. New information, events or circumstances may change Management's assessment of the risks that the Group faces. In particular, Management's assessment may be impacted by the most significant risks identified in AXA's Future Risks Report, including climate change, cyber security risks, geopolitical instability, risks related to artificial intelligence and big data, and energy risks. The risks identified in this Annual Report (which are presented below in order of materiality based on Management's assessment) are not the only risks the Group faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, not specific to the Group or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely a/ff  ect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nManagement devotes very substantial resources to Risk Management on an ongoing basis, but the Group's Risk Management activities, like all control systems, are subject to inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute protection from the risks described in this Part 5 or the losses that may result in the event they materialize.\n\nWhere such risks have had quantifiable and material financial impacts on the Group and/or resulted in material contingent liabilities, those financial impacts and/or contingent liabilities are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with applicable accounting principles. The Company's Risk Management processes, procedures and controls are described in Section  5.2  'Internal control and Risk Management'  of this Annual Report, which should be read in conjunction with this Section 5.1. You should also refer to Section 5.3 et seq . of this Annual Report for quantitative information on the material risks to which the Group is exposed.",

These factors include:\n\n- \u25a0 adverse geopolitical events (including acts of terrorism or military conflicts) and rising geopolitical tensions in various regions and countries (such as the Middle East, Russia, Ukraine, China, Iran, T\u00fcrkiye, Latin America, Libya, Syria, Iraq, North Korea and Afghanistan), which may result in spikes in asset prices (such as oil) and create inflationary pressures, or otherwise destabilize financial markets;\n- \u25a0 political polarization and volatility in countries or regions whose stability is key to well-functioning financial markets;\n- \u25a0 concerns over a persistent slowdown or reversal in economic growth and levels of consumer confidence generally;\n- \u25a0 current market conditions, including those relating to asset valuations and volatility of asset prices, that may lead to an abrupt and significant repricing in financial markets, disruptions in the global supply chain and elevated and volatile energy and raw material prices;\n- \u25a0 actual or expected volatility in interest rates;\n- \u25a0 the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the Euro;\n- \u25a0 the availability and cost of credit;\n- \u25a0 the stability and solvency of certain financial institutions and other companies, including related systemic credit risk concerns and/or central bank intervention in financial markets;\n- \u25a0 inflation or deflation in certain markets;\n- \u25a0 a downturn in the global real estate market or in specific significant markets (such as the recent downturn in China);\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\n- \u25a0 credit and valuation risks for private assets, created or amplified by high inflation, tight labor markets and more restrictive credit conditions, among other factors; and\n- \u25a0 the continuation or escalation of trade-related disputes between China and the United States and European Union, related disruption to global supply and value chains, the prospect, and potential impact, of any further 'de-coupling' of China from the global economy, and China-related geopolitical tensions or other new or rising trade tensions.\n\nWe have a large investment portfolio and our investment income-which may be impacted by one or more of the foregoing conditions-is an important part of our profitability. In addition, our sales of insurance and Asset Management products (as well as the level of product surrenders and lapses) depend on the performance of financial markets and customer behavior and confidence, as well as other related factors. Our ability to make a profit on insurance and investment products depends in part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under those products. In addition, certain types of insurance and investment products that we o/ff er expose us to risks associated with financial market fluctuations. These products include certain interest-sensitive or variable products, such as guaranteed or variable annuities, which have crediting or other guaranteed rates that are not necessarily related to prevailing market interest rates or investment returns on underlying assets. Although we use hedging techniques to help mitigate our exposure under certain of these guaranteed benefits, we cannot e/ff ectively hedge against all such risks or volatility in the financial markets, which may still adversely impact us. Furthermore, financial market conditions such as those described above could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our solvency.\n\nMo re generally, the economic environment in which we do business may result in less demand for our financial and insurance products. Significant levels of lapses, surrenders or non-payment of policies or funds due to higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending could all have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFor additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency II ratio to capital market conditions, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com) (1) .\n\n5",

The more volatile these fluctuations are, the more unpredictable our investment valuations and earnings will be.\n\nDuring periods of increasing interest rates, the fair value of certain of our fixed-income investments may decrease, which could negatively impact our shareholders' equity and Solvency II ratio, or could impact our net income in the event our fixedincome assets were sold. Furthermore, surrenders and lapses of life insurance policies and fixed annuity contracts may accelerate as policyholders seek higher returns, which may cause us to liquidate fixed maturity investments in order to obtain liquidity to satisfy such obligations. This, in turn, may result in liquidity strains and realized investment losses. Lower assets under management would reduce the management fees of our Asset Management business. In addition, we may be required, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities, debt, and bank facilities. We may also face an increase in the cost of our repurchase agreements and the cost of derivative hedging transactions, which may increase our interest expenses.\n\nConversely, during periods of declining or low interest rates, our net investment income and the profitability of our Life & Health business may be negatively impacted. Earnings from any fixed income investments entered into in a low-rate environment compared to the rates we pay to policyholders and annuity contract owners may result in reduced profitability. In-force life insurance and annuity products may become comparatively more attractive to customers in a declining interest-rate environment, resulting in an increase in our liabilities (in particular in relation to flexible-premium products), asset-liability duration mismatches (as more policies and contracts remain in-force from year-to-year) and an increase in provisions for guarantees included in life insurance and annuity products. In addition, an extended period of low interest rates may increase the regulatory capital and amount of assets we must maintain to cover such provisions, which could have an adverse impact on our Solvency II ratio.\n\nOur exposure to changes in credit spreads primarily relates to the impact of such changes on market prices and cash flow variability. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of the fixed-income securities we hold (including credit derivatives where we assume credit exposure) and increase our\n\ninvestment income associated with purchases of new fixedincome securities in our investment portfolios. Conversely, credit spread tightening will generally increase the value of fixedincome securities we hold and reduce our investment income associated with new purchases of fixed-income securities in our investment portfolios.\n\nAlthough we take measures, including hedging through derivative instruments, to manage interest rate and credit spread risk, we may not be able to mitigate the e/ff ect of any ongoing volatility in interest rates or credit spreads, which could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our solvency position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized gains and loss positions. For additional information on the sensitivity of our Eligible Own Funds (EOF) and Solvency II ratio to changes in interest rates and corporate bond spreads, please refer to Section 6.6 - Note 4.2  'Market risks (including sensitivity analysis)'  of this Annual Report and the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com) (1) .\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly a/ff  ect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and solvency\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of our business and the fact that significant subsidiaries of the Group are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan and Hong Kong, we are exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. A significant portion of our shareholdings and investments, revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the Euro, while our Consolidated Financial Statements are published in Euros. Likewise, the portion of our debt and other obligations (including certain reinsurance treaties and retrocession agreements to which we are a party) denominated in currencies other than the Euro is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nEquity of Group entities is expressed primarily in the Euro, US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollar. Fluctuations in Euro exchange rates, have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on the Shareholders' equity Group share and Underlying earnings Group share. We have not implemented a policy of fully hedging the changes in the value of the equity of our subsidiaries with equity denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nSimilarly, fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on the Group's net income (as a result of the translation of foreign currency transactions, the settlement of foreign currency balances and discrepancies between foreign currency liabilities and assets), cash flows, gearing ratio and solvency. In addition, the currency hedges we use to manage foreign exchange rate risk\n\nI\n\nI",

For more information about the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates and the main hedging positions of AXA SA with respect to foreign currencies, please refer to Section 5.3 'Market risks' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Inflation or deflation in our principal markets would have multiple impacts on the Group and may negatively a/ff  ect our business, solvency position and results of operations\n\nWe are exposed to inflation risk in certain of our principal markets, (i) through our holdings of fixed interest rate and other instruments, and (ii) as a result of the potential for claim payments and expenses to rise faster than anticipated in our reserving and pricing assumptions.\n\nThe Group's assets are exposed to increases in inflation, which was pronounced in 2023. Elevated inflation could result in increases in interest rates by central banks and lead to a decrease in the market value of bonds held in our investment portfolio, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on the profitability of our investment portfolio and on our revenues. Increases in inflation could also have an impact on the creditworthiness of bond issuers and could result in an increase in credit spreads (see 'Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely a/ff ect the value of our investments, as well as our business, results of operations, solvency, liquidity and financial condition ' above). Depending on the relevant macroeconomic context, increases in inflation could also have a negative impact on risk premiums and share prices, which could result in a decline in the market value of the Group's equity portfolio.\n\nOur Property & Casualty business, in particular, is impacted by inflation in the costs of claims, the size of damage awards resulting from litigation, labor costs, cost of energy and raw materials, medical costs, new/replacement parts and materials, construction costs and/or inflation due in particular to disruptions in the global supply chain. The impact of inflation on claim costs could be more pronounced for certain of our claims that are indexed to inflation and those Property & Casualty lines of business that are considered 'long tail', such as general Liability, Workers' Compensation and professional Liability, and other specialty lines of our AXA XL business, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. In addition, lags in re-pricing in our Property & Casualty business, when combined with inflation, could reduce our profitability, and pricing measures to counteract inflation may be refused by our customers. Inflation driven in the short term by supply chain disruptions and shortages a/ff ecting raw materials and goods may negatively impact the results of our operations, especially for our short-tail lines of business. Changes\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nin the level of inflation could also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of claims reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business, which could have a significant adverse e/ff  ect on our solvency, results, financial position or cash flows.\n\nA significant decline in the market value of the Group's asset portfolio and an increase in the costs of claims could also lead to a decrease in the Group's shareholders' equity.\n\nW e are also exposed to deflation risk, which materialized in the Eurozone in prior periods. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of certain invested assets, and may negatively impact customer behavior or otherwise negatively a/ff  ect our business and results of operations.\n\n## Developments adversely impacting the recoverability of goodwill, amortization of intangibles or deferred tax assets could materially a/ff  ect our results of operations and financial position\n\nThe valuation of our intangible assets (such as goodwill) is largely based on subjective and complex judgments concerning items that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions and judgements were to change adversely, this could reduce the value of our assets and in turn could reduce shareholders' equity.\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the performance of each entity concerned as well as relevant tax laws, regulatory requirements and accounting methods. The occurrence of certain events such as actual operating earnings being lower than projections, losses continuing over a longer period than originally anticipated, or changes in tax laws, regulatory requirements, or accounting methods could lead to writing down some of the deferred tax assets for accounting or regulatory purposes.\n\n## Adverse experience relative to the methodologies, estimates and assumptions used by Management in valuing investments and determining allowances and impairments may adversely a/ff  ect our results of operations\n\nCertain of our invested assets, for which there is no active trading market or other observable market data, are valued using models and methodologies that involve estimates, assumptions and significant Management judgment. During periods of market disruption, a larger portion of our invested assets may be valued using these models and methodologies as a result of less frequent trading or less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes. Our valuations on this basis may not represent the price for which a security may ultimately be sold\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

These risks may cause the market and prices for certain investments with a high carbon footprint (also known as 'stranded assets') to decrease over time.  The choice of models, methodologies and/or assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value amounts and could have a material adverse e/ff  ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of the allowances and impairments that we recognize with respect to the invested assets we hold varies by investment type, and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. In considering impairments, Management considers a wide range of factors, including those described in Section  6.6 - Note 1.9.2 'Financial investments '  of this Annual Report, and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the fair value of the invested assets and the prospects for near-term recovery. For certain asset classes, particularly debt instruments, Management's evaluation involves a variety of assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer of the instrument and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments as such evaluations are revised. However, Management may not have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. The need for and timing of any additional impairments and/or allowances may have a material adverse e/ff  ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff  ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital\n\nOver the past years, the capital and credit markets have at times experienced high levels of volatility and disruption which, during certain periods of acute stress, have limited the availability of additional liquidity in the markets and the credit capacity of most issuers, including the AXA Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses (including claims and surrenders), pay dividends, buy back our shares, pay interest on our debts, refinance certain maturing debts, meet collateral or margin calls and cover other liabilities. The availability of additional financing will depend on market conditions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity. It will also depend on customers' or lenders' perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. While Management has put in place a Liquidity Risk Management framework that includes active monitoring of the Group's liquidity position and contingency plans for accessing liquidity, liquidity constraints over a prolonged period may have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\n\nFor information about the contractual maturities of debt instruments held by the Group, please refer to Section  6.6 Note 7.4.3  'Debt instruments and loans by contractual maturity and exposure to interest rate risk '  of this Annual Report.\n\n## Downgrades in our insurer and reinsurer financial strength and credit ratings could adversely impact our competitive position and damage our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties\n\nInsurer and reinsurer financial strength and credit ratings are important factors used by the market and customers in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies and in assessing our claims-paying ability. Rating agencies review their ratings and rating criteria and methodologies on a recurring basis, and they may change or withdraw their ratings at any time, based on relevant factors that may not be entirely within our control. Consequently, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future and no undue reliance should be placed on such ratings, which should not be considered as recommendations to purchase, sell or hold any securities we have issued.\n\nA downgrade or the potential for a downgrade in our ratings could have an adverse effect, including (i) damaging our competitive position, (ii) negatively impacting our ability to underwrite new insurance policies, (iii) increasing the levels of surrenders and termination rates of our in-force policies, (iv) increasing our reinsurance costs, (v) triggering termination provisions or collateral delivery requirements, or requiring us to return unearned premiums to cedants under certain of our reinsurance and retrocessional agreements, (vi) negatively impacting our ability to obtain financing and/or increasing our cost of financing, (vii) harming our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties and/or (viii) adversely a/ff ecting public confidence. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, results of operations, revenues and financial condition.",

We make assumptions about these factors in estimating our risk exposures, determining the pricing of our products, establishing our technical provisions and employee benefits reserves and reporting capital levels and business results. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques ( e.g. , scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting), using both proprietary and third-party models, data analytics and related analyses. Model outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis (including availability, use, accuracy, and relevance of historical, internal and industry data). In addition, they incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about market conditions (such as interest rates, inflation and currency exchange rates), capital requirements, loss\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nWe may also have exposures to such counterparties under insurance policies that we have written, including in respect of director and o/ff icer ('D&O'), surety and similar coverages.

The use of such models can also be a/ff ected by operational risks, including input, data, and human error. Adverse experience relative to such assumptions, in particular in the context of pandemics, major natural and man-made catastrophic events, systemic risks, cyber risks, the use of and reliance on incomplete, inaccurate or incomplete models and data, or inherent product defects may result in an increase in the pricing of our insurance products or the need for us to strengthen our product reserves. This may in turn have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition, or lead to litigation.\n\nIn our businesses and in the Company's function as the main operational internal reinsurer of the Group we establish reserves for claims (reported and unreported) and claims expenses in accordance with industry practices, as well as accounting, actuarial and regulatory requirements. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, actuarial experience with respect to past events, legal liability and other factors. The amount of reserves net of reinsurance is also determined based on assumptions as to the availability of reinsurance/retrocession coverage, the applicability of such coverage to potential losses, including, for example, with respect to our ability to aggregate those losses in accordance with the relevant policy terms as well as the recoverability of any reinsurance receivables. In establishing such reserves, there is furthermore a risk related to discounting, which may turn out to be erroneous or need updating, which may in turn impact the Group's assessments and/or require that they be revised.\n\nWe are exposed to primary insurance risks in our Property & Casualty business cycle, and our earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting the prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for obligations for technical provisions and claims. Natural and man-made catastrophes and major accidents or incidents, among other adverse developments, are inherently unpredictable and may result in actual claims that exceed expected claims, harming our profitability. This uncertainty may be exacerbated by governmental or regulatory pressure to fill protection gaps. Reserve risk, resulting from fluctuations in the timing or amount of claims settlements, or changes in our estimated losses (among other factors), could negatively impact our results of operations. Our actuarial staff's evaluations of loss reserve levels could change with time and loss experience, which would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. During Property & Casualty loss settlement periods,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwhich can last several years for certain of our businesses, new or evolving facts regarding claims and trends may arise, resulting in changes to overall reserves. Changes may also result from application of statistical and actuarial methods, which may require the adjustment of overall reserves upward or downward. For additional information, please refer to the paragraph below 'The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changing weather patterns, diseases and climatic conditions, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows'.\n\nOther factors, such as social inflation (increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards and settlement expectations), as well as mass litigation claims related to exposure to harmful products or substances ( e.g., asbestos, opioids, talc, glyphosate, lead paint, PFAS ), may affect the ultimate costs of claims in our Property & Casualty business in ways that are di/ff icult to assess for reserve estimate purposes and could be material. Our estimates may also be more di/ff icult during times of adverse economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims. Because the establishment of claims reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving numerous estimates and assumptions, ultimately losses may materially exceed our claims reserves and have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations.\n\nAs is the case for our Property & Casualty business, our Life & Health business's earnings depend upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use for pricing our products and determining our liabilities for obligations for technical provisions and claims. In certain cases, product features such as minimum guarantees or options to swap between underlying funds in certain savings products may result in realized losses that are higher than initially anticipated. In particular, assessing the impact of minimum guarantees which are contained within certain of our Life & Health products involve a significant degree of Management judgment.\n\nWhile we use both our own experience and industry data to develop products and to estimate future policy benefits, including information used in pricing the insurance products and establishing the related actuarial liabilities, actual experience may not match these estimates and systemic risks and other risks relating to pandemics or major natural or man-made catastrophe events may result in loss experience that is inconsistent with our pricing and reserve assumptions. Furthermore, while our New Business Value (NBV) and Contractual Service Margin (CSM) calculations are done on a market consistent basis, changes in assumptions used in calculating these measures may have a",

Physical risks relating to extreme and more frequent weather events may also impact the availability of cover at an a/ff ordable level which could impact profitability both through reduced income and reputational impact to the insurance industry.\n\nTransition  risks  could  impact  our  insurance  products, underwriting and the value of our investments. For example, new or more ambitious low-carbon targets imposed by government or investors may create capital and operational consequences for the assets or the companies in which we have invested,\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nreducing the value of those assets or companies. Both the physical and transition risks of climate change increasingly result in liability risks, including potential disputes, claims for compensation and legal proceedings brought against those we insure and potentially directly against AXA, seeking damages for contribution to climate change or for inaccurate or insu/ff icient disclosure around material financial or operational risks. For additional information on regulatory and litigation risks related to climate change, please refer to the paragraph below 'Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters, as well as geopolitical matters, may result in increased litigation and may impact our business and results of operations'.\n\n## The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changing weather patterns, diseases and climatic conditions, could adversely a/ff ect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n\nImpact of catastrophic events. The AXA Group underwrites risks in most regions of the globe (Europe, Africa, North and Latin America, Asia-Pacific) which are all exposed to natural and other man-made catastrophic events described below:\n\nNatural catastrophes include such events as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, freezes, floods, explosions, wildfires, pandemics, and infectious diseases. Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, including as a result of climate change, have increased the unpredictability, severity and frequency of natural disasters and impacted our ability to predict future trends and exposures. Our exposure to natural disasters depends on various factors and is often more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major urban centers, with a high concentration of customers, employees and/or insured property and assets.\n\nOther catastrophic events include man-made disasters resulting from negligent or deliberate human actions, such as ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks, systemic cyber failures, terrorist attacks, military actions, and the destruction or failure of power grid and other core infrastructure ( e.g. , telephony or internet infrastructure) failures, as well as any new significant systemic risks (such as those relating to cyber security).\n\nCatastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in or adversely affect our operations, results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, including as a result of claims\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

We monitor the evolution of these risks closely and generally seek to manage our exposure to them through individual risk selection, modelling and monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulation, purchase of third-party reinsurance and risk transfer transactions to capital markets. In some cases, we may reduce our exposure and/or risk appetites. However, we may not be able to adequately anticipate such catastrophic events, which may a/ff ect multiple geographic areas and lines of business or exceed our initial projections, due to their frequency or severity.\n\nSuch events may furthermore result in (i) the introduction of accounting principles and rules preventing insurers and reinsurers from reserving for catastrophic events until they occur and (ii) legislative, regulatory, or judicial decisions implemented following major catastrophes, which may seek to expand the intended scope of coverage for catastrophe-related claims beyond policy terms, including through policyholder-friendly or otherwise broad interpretations of policy wording or retroactive extension of policy coverage.\n\nWhile we seek to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events through diversification and incremental reinsurance, we have experienced, and could in the future experience, material losses from these types of risks, which may exceed our reinsurance and retrocessional protection (or similar protection a/ff orded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets). Such protection may otherwise be inadequate to protect us against losses, and reinsurance receivables may not be recoverable as expected. For additional information on risks related to our reinsurance coverage, please refer to the paragraph below 'Reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, in particular in the context of cyclical Property & Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses'.\n\n## Our Risk Management programs may be inadequate to protect us against the full extent of the exposure or losses we seek to mitigate and may leave us exposed to unidentified, unanticipated or incorrectly quantified risks that could result in significant losses\n\nWe employ a range of Risk Management strategies, including reinsurance for our own account and capital markets solutions (such as catastrophe bonds), in order to avoid or limit losses and liabilities. The failure of, or our inability to adapt, any of our Risk Management strategies could result in significant losses and have\n\nI\n\nI\n\na material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nHedging. We use derivatives (including equity futures, treasury bond futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions, equity options and foreign currency derivatives) to hedge certain, but not all, risks under guarantees provided to our clients or stemming from our assets. In particular, to hedge a significant widening of credit spreads, we use credit swaps to mitigate our exposure to significant deterioration of the credit quality of our asset portfolio. In certain cases, however, we may not be able or may choose not to apply these techniques to hedge our risks as intended or expected for any number of reasons, which may result in higher realized losses and unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle transactions. Such reasons may include: size or liquidity of the derivative markets in question; the financial cost of hedging; or the nature of the risk itself may limit our ability to e/ff ectively hedge. Hedging counterparties may also fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralized.\n\nModeling. The operation of our hedging program is based on models involving numerous estimates and Management judgments, including, among others, volatility and interest rates, and correlation among various market movements. These models or their underlying estimates and assumptions could prove inadequate for certain market environments, especially when financial markets experience high volatility.\n\n## Reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, in particular in the context of cyclical Property & Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses\n\nThe Group's net exposure may increase if we are unable to obtain adequate types and amounts of reinsurance/retrocession, whether as the result of pricing pressure (in particular in the context of a hardening market), limited market capacity, responses to specific major natural catastrophe events, or otherwise. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue. We may also incur unexpected costs as a result of one or more reinsurers' insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts or in an amount equal to the relevant reinsurance recoverables or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of the reinsurance treaties may evolve, which may prevent us from renewing on the same or substantially the same terms or limit our coverage for certain exposures under our policies",

Changes in customer expectations for appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events, including losses incurred by our ceding insurers, reinsurers and retrocessionaires, the hardening of the reinsurance market or other factors a/ff ecting the Property & Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses may have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, there may be uncertainty surrounding reinsurance/ retrocessional coverage for losses. Reinsurance/retrocessional coverage for losses may be more difficult to obtain, as our reinsurers may challenge the applicability of coverage, seek to rely on exclusions or seek to limit our ability to aggregate these losses in accordance with policy terms, any of which may require us to pursue arbitration/litigation and involve significant time and cost to enforce our coverage. The amount of reinsurance recovery available to us in respect of these losses may be adversely impacted as a result.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches of our computer systems, technologies or networks, or those of our third-party providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in damage to our reputation or significant financial losses, and expose us to potential regulatory sanctions\n\nThe increasing frequency and sophistication of ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks directed at major financial institutions and other corporations has made clear the significance of these cyber risks and the operational, financial, and reputational damage that they can potentially inflict. Despite the Group's implementation of a variety of security measures, the Group's data, systems, and technologies, as well as the services we provide or rely on (including mobile and cloud services), have been and may in the future be subject to unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware, and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks, unauthorized tampering, or other security breaches. Like other global financial institutions and companies, the Group has, from time to time, experienced threats to or compromises of its data, systems, and technologies, including phishing, unauthorized access, malware or ransomware attacks, systems failures and disruptions which\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nhave required notification to applicable regulators and clients but have not resulted in material consequences for the Group.\n\nExposure to these threats has widened due to a growing reliance on digital infrastructure, including from extended remote working arrangements put in place across the Group. Management has put in place internal controls and procedures designed to protect client data as well as the Group's assets from hacking or other types of unauthorized intrusions into the Group's computer systems, technologies and networks. However, these controls and procedures may not be su/ff icient, properly implemented, or e/ff ective to prevent all such attempts. This  could result in operational disruption, financial losses, unauthorized access to, tampering or loss of sensitive personal data and/or proprietary information, in addition to the diversion of significant Group resources and attention from its ordinary business activities, including the time and attention of Management, and lead to regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions against us. In addition, our interconnectivity with third-party providers, exchanges, clearing houses, financial institutions and other third parties, could also result in us being adversely impacted by any successful cyber-attack or other security event a/ff ecting any of them.\n\nCyber-attacks and other interruptions or disruptions of our data transmissions, systems and technologies, or those of our third-party providers (including third-party providers deemed critical to our principal activities), or a failure to maintain the availability, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive data residing on such systems or technologies, or transmitted through these networks, could potentially result in financial loss, impairment to our liquidity, a disruption of our businesses, a deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation, any of which could materially adversely a/ff ect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nFor additional information on the risks relating to the protection of personal data, please refer to the paragraph below 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business'.\n\nIn recent years, these cyber-security risks have led to an increased regulatory focus on risks of security breaches stemming from the growing reliance of the financial sector on information and communication technology. For further information on the relevant regulatory frameworks, please refer to 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)' and 'Financial Data Acess (FIDA)' in Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision - Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This strategic plan is further described in Section 2.6  'Outlook' of this Annual Report. Our strategic initiatives may not be successful, or the process of achieving their implementation may cause material disruption to our business operations, management, personnel, brand and reputation.\n\nThe 2024-2026 Strategic Plan strategic plan is based on a number of assumptions, covering, inter alia, the macroeconomic environment and the development of the Group's activities. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques and forecasts regarding several factors ( e.g., interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, claims expenses, gross domestic product). As a result, the financial targets we intend to achieve as part of the 2024-2026 Strategic Plan and any subsequent strategic plans may be negatively affected by an adverse experience relative to such assumptions. Any failure to achieve such financial targets could materially impact our results of operations, share price, competitive position and reputation.\n\n## We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, in-force and other transactions to expand, complement, reorganize or reduce the exposure to certain risks of our business, which could adversely a/ff  ect our business, future profitability and growth\n\nExternal growth transactions involve risks that could adversely a/ff ect our operating results, including the substantial amount of Management time that may be diverted from operations to carry out such transactions, and the risk that assumptions or analyses (whether on the part of the Group or its advisers) used in carrying out such transactions could prove erroneous or incomplete, including but not limited those in respect of financial, strategic or other benefits and/or risks. The completion of any such transaction is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals including any financial accommodations required by regulators (the satisfaction of which may require the transfer of certain assets or branches of activity and/or commitments or restrictions a/ff ecting the conduct of our business), our ability to satisfy such terms and conditions, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncould give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. As a result, any such transaction may fail to be completed as contemplated, or at all.\n\nSuch transactions could also result in new debt or equity issuances, financing arrangements, and the incurrence of additional costs, contingent or unforeseen liabilities or risks and impairment and amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets. Such transactions and the failure to mitigate their risks and uncertainties through due diligence and indemnification provisions could materially and adversely a/ff  ect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth. In addition, we may be subject to, or engage in, litigation in connection with or as a result of any such transaction.\n\nFurthermore, we may be exposed from time to time to  certain integration risks from newly acquired companies or joint ventures relating to their IT, operations or employees. Integration risk may result in the loss of key employees and/or customers of the acquired companies and reliance on a transaction counterparty for transition services for an extended period of time. In addition, the transaction party may not provide such transition services in a manner that is acceptable to us. In connection with our joint ventures and our investments in entities that we do not control, we may also be exposed to risks associated with our partners and co-shareholders. Any of these factors may result in additional expenses and delay or prevent the effective integration or realization of the desired benefits of the transaction.\n\nWe have carried out and may carry out in the future divestitures, in-force management transactions, reorganizations of existing businesses and internal reorganizations, which may result in increased regulatory burdens or adverse e/ff ects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Such divestitures and reorganizations, which may take the form of share or asset sales or merger, as well as reinsurance transactions, may not be carried out within the expected timeframe or at all, due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals or other reasons; the anticipated profit and/or positive e/ff ect on our overall risk profile, our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Solvency II ratio (on a Group basis or AXA SA solo basis), or local solvency and capital adequacy requirements, from any such transactions may not be realized; or we may incur a loss on such transactions. We may retain insurance or reinsurance obligations, counterparty credit risk and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture, discontinuation, liquidation, or run-o/ff  of various businesses and may incur other o/ff -balance sheet liabilities that may result in charges to our income statement.\n\nDivestments of equity participations we hold may also be exposed to volatility and other market-related or geopolitical risks, which could impact the carrying value of our remaining",

All of such factors may be exacerbated by economic conditions relating to reinsurance pricing and market capacity. For additional information on the impact of divestitures, acquisitions and other transactions on goodwill, please refer to Section  6.6 - Note 5  'Goodwill'  of this Annual Report.\n\n## We conduct businesses in highly competitive environments with evolving trends that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition\n\nOur competitors include other insurance or reinsurance companies, mutual fund companies, asset management firms, private equity firms, hedge funds, and commercial and investment banks, many of which are regulated di/ff erently from us and o/ff er alternative products or more competitive pricing than we do.\n\nIn particular, the insurance and reinsurance industry may face disruptive competitive challenges from the emergence of new actors, such as financial technology companies, or fintech, and insurance technology companies, or insurtech, which generally benefit from less extensive regulatory requirements (including less strict capital requirements) as well as from data synergies or technological innovation. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels, claims management or underwriting services for certain types of insurance, reinsurance, and securities products, including through the Internet, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Continued consolidation of the insurance and reinsurance sector may also result in increased competition.\n\nOur performance depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Whether we can successfully do so depends on, among other things, the level of compensation and benefits we offer, our reputation as a fair employer and competition from other employers. Changes in working conditions, including changes resulting from the adoption of new technologies that impact the role or experience of our employees, could also adversely affect our recruiting and retention e/ff orts. For additional information on the challenges posed by technological changes, please refer to the paragraph below 'The failure to respond e/ff ectively to various emerging technological changes may a/ff ect our business and profitability'.\n\nThese competitive pressures and considerations around our human capital could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, as well as increased costs, which may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\n## The failure to respond e/ff  ectively to various emerging technological changes may a/ff ect our business and profitability\n\nWe face an ongoing challenge of effectively adapting to a constantly changing technological landscape. If we do not e/ff ectively anticipate the impact on our business of changing technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robot-advisors, connected devices, driverless cars or drones, our ability to successfully operate our business may be impaired. New or evolving technologies could disrupt the demand for our products or services from current customers, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses. These changes could also a/ff  ect our ability to accurately price our products and might significantly a/ff ect our margins in certain lines of business. For example, the advent of driverless cars, connected devices and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile, health, or other Personal lines insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. In addition, the market for coverage for renewable energy infrastructure and for so-called 'cyber risks', including ransomware and other cyber-related risk, or similar emerging threats is a rapidly evolving one, and any failure by us to provide innovative products relative to our competitors or new entrants in the market, or to price those products e/ff ectively and competitively, may result in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn addition, there has been a rapid increase in the nature, volume and availability of data in recent years, as well as tools and innovations for its collection, storage, use and management, which impact us and our industry. These tools and innovations include, among others, artificial intelligence, connected customers, 'big data', 'blockchain', cloud computing, increased mobile Internet access, personalization of genetic data and asymmetric information with respect to genetic testing.  We  are working in particular to expand our use of artificial intelligence to streamline administrative processes, improve the experience for our customers, make e/ff iciency gains and enhance decisionmaking capabilities. As with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence tools o/ff er  significant promise, but also present a number of potential challenges. Data-driven changes may have unanticipated and adverse impacts on our business, for example by changing the nature of insurance underwriting, pricing and claims handling; by allowing customers and competitors to tailor coverage in ways that we do not currently o/ff  er; or by potentially exposing us to increased 'moral hazard' in business lines where we are unable, for regulatory or other reasons, to adjust pricing or coverage to reflect individual risk profiles. We may need to incur additional expenses and e/ff orts in order to ensure that our employees, systems and processes are able to e/ff iciently adapt to and manage such changes as they arise.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

If we are not able to invest, develop and deploy these tools as quickly and e/ff  ectively as our competitors, our competitive position and profitability may be adversely impacted.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of new products or changes to existing products using artificial intelligence tools may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation or claims of violation of contracts to which we are a party. The adoption of new regulations relating to artificial intelligence, including the EU's proposed rules on artificial intelligence (the 'AI Act'), could result in significant future regulatory fines for actual or perceived noncompliance, as well as significant compliance costs. Changes to existing regulations, their interpretation or implementation could hinder our ability to take advantage of opportunities in artificial intelligence, impede our use of artificial intelligence technology and increase the cost of research and development in this area. Adoption of artificial intelligence tools may also have an unpredictable impact on employees and be met with internal resistance and di/ff iculties, disrupting its development or resulting in negative employee perception.\n\nThere is also a significant risk that artificial intelligence technologies could produce inaccurate or misleading content or other discriminatory or unexpected results or behaviors that could harm our reputation, business or customers. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence involves significant technical complexity and requires specialized expertise, and its development and our use of it in our business and operations may have unanticipated impacts on us as an insurance provider. Any disruption or failure in our artificial systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our operations . Any of these factors could adversely a/ff ect our business, financial  condition and results of operations.\n\n## We operate through arrangements with third parties, including delegation of underwriting and claims authority, which exposes us to operational and regulatory risks and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\nWe have entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with third-party service providers for a wide variety of services required in connection with the day-to-day operation of our insurance,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nreinsurance and Asset Management businesses (including policy administration, claims-related services, securities pricing and other services) and our product distribution. Such arrangements expose us to operational and regulatory risks incurred by these third parties, including employee misconduct or negligence, fraud, internal control failure, contract error, disruption to distribution arrangements, ransomware and other forms of cyber-attacks, failures in processing policies and handling claims, and non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, part of our insurance and reinsurance businesses is underwritten by third parties under contractual arrangements, which typically authorize such third parties to bind us to new policies and to renew policies, within the terms of our licenses and subject to various contractual obligations and restrictions. If we do not delegate appropriately to relevant third parties or these third parties do not abide by the terms of our policies or licenses, amend material terms of the policies without our approval, do not price appropriately or fail to reserve relevant assumptions or otherwise breach their contractual obligations to us, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions for breach of outsourcing/licensing requirements and be liable under the policies issued by breaching third parties. Furthermore, we may be exposed to additional risks, in particular due to legislative or regulatory measures or judicial decisions, such as those imposing customer-friendly interpretations of policy wording, which may apply to policies that were bound on our behalf by third parties.\n\nFurthermore, as with other reinsurers, in our reinsurance business we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance treaties and we largely rely on original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. As a result, if ceding companies did not adequately evaluate the risks insured, the premiums ceded to us may not compensate us for the risks we reinsure and the losses we may incur, which may adversely a/ff ect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe carry out certain of our operations through joint ventures and other partnership arrangements with third parties that we do not control. These arrangements expose us, in particular, to the failure of any of our partners to meets its contractual obligations or to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nAny of our contractual arrangements with third parties may expose us to operational, financial, and reputational risk, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also not be fully indemnified for the contractual breaches of our third parties.",

For more information, please refer to Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision - Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements - Solvency II review' of this Annual Report and the paragraph below 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate'.\n\nAny changes to the Solvency II framework resulting in an increase of SCR that insurers and reinsurers are required to hold with respect to insurance policies or insurance-based investment products may require us to take actions to preserve our solvency level and business model, which might in turn have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, relationships with customers, capacity to pay dividends or buy back our shares, as well as our brand and reputation. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of the proposed changes to current requirements, the impacts of which could include additional regulatory costs and operational constraints, as well as changes to our Internal Model, which may significantly and adversely affect our Solvency II ratio and EOF, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nRegulatory restrictions that inhibit our ability to freely move excess capital among our subsidiaries or which otherwise restrict fungibility of the AXA Group's capital resources may, depending on the nature and extent of the restrictions, adversely affect the capital position of our operating insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries, which may have a consequent negative impact on the perception of the AXA's Group financial strength.\n\nAdditional regulatory developments regarding solvency capital requirements may adversely affect our prudential regime as well as increase associated costs.

In addition, supervisory authorities may become more conservative in the interpretation, application and enforcement of relevant regulations, as a result of which they may, for example, impose increased reserving requirements for certain types of insurers and reinsurers or certain types of risks, greater liquidity requirements (including capital conservations measures preventing dividend distributions, share buy-backs or other payments to shareholders), higher discounts/'haircuts' on certain assets or asset classes or more conservative calculation methodologies, or question the calculation of our insurance best estimate liabilities or take other similar measures which may significantly increase regulatory capital requirements. In particular, the ACPR, the French insurance supervisory authority, may impose changes to the Internal Model we use to calculate our SCR or change its view regarding our methodologies and/ or the integration method of some of our entities, which may adversely a/ff ect our Solvency II ratio. For additional information on our Internal Model and Solvency II ratio, please refer to Section 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management - Internal Model' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn the event of a failure by the Group, the Company (which, since 2022, is an ACPR-licensed reinsurer) or any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, insurance supervisory authorities, including the ACPR, have broad authority to exercise various regulatory and administrative powers at an early stage, including limiting or prohibiting certain activities or operations (such as the acceptance of premiums), prohibiting or on the contrary ordering asset or portfolio disposals, restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions or payments, suspending managers and/or putting a company under special oversight . The ACPR also has the authority to use resolution tools, such as the establishment of a bridge institution and/or liability management structure, to ensure the continuity of critical functions for companies that are failing or likely to fail.\n\nA failure of the Company, the Group and/or any of its insurance or reinsurance entities to meet its regulatory capital requirements and/or a deterioration of its/their solvency position(s) may also result in the need for significant amounts of new capital. In addition, in certain cases, the Company may be required to provide guarantees or capital commitments with respect to its insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries, whether at the request of supervisory authorities or certain counterparties, which may be reflected in our financial statements as off-balance sheet commitments. For additional information on the Company's o/ff balance sheet commitments, please refer the table entitled 'O/ff balance sheet commitments'  in Appendix  III  'AXA Parent Company Financial Statements'  of this Annual Report.\n\nAny of the foregoing may have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Company's or the Group's liquidity position, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions could also have adverse effects. Operational risk is part of the business environment in which we operate and we may incur losses from time to time due to these types of risks, as well as impairments to our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation.\n\nIn particular, our business is highly dependent on the e/ff ective operation of our information technology, telecommunications, electronic data, and other operational systems. We rely on these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing applications and claims, providing information and support to customers and distributors, administering complex products, conducting actuarial analyses and keeping financial records. We also use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize significant amounts of sensitive customer, employee and company data and information, including proprietary and confidential information. Some of these systems, in turn, rely on third-party systems. Systems failures or outages or cyber-attacks, or the failure by third-party technology providers to maintain their services or to meet their contractual obligations, could compromise our ability to perform necessary business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our customers and business partners. In the event of a disruption, our systems may be inaccessible, and our employees unable to perform their duties, for an extended period of time.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFor additional information on the risks relating to the protection, processing and transfer of personal data (including customer and employee data), please refer to the paragraph below 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business'.\n\n## We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and shareholder distributions, including dividend payments\n\nOur principal sources of funds are (i) dividends from subsidiaries, (ii) reinsurance premiums paid by certain of the Group's European Property & Casualty carriers to the Company in its function as the main operational internal reinsurer of the Group and (iii) funds that may be raised from time to time through the issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank or other borrowings and other intra-group arrangements. These funds enable us to cover our operating expenses and make shareholder distributions by the Company including dividend payments, among other things.\n\nRegulatory and other legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from all our subsidiaries. In particular, our principal insurance subsidiaries and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends and debt repayments that can be paid to us and our a/ff iliates. Such restrictions may also be strengthened by capital conservation measures implemented by competent EU, national and other supervisory authorities that prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to the Company. Financial covenants in letters of credit and revolving credit facilities of our subsidiaries may also restrict their ability to declare and pay dividends.\n\nIn addition, the quota-share reinsurance treaties in place between the Company and the Group's European Property & Casualty carriers pursuant to which the Company receives reinsurance premiums were subject to regulatory clearance and regulatory clearance may not be granted each time new arrangements are put in place or existing ones are renewed, as the case may be. Changes in applicable regulation or regulatory guidance may also limit the Company's or its subsidiaries' ability to enter into or renew such arrangements.\n\nMoreover, we are classified as an Internationally Active Insurance Group (IAIG) under the Common Framework for the Supervision of IAIGs (the 'ComFrame'), which was developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and will apply to IAIGs, including the AXA Group, and could, in case of adoption of implementing legislation in relevant jurisdictions, result in the imposition of similar or other restrictions on the",

In July 2022, the Company became the AXA Group's internal reinsurer and, as a regulated reinsurer, is subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. Our regulatory environment is evolving rapidly and supervisory authorities around the world are assuming an increasingly active and extended role in interpreting and enforcing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, resulting in significant compliance challenges. We have highlighted below some of the more recent and noteworthy regulatory developments that we anticipate may impact our business in the coming periods; further details regarding these and related regulatory and supervisory matters also appear in Section 7.3 'General Information Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report. The following summarizes recent developments impacting our required levels of capital and surplus; climate change, sustainability and ESG initiatives; initiatives on fair pay and transparency; customer protection matters; anti-money laundering and and related anti-corruption measures; potential developments at Lloyd's; and changes to IFRS .\n\nCapital standards and restrictions on distributions to shareholders . The multiplicity of di/ff erent regulatory regimes, capital standards and reporting requirements resulting from work on new capital standards led by the IAIS, such as the Insurance Capital Standard, and the development by the IAIS of the ComFrame, which will apply to IAIGs, including the Company, as well as potential changes to applicable solvency and capital adequacy requirements, such as the regulatory framework established under the Solvency II Directive, could increase operational complexity, regulatory costs and competition. In this regard, a review of the Solvency II framework by the European\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nCommission is currently ongoing. For more information about the proposed directive amending the Solvency II Directive, please refer to Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision - Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements Solvency II review' of this Annual Report.\n\nPolicy  and  regulatory  initiatives  on  climate  change, sustainability and ESG . Policy and regulatory initiatives and frameworks, including at French, European Union and international levels, regarding climate change and sustainability, create increasing legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. These initiatives and frameworks include: (i) disclosure requirements, such as those resulting from (a) at the French level, article 29 of Law No. 2019-1147 dated November 8, 2019, on energy and climate (the 'Energy-Climate Law' or 'ECL') and (b) in the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'),  Directive  (EU)  2022/2464  (the  'Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive' or 'CSRD'), Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (the 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation' or 'SFDR'); (ii) conduct rules such as those resulting from Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/2358 regarding the integration of sustainability considerations into the prudential, distribution, investment and advisory framework for insurance and reinsurance undertakings, insurance distributors, asset managers and investment firms; (iii) prudential and Risk Management requirements such as those resulting from Solvency II reforms, EIOPA guidance and climate change stress testing exercises (such as the climate stress test exercise conducted by the ACPR, the first results of which were published in May 2021); or (iv) general vigilance and due diligence requirements, such as those resulting from the 2017 French 'Loi de Vigilance' or the proposed EU directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD). For litigation and activism risks related to the foregoing initiatives and frameworks, please refer to the paragraph below 'Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters, as well as geopolitical matters, may result in increased litigation and may impact our business and results of operations'.\n\nFair pay and transparency . In recent years, there have been significant regulatory and legal developments and enforcement actions in the area of fair pay, including at European Union and international levels, aiming at bolstering equal pay protection and fostering living wages. The EU Council and EU Parliament adopted the EU Pay Transparency Directive in 2023 and gave Member States three years to transpose it into national law. This directive strengthens the application of the principle of equal\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Regulatory and legal developments across jurisdictions may increase compliance and enforcement costs primarily driven by enhanced disclosure obligations and burden of proof as well as possible monetary penalties in case of noncompliance.\n\nCustomer protection matters. Our insurance, reinsurance, Asset Management and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services, in particular by enhancing disclosure and transparency requirements, as well as conduct of business and product governance rules, which have also resulted in stricter scrutiny by competent authorities. In the European Union, these initiatives, including Directive (EU) 2016/97 on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'), Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID II') and Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation'), and similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions in which the Group operates. These initiatives, as well as future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), EIOPA, the ACPR, the AMF and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)) and other emerging social and reputational trends, may increase our legal and compliance costs, limit or restrict our ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, all of which may adversely impact our brand or reputation. For further information, please refer to 'Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment' in Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision - Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nAML and other compliance matters . In recent years there has also been a significant increase in legislative and regulatory initiatives and enforcement actions in the areas of financial crime compliance, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML), international trade sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations ( e.g. , the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, French Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 (also known as 'Sapin II')), which have resulted in the need for enhanced controls on transactions. The financial crime compliance programs of financial institutions remain a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, while regulatory measures in this area continue to be further amended, expanded, and strengthened. For instance, in France, Orders No. 2020-1342 of November 4, 2020, and No. 2020-115 of February 12, 2020, imposed enhanced requirements on French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures, and prevent\n\nI\n\nI\n\nand detect acts of corruption and influence-peddling committed in France and abroad. In addition, a regulation establishing a new, EU-wide AML/CFT authority (AMLA) and implementing a sixth AML directive are in the process of being finalized, which could result in enhanced obligations in the future. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions the relevant AML, anti-corruption and sanctions rules may be enforced on an extraterritorial basis, which could expose our operations to additional or conflicting requirements. In addition, increased cooperation among authorities globally may, in the event we become subject to enforcement proceedings, or are otherwise found to be noncompliant in this area, result in more severe sanctions or monetary penalties.\n\nRegulations for underwriting syndicates and related risks . Following the acquisition of XL Group in 2018, we have been managing, through AXA XL Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, a large underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's and, as a result, are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members. In addition, if Lloyd's fails to satisfy the FCA's and the Prudential Regulation Authority's annual solvency test in any given year, Syndicate 2003 could be required to cease or reduce underwriting through Lloyd's. A downgrading of the Lloyd's market could also impair Syndicate 2003's ability to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. In connection with Brexit, the Lloyd's model for writing business in the European Union through Lloyd's Belgian underwriting subsidiary, Lloyd's Insurance Company SA, is under review by local supervisory authorities, which may have an impact on Syndicate 2003's ability to write EU business. As a Lloyd's syndicate providing coverage to US policyholders and covering US risks, we could also be required by US regulators to increase the level of funding required as minimum deposits for the protection of US policyholders. Any Lloyd's-related risks could have an adverse e/ff ect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges to IFRS . Changes to IFRS, as required by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), may significantly impact insurers and other financial institutions, including AXA, that prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with  IFRS.  In  this  respect,  the  Group  has  implemented simultaneously IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which became e/ff ective for annual periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January 1, 2023. For further information on these two standards, please refer to 'Evolution of accounting standards' in Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision - Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.

While Management proactively manages legal and regulatory risks and has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we do business, the potential e/ff ects of a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement (or the potential e/ff  ects of any new regulation or legislation in the future), or any determination we make regarding compliance with conflicting regulations, may have an adverse e/ff ect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure by us to remain in compliance with regulations applicable to us could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact our earnings and reputation. For a description of the regulations and supervision framework applicable to the Group, please refer to Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe may also be adversely a/ff ected by a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement impacting, or regulatory decisions, authorizations or approvals relating to, third parties with which we do business. For instance, certain of our letter of credit facilities for cedants are e/ff ective only if the banks issuing the letters of credit are on the list of banks approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the 'NAIC'). If some or all of the issuing banks under our credit facilities cease to be NAIC approved and we are unable to replace them with NAIC approved banks, our letter of credit facility capacity could be significantly diminished, especially in situations of adverse capital and credit market conditions where the cost of replacement facilities may be significantly increased or prohibitive. Please refer to the paragraph above 'Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital'.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters, as well as geopolitical matters, may result in increased litigation and may impact our business and results of operations\n\nThere are increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders on\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nESG practices and disclosures, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion and workplace conduct. All of this exposes us to new and increasing legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nThe AXA Group is exposed to increased ESG- and climaterelated litigation risk, including claims by shareholders and other stakeholders for 'greenwashing' actions. Such claims are part of a broader risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny if we are perceived to inadequately disclose or mislead stakeholders in respect of our climate strategy, targets and impacts. This litigation and regulatory risk also extends to the commitments to or of our customers, business partners and suppliers, or if there is a deficiency in the controls or processes we have in place. In addition, ESG-focused activism may aim to require us to disclose significant information in relation to ESG-related actions and commitments and other matters, or, alternatively, claim that our ESG-related commitments, activities and alliances are incompatible with investor expectations, our corporate purpose or other laws and regulations. The Group may also face the risk of other forms of climate-related litigation, including claims brought by NGOs pursuant to the 2017 French 'Loi de Vigilance', impacts from potential anti-trust claims against net zero or other standard- and target- setting organizations of which AXA may be a member, mis-selling, fraud, breaches of fundamental human rights, and breaches of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe foregoing risks are evolving in the context of a wideranging increase of ESG-related rules, guidance, initiatives and disclosure regimes, including at the French, European Union and international levels, designed to ensure that companies are transparent about their climate and ESG-related risks, strategy, targets and goals, and how they are organizing themselves to address ESG challenges. These and similar regulatory requirements, as well as any further regulations regarding the transition to a lower-carbon economy, sustainability and other ESG-related rules and guidance, which may overlap or conflict with one another, could increase our legal and compliance costs, expose us to new or additional risks and adversely a/ff ect our business or the value of our investments. Conflicting political and social objectives may create geopolitical differences, including divergent or incompatible approaches to the energy transition, climate policy and 'net-zero' initiatives taken by governments and regulators in different jurisdictions, all of which create increased complexity and legal and compliance risks. These di/ff erences could also have economic consequences and undermine our ability to fulfill our ESG commitments and support the energy transition.

For investment-related climate risk analysis, please refer to Section 4.3 ' Climate change and biodiversity loss - Risks and impacts in relation to climate change and biodiversity loss '  of this Annual Report.\n\nSeveral organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to di/ff erent ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industry may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. If we are unable to meet the targets, standards, or expectations, whether established by us or third parties, this could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, or loss of customer and/or investor confidence, which could adversely a/ff ect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe are also exposed to activist campaigns targeting public companies in other areas, which may come from shareholders, activist funds, non-governmental and other organizations and have increased in recent years. These campaigns have focused on strategic and business reorientations, changes in management and compensation, Board representation, geopolitical issues and other matters. Responding to any activist claims (including the ESG claims described above) can be costly and timeconsuming and may adversely a/ff ect our business by, among other things, diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, senior management, and employees away from the execution of business strategies. These campaigns raise substantial risks for targeted companies.\n\nThese and other liability risks related to ESG and climate change could lead to increased claims and defense costs or materially adversely a/ff ect the value of our investments, financial condition and results of operations. Our share price, reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted by such risks, or as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to ESG or climate matters and regulatory compliance. Our sustainability strategy, to which we devote substantial resources, cannot fully protect us from these risks. For more information about AXA's sustainability strategy, please refer to Section 4.1'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business\n\nCollection, transfer, and protection of significant amounts of sensitive data are critical to the operation of our business. Regulations in this area are quickly evolving around the world, which could adversely a/ff ect our business if we fail to adapt our rules, internal controls, and strategy to the emerging regulatory environment.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 dated April 27, 2016 on the protection and movement of personal data (as amended,  'GDPR') entered into force on May 25, 2018. GDPR significantly modified the EU data protection framework and, in particular, imposed new restrictions on data usage/processing (including profiling), disclosure to customers and a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. Similar data protection regulations to GDPR have entered into force in many other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, certain US states, China, Brazil, Algeria, Egypt, and Thailand.\n\nIn December 2023, the EU Parliament and Council negotiators reached a provisional agreement on the AI Act, which is expected to be voted on in 2024 and to enter into force in 2026. This regulation will establish obligations for AI based on its potential risks and impact. Competent authorities will be able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 7% of their global annual turnover. AI regulations will likely enter into force in many other jurisdictions, including China. In the meantime, competent authorities may apply stringent GDPR or other data privacy laws to AI which involves personal data.\n\nThere is a risk that data collected by the Group and its third-party service providers is not processed in accordance with notices provided to, or obligations imposed by, data subjects, regulators or other counterparties, or in compliance with applicable dataprivacy laws. The Group's IT and other systems may also in future be exposed to hacking and unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or security breaches or other intentional or unintentional acts by parties acting from within or outside the Group, which could result in sensitive data (including customer and employee data) being stolen, lost or misused. Remote working arrangements and the accelerated digitalization of our operations may increase these threats. Negligence or failure to implement and follow internal Group policies, in particular regarding encryption of data, or to fail to perform adequate internal data collection/processing",

While we currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the United States and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required, such mechanisms may be subject to future challenge or to stricter scrutiny by the competent authorities, and further changes in applicable regulations may potentially increase our legal and compliance costs, or result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation. In July 2023, the European Commission announced a final adequacy decision for the EUUS Data Privacy Framework (the 'EU-US DPF'), a data transfer mechanism that would replace the invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield. As with the EU-US Privacy Shield, the EU-US DPF is limited to entities subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission or Department of Transportation, though other US statutory bodies recognized by the EU may be included in future annexes of the EU-US DPF. Because of this, the AXA Group believes that it may continue to rely on standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules as data transfer mechanisms to transfer data from the EU to the United States and other non-EU jurisdictions.\n\nAny failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, and data the/f\\_t , loss or misuse, a/ff ecting any Group entity or a third-party service provider, could result in significant regulatory sanctions, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, damage to our reputation, need to compensate customers, or customer litigation (including class actions and individual lawsuits), and consequently have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## As a global business, we are exposed to various local political, regulatory, financial, and social risks and challenges\n\nAs a global business we are exposed to a wide variety of local political, regulatory, business and financial risks, which may a/ff ect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolios, the levels of capital and surplus that we are required to hold, the credit quality of our counterparties and the way we are able to do business in particular countries and markets.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1 RISK FACTORS\n\nThese risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in the countries in which we operate, including:\n\n- \u25a0 the risk of nationalization or expropriation;\n- \u25a0 protectionist and nationalist measures;\n- \u25a0 price controls;\n- \u25a0 capital controls;\n- \u25a0 counter-inflationary measures;\n- \u25a0 political polarization;\n- \u25a0 restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n- \u25a0 international sanctions against certain countries and connected entities;\n- \u25a0 export controls;\n- \u25a0 tari/ff s and subsidies;\n- \u25a0 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 lack of local business experience in certain markets; and\n- \u25a0 risks  associated  with  exposure  to  insurance  industry insolvencies through policyholder guarantee funds or similar mechanisms.\n\nThese risks also include the risk of governments, supervisors, regulators and courts in the countries in which we operate adopting policyholder-favorable stances such as the mandatory provision of certain types of coverage, restrictions on cancellation or non-renewal of policies, extension of coverage (such as by extension of scope and/or period), and the imposition of pricing constraints/obligations to ensure the a/ff ordability of coverage for policyholders.\n\nIn addition, pressures on Households and social cohesion at the local or regional level in the form of reduced economic security and rising inequality, pressures on healthcare systems, food insecurity, or migration (and reactions to migration) could create significant societal problems or conflict in the countries, regions and/or markets in which we operate.\n\n## We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/or other proceedings which may a/ff ect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations\n\nWe are a party to numerous lawsuits (both class actions and individual lawsuits) in our corporate capacity and in our capacity as an insurer/reinsurer and involved in various regulatory\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Please refer to Section  6.6 - Note 28  'Litigations'  of this Annual Report. We may be involved in similar proceedings in the future.\n\nCertain of these lawsuits and investigations seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages (notably in the United States), and may involve allegations of bad-faith denials of coverage, which could potentially increase the overall amounts due, if any, in connection with such matters. These lawsuits also have the potential to impose interpretative judgements on insurance policy wordings and therefore increase our liabilities under these policies. Certain of the regulatory authorities involved in these proceedings have substantial powers over the conduct and operations of our business. The introduction of a class action system in France in 2014 and similar developments in certain other European jurisdictions, as well as the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 dated November 25, 2020, on consumer representative actions at the EU level, have increased and are likely to continue to increase litigation risks and costs. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings, as well as the volume of claims, against global financial institutions remains high. Furthermore, the increasing number of legislative and regulatory requirements, including tighter controls and higher capital requirements, consumer protection, enhancement of regulatory requirements for the oversight and disclosure of climate, ESG and sustainable finance-related initiatives as well as social and reputational trends may expose us to additional civil, criminal or regulatory actions, investigations, proceedings or sanctions, which could restrict business or have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group. For additional information, please refer to Section 7.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report and to the paragraph above 'Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters, as well as geopolitical matters, may result in increased litigation and may impact our business and results of operations'.\n\nIn addition, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioids crisis in the United States, attention to PFAS and the ongoing war in Ukraine, coverage lawsuits have been brought against insurers, including the AXA Group or its subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions, many of which are ongoing. For additional information, please refer to Section  6.6 - Note 28  'Litigations' of this Annual Report. The extent of reinsurance coverage on\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthese claims may vary depending, among other things, on the resolution of the coverage issues under the primary policies. We may also be involved in proceedings with our reinsurers regarding coverage. For additional information, please refer to the paragraph above 'Reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, in particular in the context of cyclical Property & Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses'.\n\n## Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations\n\nAs a global company operating in numerous jurisdictions, we are subject to various tax regimes and regulations. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations could result in administrative actions, litigation, higher tax expenses, payments and compliance costs.\n\nUncertainties in the interpretation or future developments of tax regimes, particularly in respect of the impact of retroactive interpretative changes to tax law by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions, may significantly a/ff ect our tax liabilities, return on investments and business operations. We have been and may increasingly become exposed to the risk of tax audits and investigations (both administrative and criminal) in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The international tax environment continues to change as a result of actions taken by the OECD, the European Union and national governments, which are intended to address concerns over perceived international tax avoidance techniques. In addition, the introduction of new or more restrictive regulations related to tax matters in the countries where the Group operates could significantly increase compliance costs. For example, tax measures adopted in connection with the OECD Pillar Two minimum taxation rules came into effect on January 1, 2024 and will increase our tax costs, as could any future EU VAT reform for insurance companies. We take tax positions that we believe are correct and reasonable in the course of our business. However, our tax positions may not be upheld by the relevant authorities, and tax audits, reassessments and investigations may result in adverse consequences, including penalties and sanctions. Our business operations, results, financial condition, liquidity, outlook or reputation could be materially a/ff ected if one or more of the aforementioned risks materialized.",

The report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements covers only information referred to in Note 4.\n\nThe AXA Group is engaged in Insurance, Reinsurance and Asset Management businesses on a global scale. As such, it is exposed to a wide variety of risks, including market risks, credit risk, insurance risks, operational risks, and other material risks, as further described in this Part 5 'Risk Factors and Risk Management' (1) and in Section 6.6 - Note 28 'Ligitations' of this Annual Report.\n\nTo  manage  these  risks,  the  Group  has  put  in  place  a comprehensive system of internal control and Risk Management\n\nThe three lines of defense are:\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n## Owners\n\n| 1 st  line of defense                                                     | Responsible for day-to-day risk and control  management and decision-making                                 | Management and sta/ff   | Management and sta/ff   | Actuarial function                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2 nd  line of defense (independent from the  Group's business operations) | Responsible for developing, facilitating and  monitoring an e/ff ective risk and control  framework         | Risk  Management        | Compliance              | Internal Control  (including  Internal Financial  Control) |\n| 3 rd  line of defense                                                     | Responsible for providing independent assurance  on the e/ff ectiveness of the overall control  environment |                         | Internal Audit          |                                                            |\n\nThe four key functions are:\n\n- \u25a0 the Risk Management function responsible for coordinating the second line of defense, ensuring that the risk appetite is implemented with respect to all material risks, and in charge of the design, implementation and validation of the AXA Group economic capital model which is the basis for the Group Solvency II internal model ('Internal Model'), the documentation of the Internal Model and any subsequent changes made to it as well as the analysis of the performance of this model and the production of summary reports thereof.

It provides a forum for all Group functions concerned to drive the appropriateness of the Internal Model. The Solvency II Committee reviews the whole SII documentation to be approved by the Group Board of Directors and, by extension to the Solvency II framework, the SII Committee also monitors the subjects related to Systemic risks.\n\nGroup Risk Committees are supported by local Risk Committees to ensure consistency in the implementation of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.\n\n## LINES OF DEFENSE ORGANIZATION\n\nThe control framework with three lines of defense has been designed to ensure that the risks that the AXA Group may face are systematically identified, measured, managed, and controlled.\n\n## First line of defense: management and sta/ff\n\nManagement  and  staff  have  primary  responsibility  for (i) establishing and maintaining an e/ff ective control environment, (ii) identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, services, and activities in their scope and (iii) designing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on the Group's internal control system in accordance with the risk strategy and policies on internal control as approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Group Actuarial function\n\nThe Group Actuarial function is headed by the Group Actuarial function holder, who reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer and Management Committee member (operational/ functional reporting) and to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff  icer, in charge of Finance, Risk Management, Strategy, ceded Reinsurance, Underwriting and Operations, and Dirigeant Effectif (executive who effectively runs the Company as required by Solvency II) (hierarchic reporting).\n\nThe Actuarial function, in accordance with article 48 of the Solvency II Directive:\n\n- \u25a0 coordinates the calculation of technical provisions;\n- \u25a0 ensures the appropriateness of the methodologies and underlying models used as well as the assumptions made in the calculation of technical provisions;\n- \u25a0 assesses the su/ff iciency and quality of the data used in the calculation of technical provisions;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- \u25a0 compares best estimates against experience;\n- \u25a0 informs the administrative, management or supervisory body of the reliability and adequacy of the calculation of technical provisions;\n- \u25a0 oversees the calculation of technical provisions in the cases set out in article 82 of the Solvency II Directive;\n- \u25a0 expresses an opinion on the overall underwriting policy;\n- \u25a0 expresses an opinion on the adequacy of reinsurance arrangements;\n- \u25a0 contributes to the effective implementation of the Risk Management system referred to in article 44 of the Solvency II Directive, in particular with respect to the risk modelling underlying the calculation of the capital requirements set out in Chapter VI, Sections 4 and 5, and to the assessment referred to in article 45 of the Solvency II Directive.\n\nThe Group Actuarial function holder annually produces an Actuarial report submitted to the Board of Directors, and an opinion on the reserves twice a year. The Actuarial report identifies any deficiencies and gives recommendations as to how such deficiencies should be remediated.\n\nThe Group Actuarial function holder alerts the Executive Committee/Board of Directors on any major deficiency on his area of responsibility.\n\n## Second line of defense: Group Risk Management function, including Group Internal Control function and Group Compliance function\n\n## Group Risk Management (GRM) function\n\nGRM is headed by the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer, who reports to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer, in charge of Finance, Risk Management, Strategy, ceded Reinsurance, Underwriting and Operations.\n\nThe role of GRM is to identify, quantify and manage the main risks to which the Group is exposed. To this end, GRM develops and deploys a number of risk measurements, monitoring instruments and methods, including a standardized methodology and framework for stochastic modelling (through the Internal Model) including the ORSA required under Solvency II.\n\nWhen appropriate, this role leads to the implementation of decisions that a/ff ect the Group's risk profile, helping to monitor the solvency position and manage the volatility of the Group's earnings through sound understanding of the risks taken and optimization of capital allocation.\n\nAs an integrated part of all the Group's business processes, GRM is also responsible for the definition and implementation of the ERM framework within the AXA Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Risk  Management  independence  and comprehensiveness: Chief Risk O/ff icers are independent from operations (first line of defense) and Internal Audit Department (third line of defense). The Risk Management Department, together with the Compliance and Internal Control Departments, constitute the second line of defense, whose objective is to develop, coordinate and monitor a consistent risk framework across the Group;\n- 2. Common risk appetite framework: Chief Risk O/ff icers are responsible for ensuring that senior management reviews and approves the risks to which the relevant entity or business unit is exposed, understands the consequences of an adverse development in such risks and have action plans that can be implemented in case of unfavorable developments;\n- 3. Systematic second opinion on key processes: Chief Risk Officers provide a systematic and independent second opinion on product approval process, reserves, reinsurance, investments and ALM and challenge on operational risks and strategic plan;\n- 4. Extensive use of internal model based on a robust economic capital metric : the Internal Model is intended to offer a concrete and powerful tool to control and measure exposure to most risks, in line with the Solvency II framework. The Internal Model is designed as a consistent and comprehensive Risk Management tool, which also forms an important element in the capital management and planning process;\n- 5. Proactive Risk Management: Chief Risk Officers are responsible for early detection of risks. This is ensured through challenge of and constant dialogue with the relevant business and supported by the AXA Group's emerging Risks Management framework.\n\nGRM oversees the operating entities' adherence to the ERM, supported by the local Risk Management teams. It coordinates\n\nI\n\nRisk Management for the Group, steers the local Risk Management Departments, and strives to develop a risk culture throughout the Group.\n\n## GROUP COMPLIANCE FUNCTION\n\nThe Group Compliance function is responsible for advising Executive Management and the Board of Directors on applicable compliance laws, regulations, and administrative provisions, and on the impact of regulatory change on AXA Group's operations. The Group Compliance function provides expertise, advice, and support to AXA entities to assess significant compliance matters, analyzes the major compliance risks and contributes to designing solutions to mitigate the risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group Compliance function manages a wide range of compliance related matters including (i) financial crime (which includes anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering and international sanctions/embargo compliance), (ii) data privacy, (iii) conduct and customer protection, (iv) compliance & ethics, (v) the monitoring of other major compliance and regulatory risks, and (vi) regular reporting of significant compliance and regulatory matters to Executive Management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance O/ff icer reports to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer & Group General Secretary.\n\nThe compliance activities within the Group are set out in a number of standards and policies which set the minimum requirements expected to be achieved by AXA entities and their Compliance functions.\n\nThe compliance section of the Group Standards contains standards and policies on significant risk areas affecting compliance activities and sets out the high-level controls and monitoring principles to which the entities must adhere. Adherence  to  the  Standards  and  Policies  (Compliance Governance, Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions, Anti-Bribery, Cross Border, Data Privacy) is mandatory. In 2022, a new Standard on Conduct and Customer Protection was established to support",

It is designed to ensure that AXA continues to provide its customers with suitable advice, products, and services to meet their needs. The Standard was rolled out across the Group in 2023.\n\nThe  Group  Compliance  function  undertakes  an  annual Compliance Risk Assessment exercise which requires entities to identify the most significant compliance risks to which they are exposed. Based on this assessment an Annual Compliance Plan is developed for the following year. Using the same methodology and to comply with the French extraterritorial law (Sapin II) and ACPR requirements, separate Anti-Bribery and Corruption Risk Assessment and Anti-Money Laundering Risk Assessment were also implemented across AXA entities. These risk assessments enable entities to identify in a more granular manner the associated risks.\n\nThe Group Compliance function has implemented a number of monitoring processes. For example, the Compliance In-Depth Review (CIDR) which is an ongoing program of structured onsite Compliance reviews conducted by the Group Compliance Department to AXA Group Companies worldwide. The main purpose of these reviews is to measure adherence to the Group Standards and Policies, to define improvement action plans, to provide experienced advice, including on compliance technical aspects, and to rate the entity's maturity level against other Group companies. This program was introduced in 2009 using a risk-based approach.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group Compliance function reports to the Group Audit Risk & Compliance Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors (as required) on significant compliance matters. These include major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, results of the Compliance Risk Assessment, and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\n## GROUP INTERNAL CONTROL FUNCTION\n\nTo further strengthen its control environment, the AXA Group established in 2017 a centralized Internal Control function within the second line of defense independent from business operations. The Group Head of Internal Control is reporting to the Group Head of Operational Risk and Internal Control. The Group Internal Control Department is responsible for the development of a standardized methodology and framework for internal control and for oversight of its implementation in the AXA Group's subsidiaries. For more information on the internal control at local level, please refer to the paragraph 'Risk Management and internal control at local level' below.\n\nThe Internal Control framework of the AXA Group:\n\n- \u25a0 is based on the principle of proportionality and takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of the entities' operations;\n- \u25a0 is aligned with the COSO 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tradeway Commission;\n- \u25a0 is an integral part of the Risk Management thus providing the Executive Management with a view of the risk and control environment;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- \u25a0 is underpinned by the Group Internal Control Standard and Group Solvency II Internal Control Policy, first approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of AXA SA in December 2017;\n- \u25a0 encompasses Internal Financial Control, implemented since 2010 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR), and extended to Solvency II in 2014 to contribute to the Internal Model validation process. For more information on Internal Financial Control, please refer to the paragraphs 'Financial reporting, disclosure, controls and procedures' and 'Internal Model validation' below.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group internal control reports to the Group Operational and Information Audit, Risk, Compliance Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Third line of defense: Group Internal Audit function\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function provides the Group Audit Committee and the Group's Management Committee with independent and objective assurance on the e/ff ectiveness of the overall control environment across the Group.\n\nThe Global Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chair of the AXA Group Audit Committee and to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff  icer and General Secretary.\n\nAll Internal Audit teams across the Group report to the Global Head of Internal Audit whilst also having a direct and unfettered reporting line to their local Audit Committee Chair and an administrative reporting line within their local management structure.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function exists to help the Board and Executive Management protect the assets, reputation, and sustainability of the organization by providing an independent and objective assurance activity designed to add value and improve the organization's operations. It helps the organization meet its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to challenge Executive Management and evaluate the e/ff ectiveness of Risk Management, control, and governance processes.\n\nGroup Internal Audit sets an annual plan of work, based on an assessment of both the inherent risk and the adequacy of controls as well as consideration of the audit cycle. The plan is formally reviewed, and its performance formally monitored by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOver the audit cycle, the principal risk areas of applicable audit universe components for each entity are expected to be audited. Any exceptions identified are notified to the Audit Committee.\n\nA report is issued at the conclusion of each audit assignment to the relevant senior management. The results of the audits and resolution status of internal audit issues are presented to the relevant Audit Committee and Executive Management Committee on a regular basis.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The Audit Committees have a critical role in reviewing financial results and other financial information prepared by the management of these subsidiaries, financial reporting and control processes, critical accounting policies, specific accounting issues, key risks, and systems of internal control, fraud, and similar issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group has established Standards that apply to AXA SA and entities (including Joint ventures) where AXA has the majority of the voting rights or has a minority interest but exercises control through other means such as management. They are mandatory for all entities (including AXA SA) within scope unless otherwise indicated. The Standards focus on critical requirements and form part of the overall Risk Management framework which allow the Group to have a clear understanding of risks, both locally and Group-wide.\n\nChief Executive O/ff icers are required to certify annually to the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer that to the best of their knowledge their entities comply with the Standards. Entity Boards must be formally informed of the Annual Certifications, together with any material breaches, areas of non-compliance and corresponding mitigation plans in order to monitor progress of remedial actions.\n\nPlease note that in the following paragraphs AXA SA is included within the scope of local entities.\n\nRisk Management: Risk Management is a local responsibility, in accordance with GRM standards and guidelines. The roles and responsibilities of local Risk Management teams are validated jointly by the Executive Committees of local entities and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer to ensure the alignment of central and local interests.\n\nThe minimum missions required for local Risk Management teams are:\n\n- \u25a0 coordinating the second line of defense locally (which covers among others Compliance, Internal Control, Security) through a specific system of governance framework;\n- \u25a0 ensuring that the risk appetite is implemented with respect to all risks consistently with the Group's risk appetite, with enhanced reporting, risk limits and decision processes;\n- \u25a0 providing a second opinion on key processes, such as the definition of characteristics for new products before launch, reserves, ALM studies & asset allocation and reinsurance strategies;\n- \u25a0 with respect to the Internal Model, Risk Management checking the adequacy of the local risk profile, and implementing, testing and validating the Internal Model.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nLocal Chief Risk O/ff icers head the local Risk Management teams within each operational entity, and report both to their local Chief Executive O/ff icer and to the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. They are independent from operations and Internal Audit Departments. Local Chief Risk O/ff icers regularly report to the local Board of Directors (or to a sub-Committee) on Risk Management matters.\n\nTheir teams are responsible for controlling and managing risks within Group policies and limits, and for validating investment or underwriting decisions through local Risk Committees. The Group Chief Risk O/ff icer chairs the Chief Risk O/ff icers' meeting composed of the Chief Risk O/ff icers of AXA's main subsidiaries, which meets on a quarterly basis and have monthly calls.\n\nInternal Control: Internal Control is a local responsibility in accordance with the Internal Control Standard and Policy. Entities are expected to:\n\n- \u25a0 define and document their controls and control procedures covering all important risks and processes (First line responsibility);\n- \u25a0 regularly verify and challenge the e/ff ectiveness of the control environment (Second line responsibility);\n- \u25a0 implement a comprehensive monitoring and reporting on internal control deficiencies at a senior level of the organization to ensure that these are rectified in an adequate and timely manner.\n\nLocal Heads of Internal Control (or equivalent) are independent from operations and report preferably to their local Chief Risk O/ff  icer. Local Heads of Internal Control (or equivalent) regularly report to the local Risk Committee and to their local Audit Committee on Internal Control matters.\n\nCompliance: the local Compliance functions are expected to undertake an annual Compliance Risk Assessment to identify the major compliance risks to which the business is exposed. Based on the Compliance Risk Assessment, an Annual Compliance Plan must be developed at the end of each year for the following year. The local Compliance function must directly report on a regular basis to local senior management and the local Audit Committee (or equivalent body), on significant compliance matters, including key compliance risks, major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, the Annual Compliance Plan, outstanding Compliance In-Depth Review action points and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\nActuarial function: the local Actuarial function holders report both to local Finance, Risk, or the Chief Executive O/ff icer and to the Group Actuarial function holder. Their role is, in the same way as for the Group Actuarial function, defined in accordance with article 48 of the Solvency II Directive.",

PBRC works with local PBR units within the Finance Departments of Group subsidiaries.\n\nThe local PBR units are responsible for producing their respective contribution to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPBRC's role encompasses the following principal activities:\n\n- \u25a0 development of both accounting and reporting standards;\n- \u25a0 managing process instructions with the subsidiaries for the various exercises;\n- \u25a0 managing the Group's financial consolidation and reporting systems;\n- \u25a0 producing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and analyzing key performance indicators;\n- \u25a0 developing and using management control tools;\n- \u25a0 managing and consolidating the Solvency II Own Funds and related actuarial indicators;\n- \u25a0 coordinating the production of the Group's Annual Reports filed with the AMF;\n- \u25a0 coordinating the production of reports filed with the ACPR related to Solvency II;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- \u25a0 liaising with the Statutory Auditors and contributing to Audit Committee meetings as required;\n- \u25a0 coordinating the production of the Statement of Non-Financial Performance; and\n- \u25a0 fostering convergence of accounting and financial reporting processes, systems and organizations for insurance activities in Europe.\n\nPBRC has defined and implemented a set of policies and procedures to ensure that the consolidation process leading to the consolidated financial statements is timely and accurate. This consolidation process is based on the following:\n\n## Definition of standards and use of a centralized information system\n\nGroup accounting standards, which are consistent with accounting and regulatory principles, are set forth in the 'AXA Group Accounting Manual' and updated regularly by PBRC experts. These guidelines are submitted to AXA's Statutory Auditors for review before being made available to AXA's subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's consolidation and reporting processes are based on a central information system 'Magnitude'. This tool is managed and updated by a dedicated team. This system is also used to deliver the management reporting information and the Solvency II Own Funds. The process through which this management reporting information and the Solvency II Own Funds are produced and validated is the same as the one used to prepare consolidated financial information.\n\n## Operating control mechanisms\n\nAt entity level, AXA's subsidiaries are responsible for recording and controlling accounting and financial data that comply with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and reflect consolidation rules under IFRS accounting standards. In this respect, the Chief Financial O/ff icer of each entity signs o/ff  on the accuracy of their respective contribution to the consolidated figures reported through 'Magnitude' and their compliance with both the AXA Group Accounting Manual and instructions in all frameworks produced (IFRS, actuarial indicators, and Solvency II Own Funds) within the internal financial control program.\n\nAt PBRC level, accounting, financial and economic information reported by entities are analyzed by teams that liaise with subsidiaries on a full-time basis. In particular, these teams analyze the compliance with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and Group actuarial standards.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

It is designed to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting and provide an overall framework for the annual IFC program precising the Scope of application and governance.\n\nThe entities in IFC Scope are required to document their significant processes and key controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level. This is performed under the supervision of the Chief Financial O/ff icer, sponsor of the IFC program. The independent Internal Financial Control function, anchored within Risk Management for most entities, is in charge of testing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of those key controls, and ensuring that identified control deficiencies are remediated.\n\nAt each year-end, the in-Scope entities must perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process, involving formal sign-o/ff  by process owners and with a formal management report from the entity's Chief Financial O/ff icer and Chief Risk O/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff  ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group has implemented a formal internal review and sign-o/ff process pursuant to which all Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives are required to certify various matters covered in AXA's Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis process is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- 1. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off Certificates, which are required to be submitted by all local Chief Financial O/ff icers to PBRC, together with the required subsidiary financial reporting and consolidation information;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- 2. IFC Management reports are required to be submitted by the Chief Financial O/ff icer or another senior executive of every in-scope entity, as part of the IFC program dedicated to ICOFR;\n- 3. Disclosure Controls & Procedures certificates, which are required to be submitted by AXA's Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives pursuant to which each of these executives is required to review the Group's Universal Registration Document and formally certify (i) the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Annual Report with respect to the companies under his/her responsibility, and (ii) the e/ff ectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and ICOFR at companies under his/her responsibility (with specific disclosure of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses). In addition, as part of this 'sub-certification' process, these executives are required to review and comment on a number of cross-sectional disclosures in the Universal Registration Document relating to risk and other matters;\n- 4. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off certificates on the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: PBRC provides Chief Financial O/ff icers with the contribution of the entities under their responsibility to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to facilitate their certification on the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Universal Registration Document of the Group.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Appendix I 'Management's annual evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting' of this Annual Report.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Group has established a comprehensive system of Internal Control procedures and mechanisms that management believes appropriate and adapted to its business and the global scale of its operations.\n\nHowever, all Internal Control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee against the materialization of risks and control failures. Even systems determined to be e/ff ective by the management may not prevent or detect all human errors, all system malfunctions, all fraud, or all misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance.",

At Group level, the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer is responsible for developing the ORSA policy, implementing the ORSA process and coordinating the ORSA reporting.\n\nThe ORSA policy defines minimum standards for assessing and reporting own risks and Solvency to be applied across the Group. Adherence to this policy is expected to be promoted and monitored by all entity heads of Risk Management Department (Chief Risk O/ff icers).\n\nThe Group ORSA report is reviewed annually by the Solvency II Committee and presented, first, to the ARCC, and then to the Audit and the Finance & Risk Committees, before being submitted to the Board of Directors, which approves the conclusions of the Group ORSA report and authorizes its filing with the ACPR.\n\nBeyond the annual ORSA report, a quarterly assessment is performed to update the Group's risk position against Risk Appetite limits and adapt management actions accordingly. This information is reported to the ARCC which regularly reviews all material audit, risk and compliance issues faced by the Group and to the Finance & Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## PURPOSE AND CONTENT\n\nORSA is a key component of our Risk Management encompassing processes to identify, assess, manage and report the short to medium-term risks associated with our business, with the aim to assess the overall solvency needs related to the Group's risk profile.\n\nORSA mainly encompasses Risk Management and financial activities, which are organized around the following processes:\n\n- \u25a0 Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) & Eligible Own Funds (EOF) quarterly calculation;\n- \u25a0 liquidity risk reporting;\n- \u25a0 strategic planning and financial projections;\n- \u25a0 risk appetite process;\n- \u25a0 stress and scenario testing analysis and monitoring; and\n- \u25a0 reputation, regulatory, emerging and strategic risk assessment and review.\n\nThe ORSA report provides an assessment on:\n\n- \u25a0 the overall Solvency needs through the measurement of quantifiable risks considering risk mitigation actions implemented in current economic context and approved business strategy and within approved risk appetite limits. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. This is supported by the Enterprise Risk Management system, including the identification,  monitoring  and  management  of  nonquantifiable risks;\n- \u25a0 the compliance, on a continuous basis, with (i) regulatory capital requirements, through the assessment of the ability to meet capital requirements using the approved Internal Model, in compliance with the Solvency II regulatory standard, as well as (ii) requirements regarding technical provisions. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. Also, the extensive use of the Internal Model outputs for key decision-making processes provides a feedback loop for improving the modelling according to the evolution of the risk profile;\n- \u25a0 the significance with which the risk profile of the AXA Group deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculated on the basis of the Internal Model. Extensive validation tests are performed to assess the relevance of the Internal Model and the model error. Limitations of the Internal Model and evolution plan resulting from the validation activities are presented.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The internal model of the Group (the 'Internal Model') is used in its Risk Management systems and decisionmaking processes. The ACPR has approved the use by the Group of its Internal Model to calculate its SCR since Solvency II is in force. The Internal Model encompasses the use of AXA Group's economic capital model on all material entities.\n\nAXA continues to review regularly the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any major change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR. In addition, the Group monitors EIOPA's work program which, through its objectives, is also expected to continue to carry out consistency reviews of European insurers' internal models. Such review may lead to further regulatory changes to increase convergence and to strengthen oversight of cross-border groups, as well as changes to internal models and Solvency II capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's main goal in using its Internal Model as opposed to the Solvency II standard formula is to better reflect the Group's risk profile in its SCR. This is reflected through several objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 taking into account local specificities - the Group is a global company, and caters to a wide range of insurance markets with a variety of products o/ff ered targeting certain demographics and with di/ff ering risk exposures. It is therefore appropriate, to the extent possible, to calibrate stresses specific for these risk profiles and to allow for the benefits of diversification of risks which arise as a result of being spread over these markets;\n- \u25a0 addressing shortcomings inherent to the standard formula based on its expertise, the Group can improve on the approach of the standard formula (which is naturally constrained by its\n\ngeneral scope, and which does not cover all measurable risks) and have models more appropriate to the scope of the Group; and\n\n- \u25a0 allowing for better evolution of the model over time - as the Group's experience increases, business expands to new markets and product innovations create di/ff erent risks to consider, the flexibility of an internal model allows the specificities of these developments to be reflected.\n\nThe Internal Model is based on a common definition of risks used consistently throughout the Group. It aims to ensure that the Company risk mapping is comprehensive and is followed in a consistent way across the Company and that e/ff icient procedures and reporting are in place so that roles and responsibilities are allocated to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report key risks.\n\nThe Group risk grid (2) aims to identify all material risks applicable to the Company's insurance businesses. The Internal Model is intended to capture all material risks to which the Group is exposed from the risk assessment performed at sub-risk level to the overall aggregation of risk categories.\n\nThe underlying methodologies and assumptions used in the economic capital model are regularly reviewed to ensure that they accurately reflect the AXA Group's risk profile and new methods are developed and integrated regularly (in accordance with the Internal Model change policy).\n\nThe SCR, calculated on the basis of the Internal Model, represents the value at risk of Group EOF at the 99.5 th percentile over a oneyear horizon. In other words, the Solvency Capital Requirement is the capital needed to sustain an extreme shock likely to occur with a 0.5% probability ( i.e., a 1 in 200 years event). It aims at including all material quantifiable risks (market, credit, insurance and operational) and reflecting the Group's diversified profile.\n\nIn addition to the risks that impact the SCR through the Internal Model calculation, the Group also monitors its liquidity risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and regulatory risks as well as emerging threats.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## AXA GROUP SOLVENCY II RATIO\n\nIn addition to the SCR assessment, which intends to cover all quantifiable risks to which the Group is exposed (insurance, financial, and operational risks), the AXA Group performs sensitivity analyses of its Solvency II ratio to material risks and events.\n\nThese analyses quantify, for instance, the potential impact on the AXA Group's Solvency II ratio of (i) financial shocks on corporate bond and sovereign spreads, on interest rates, and on equity, and credit migration, (ii) a wide range of shocks reflecting historical stress events (such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the 2011 financial crisis), and (iii) standardized shocks such as one year out of two hundred pandemic spread on mortality exposures, a vicennial Nat-Cat shock or a vicennial operational risk.\n\nThese sensitivity analyses do not take into account preemptive management actions that might be taken to mitigate the e/ff ects of the defined shocks, nor indicate a probability of occurrence, but are designed:\n\n- \u25a0 to demonstrate that the AXA Group Solvency ratio is resilient to a wide range of shocks;\n- \u25a0 to ensure through the risk appetite framework that the management reviews and acknowledges the risks that arise in their company, understands the consequences of an adverse development of these risks, and have action plans that can be implemented in case of unfavorable developments; and\n- \u25a0 to verify the robustness of the Internal Model.\n\nThe Solvency II ratio as of December 31, 2023, as published on February 22, 2024, was assessed at 227% (1) , compared to 215% as of December 31, 2022 .\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL GOVERNANCE\n\nAt Group level, the governance bodies involved in the Internal Model governance are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the Board of Directors reviews the Internal Model, and authorizes the application to the ACPR for approval of major changes to the Internal Model;\n- \u25a0 the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee; and\n- \u25a0 the Solvency II Committee.\n\nAt Group level, the Internal Model is reviewed, tested, and approved on an ongoing basis by the Solvency II Committee. The Solvency II Committee is supported by risk technical working groups reviewing changes proposed to the Internal Model and presenting conclusions of these diligences to the Solvency II\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCommittee. The Solvency II Committee also reviews the Internal Model validation and model change processes and liaises with local governance. It also reviews the conclusions of the regular validation activities.\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL VALIDATION\n\nThe Group has implemented and documented a validation process of its Internal Model to monitor its performance and continued adequacy. This process and associated governance are documented in the Group validation policy, endorsed by the ARCC.\n\nThe  Group  validation  policy  is  supplemented  by  local validation policies specifying the local validation activities and responsibilities.\n\nValidation does not only apply to the quantitative aspects of the model (input data, theory & methodology, parameters & assumptions, data, results) but also encompasses the qualitative aspects of the model: expert judgment, documentation, model governance, use test, systems/IT.\n\nRisk Management performs regular integrated validation activities, described in the Internal Model validation policy, mostly organized around:\n\n- \u25a0 validation of the model structure, modelling choices, parameters, and assumptions; and\n- \u25a0 validation of the Solvency Capital Requirement calculation and results.\n\nThese tasks are performed mostly within the Risk Management Departments in charge of the model, through controls and validation activities using validation tools such as sensitivity tests, back testing, scenario testing, and stability analysis and any other relevant activity.\n\nThese validation procedures are complemented by independent challenge and validation of assumptions, key parameters, and results through Committees (including assumptions Committees, calibration Committees and clearance Committees) intended to provide an adequate level of expertise and seniority.\n\nIn  particular,  Group  Risk  Management  teams  provide independent testing of the local model choices, local parameters, assumptions, or calibration as well as local results.\n\nApart from this fully integrated validation, sanctioned by the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer's review and sign-o/ff , a comprehensive independent review process has been defined and implemented to provide adequate comfort to AXA Group management and Board of Directors that the model and its outputs meet a 'fit for purpose' standard.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

IMR controls are performed on a 3-year rolling basis, independently from closing agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nBoth IMR and IFC are fully independent from the development, the governance, and the processing of the Internal Model.\n\nFurthermore, independent third parties have been engaged to provide a positive assurance opinion to the AXA Group Board of Directors on the compliance of the Internal Model with the Solvency II Directive requirements. Such independent opinion is provided based on FY2022 process and results, at Group and local levels.\n\nAt the end of the annual validation process, the Board of Directors is provided with a report summarizing the conclusions of the internal review by Risk Management and the conclusion of the independent review by IMR and IFC as well as a review by independent third parties as aforementioned.\n\n## Governance of investment strategy and Asset Liability Management (ALM)\n\nThe AXA Group, as an insurance group, follows an investment strategy mainly driven by Asset Liability Management (ALM). The overall objectives of all investment decisions made within the Group are to meet its obligations and commitments to policyholders, to protect the solvency of the Group's entities, and to generate superior return over time.\n\n## GENERAL INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group Chief Investment O/ff icer (Group CIO) heads the Groupwide community of local insurance companies CIOs, the central Investment & ALM Department, and reports to the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer. In particular, he is responsible for aligning AXA's investment strategy with the Group's broader strategy, including its commitments to responsible investment, promoting better cooperation between entities, improving the strategy and investment methodology and steering investment decisions.\n\nLocal investment & ALM activities are steered by local CIOs. Local CIOs manage local portfolios, aiming at an optimized riskreturn ratio, maintain reporting lines to the Group, and manage close relationships with asset managers and local stakeholders. Moreover, they are responsible for the investment performance and for implementing and executing a sound Asset Liability Management.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE BODIES\n\nIn order to e/ff iciently coordinate local and global investment processes, decisions within the Group's investment community are taken by two main governance bodies:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group Investment Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. This Committee defines the Group's investment strategy, steers tactical asset allocation, evaluates new investment opportunities and monitors the Group's investment performance; and\n- \u25a0 the Group Financial Risk Committee is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. The Group Chief Investment O/ff icer is also member of this Committee (please refer to the paragraph 'Audit Risk and Compliance Committee' above).\n\nAt the entity level, each insurance company has a local Investment and ALM Committee whose terms of reference are approved by the local Executive Committees.\n\nThese Committees are responsible for, inter alia, defining the entity's Strategic Asset Allocation, approving, and monitoring investments, meeting local compliance obligations, and reviewing the participation in investment proposals syndicated by the Group, as well as local investment proposals.\n\n## ALM STUDIES AND STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION\n\nALM aims to match assets with the liabilities generated by the sale of insurance policies. The objective is to define the optimal asset allocation so that all liabilities can be met with the highest degree of confidence while maximizing the expected investment return.",

        "page_content": "ALM studies are performed by the Investment & ALM Department with the support of internal asset managers when appropriate and a second opinion is provided by the Risk Management Department. They use methodologies and modelling tools that develop deterministic and stochastic scenarios, embedding policyholders' behavior considerations for the liabilities, financial market evolution for the assets and taking into account existing interaction between the two. This process aims at maximizing expected returns given a defined level of risk. Furthermore, a series of additional constraints are taken into account, such as Solvency II economic capital model considerations, earnings stability, protection of the solvency margin, preservation of liquidity, as well as local and consolidated capital adequacy and requirement.\n\nALM constraints are also taken into account when new insurance products are being designed as part of the product approval process (see Section 5.6 'Insurance risks - Product approval' of this Annual Report).\n\nAt the entity level, the strategic asset allocation issued from the ALM study must be reviewed by local Risk Management, and verified against predefined risk appetite limits, before being approved by the local Investment and ALM Committee.\n\n## INVESTMENT APPROVAL PROCESS\n\nInvestment opportunities, like non-standard investments, new strategies, or new structures, are subject to an Investment Approval Process (IAP) in line with the third pillar of the Group Risk Management principles which provides for a systematic second opinion on key processes. The IAP ensures key characteristics of the investment are analyzed, such as risk and return expectations, experience and expertise of the investment management teams, as well as accounting, tax, legal and reputational issues.\n\nThe IAP is completed at Group level for any significant investment, depending on the investment size and the number of entities participating in it. The successful completion of an IAP is done a/f\\_t er the production of a second independent opinion by Group Risk Management. The IAP is used and completed at local level to cover local regulatory characteristics (including tax and statutory accounting).\n\nLocal IAP is also run for investments in new asset classes for local entities under the same principles.\n\n## GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nProducts involving hedging programs based on derivative instruments are designed and executed with the support of dedicated teams at AXA Investment Managers and AXA SA. In a similar way, this set-up ensures that all entities benefit from technical expertise, legal protection, and good execution of such transactions within the following governance framework for derivatives.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2 INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nDerivative strategies are reviewed by local Investment and ALM Committees. In addition, there is a segregation of duties between those responsible for making investment decisions, executing transactions, processing trades, and instructing the custodian. This segregation of duties aims in particular at avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe market risks arising from derivatives are regularly monitored taking into account the Group's various constraints (such as risk appetite and Internal Model).\n\nSuch monitoring is designed to ensure market risks, arising from cash or derivative instruments, are properly controlled and remain within approved limits.\n\nLegal risk is addressed by defining a standardized master agreement. The Group's business units may trade derivatives only if they are covered by legal documentation which complies with the requirements set out in the Group standards. Any change to certain mandatory provisions defined in the Group standards must be approved by GRM.\n\nAdditionally, there is a centralized counterparty risk policy. GRM has established rules on authorized counterparties, minimum requirements regarding collateral and counterparty exposure limits.\n\nThe operational risk related to derivatives is measured and managed in the context of the Group's global operational risk framework. Furthermore, execution and management of derivatives are centralized within dedicated teams, reducing the AXA Group's operational risk.\n\nValuation Risk is also addressed through the use of dedicated teams, within the Group's asset managers and banks. They independently counter-valuate the derivatives positions so as to achieve appropriate accounting, payment, and collateral management. They also challenge the prices proposed by counterparties in the event that the applicable AXA entity wishes to initiate, terminate, or restructure derivatives. Such capacity in pricing requires strong expertise, which relies on rigorous market analysis and the ability to follow the most up-to-date market developments for new derivatives instruments.\n\n## INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFor a large proportion of its assets, the Group utilizes the services of asset managers to invest in the market:\n\n- \u25a0 local AXA companies assign the day-to-day management of their asset portfolios primarily to AXA's Asset Management subsidiary, namely AXA Investment Managers. Local CIOs continuously monitor, analyze, and challenge asset managers' performances; and\n- \u25a0 in order to benefit from a more asset-specific and/or geographical expertise, the Group may also decide to invest through external asset managers. In such event, thorough due diligence analyses are performed by the Investment and the Risk Management communities, and a continuous monitoring is implemented at both Group and Local levels.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

And the paragraph 'Market-related risks' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group is exposed to financial market risks through its core business of financial protection ( i.e., insurance) and through the financing of its activities as part of its equity and debt management.\n\nThe market risks to which Property & Casualty (P&C), Life & Health portfolios are exposed arise from a variety of factors including:\n\n- \u25a0 a decline in market returns may cause us to accelerate amortization of intangible assets;\n- \u25a0 a decline in returns on assets (linked to a sustained fall in yields on fixed income investments or to lower equity markets) could reduce investment margins on General Account products or fees on Unit-Linked contracts and impact the performance of asset managers;\n- \u25a0 a change in yields on fixed-income investments (linked to changes in interest rates or in credit spreads) affects the market value of investments and the fair value of insurance contracts that could impact adversely the Group's solvency or liquidity position, and increase policyholder's surrenders due to competitive pressures;\n- \u25a0 a decline in market value of other investments (relating, for example, to equity, real estate, or alternatives, etc.) could adversely impact the Group's solvency position, as well as available surplus;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 a change in foreign-exchange rates would have limited impact for the operating units since foreign-currency commitments are matched to a large extent by assets in the same currency or covered by hedges, but it could affect the earnings contribution in euros;\n- \u25a0 furthermore, Health and Property & Casualty activities are subject to inflation which may increase the compensation payable to policyholders, so that the actual payments may exceed the associated liabilities set aside. This risk can be significant for long-tail businesses but is managed through regular pricing adjustments or specific protections against peaks of inflation.\n\nThe Group policies implemented to manage these risks are tailored to each product type and their related risks.\n\nThe main market risks to which the AXA Group is exposed are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 interest-rate risk, spread risk and equity risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries; and\n- \u25a0 risks relating to the management of holding companies' exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and debt.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to market risks is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section 5.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's Liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section 5.5 'Liquidity Risk' of this Annual Report).",

This approach aims to allow a swift reaction in an accurate and targeted manner to changes in financial markets, political and economic environments in which the Group operates.\n\nA wide variety of Risk Management techniques are used to control and mitigate the market risks to which the Group is exposed. These techniques, used primarily in all operating subsidiaries, include:\n\n- \u25a0 local risk appetite governance and processes, including functional limits on market risks defined locally and approved by the local Board or Executive Committee;\n- \u25a0 Asset Liability Management (ALM), i.e., defining an optimal strategic asset allocation with respect to the liabilities' structure in order to reduce the risk to a desired level;\n- \u25a0 a  disciplined  investment  process,  requiring  for  any sophisticated investment a formal thorough analysis by the Investment Department, and a second opinion by Risk Management;\n- \u25a0 hedging of financial risks when they exceed the tolerance levels set by the Group. Operational management of derivatives is based on stringent rules and is mainly performed by AXA SA for the holding company activities and AXA Investment Managers for operating units;\n- \u25a0 a regular monitoring of the financial risks on the Group Solvency II ratio; and\n- \u25a0 reinsurance which also o/ff ers solutions to mitigate certain financial risks.\n\nAs regards the market risks relating to the management of holding companies' foreign exchange and interest rates exposure, the following Risk Management measures have been defined and implemented.\n\nFor the purpose of optimizing the financial management and control of financial risks linked to AXA SA and its sub-holding companies, the Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department has defined a methodology to monitor and assess financial risks.\n\nThe policy on the management of holding companies' interest rate risk aims at monitoring and limiting the potential mediumterm variation in interest expenses and consequently at partially protecting future levels of interest expenses against certain movements in interest rates. Regarding foreign exchange risk, the purpose of the policy is to (i) partially protect the value of AXA's net foreign currency investments in its subsidiaries and (ii) protect significant cash flows.'.\n\nAXA regularly monitors its exchange rate hedging strategy and will continue to review its e/ff ectiveness and the potential need to adapt it taking into account impacts on earnings, value, solvency, gearing ratio and liquidity.\n\nThe Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department is in charge of producing reporting data that consolidate interest rate, foreign exchange, and liquidity risk exposures, as well as the interest expenses of AXA SA and its sub-holdings. This reporting also includes medium-term forecasts.\n\nSynthetic reports, including information about hedging strategies, are sent to, and reviewed by the Finance & Risk Committee of AXA's Board of Directors five times a year.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5.3 MARKET RISKS\n\n5",

These  procedures  are  adapted  and implemented locally and aim at fostering product innovation across the Group while maintaining risks under control. The validation framework relies among others on the results of the Solvency Capital Requirement's assessments, based on the AXA Group's Internal Model, to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they are brought to market.\n\nIn Life, as well as Health, the Product Approval Process is managed at local level for all traditional products meeting Group's minimum requirements, which allows maintaining time-to-market product launches. For sophisticated products, local entities require Group's approval before launch to ensure all long-term commitments are monitored at Group level and benefit from the Group expertise on enhanced or specific guarantees.\n\nIn Property & Casualty, methods are adapted to the underwriting of risks, while maintaining the principle of local decision-making\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbased on a documented approval procedure and using the output of the internal model. The aim is twofold:\n\n- \u25a0 for pre-launch business, the aim is to ensure that new risks underwritten by the Group have been scrutinized before proposing them to customers;\n- \u25a0 for post-launch business, appropriate profitability and risk control are performed to verify that the business remains in line with the Group's risk framework.\n\nThis framework is part of the Group underwriting policy and ensures that no risks are taken outside the Group tolerances and that value is created by adequate risk pricing.\n\n## EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nAXA Group reviews regularly its exposure to ensure that the risks underwritten are diversified geographically and by lines of business in order to manage risk concentration, and to verify adequacy of reinsurance.\n\nFor Life Health and Property & Casualty activities, AXA Group has developed and deployed common models and metrics to consistently measure risks throughout the Group (in particular via its economic capital framework as detailed in Section 5.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of the Annual Report. This enables the Group to verify that its exposure complies with consolidated risk appetite limits along the dimensions of earnings, Eligible Own Funds (EOF), solvency and liquidity. These tools also contribute substantially to monitoring the major risks (claims frequency deviation, claims severity, reinsurance, pricing consistency, natural and man-made catastrophes, biometric and behavior risks deviations).\n\nThis framework is included in the governance set out previously for product development control.\n\nIn the Life & Health businesses, these tools allow for mortality/ longevity risks to be analyzed on a multi-country basis. The AXA Group regularly monitors its exposure to these risks (including mortality, longevity and morbidity) and uses the results of this work to optimize its product design and its reinsurance coverage. These exposure analyses are supported by expert risk models in Life.\n\nRegarding  the  Property  &  Casualty  exposures, ad  hoc concentration risk models (internal and external for natural catastrophe and for man-made catastrophe) are developed to ensure yearly natural catastrophe volatility, coming from events such as windstorm, earthquake, hurricane or typhoon, or catastrophe man-made events, such as cyber or liability ones, are not likely to a/ff ect the Group above the set tolerance levels.",

This has been complemented by a reinforced and continuously enhanced expertise in the modelling of systemic events (without border in time and space) like Cyber.\n\n## CEDED REINSURANCE\n\nThe reinsurance structure in charge of Life Health and Property & Casualty reinsurance (AXA Global Re up to mid-2022 and then Group Ceded Re) reports to the Group Chief Underwriting O/ff icer. Its main mandate is to contribute to the protection of the Group through the centralization of the Group's purchase of reinsurance.\n\nFor the Life & Health and Property & Casualty operations, reinsurance programs are set up as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Group's operating entities reinsurance capacity are set in alignment with Group Standards and with their local risk appetite limits considering the risk assessment previously described;\n- \u25a0 Their risks are modeled through in-depth actuarial analyses conducted on each portfolio. Specifically, for Property & Casualty, modelling is fully aligned with the Group economic capital model; for risks associated with the main natural perils (storms, floods, earthquakes, etc.), AXA uses several models both in-house and external; for man-made risks (including Casualty and Cyber), AXA uses in-house models.\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nCentralization and harmonization of treaty reinsurance purchase is based on the same procedures for both the Life Health businesses as for the Property & Casualty activities.\n\nIn order to build adjusted and optimized protection, the Group's operating entities are reinsured by AXA SA except for very specific cases notably for products developed in partnership with reinsurers in Life & Health and except for some AXA XL treaties.\n\nGroup Ceded Re can place a variable part of the local treaties on the reinsurance market, for regulatory reasons for example. A portion of the risk exposure is retained within AXA SA and protected through the Group covers (including through an internal pool mechanism for Property) and the remaining part is ceded to external reinsurers.\n\nGroup Ceded Re is responsible for all Group external cessions. Since the acquisition of the XL group, AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers (mainly quota share for specialties and for US portfolios) under Group Ceded Re's\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.6 INSURANCE RISKS\n\ndelegation and control. 2024 Group reinsurance protections ensure respecting the risk appetite as in 2023.\n\nThese protections consist of major Group-covers (CAT, Property Per Risk, International Liability, Marine Whole Account (incl. Marine, Energy, etc.), Cyber, and Life) and various entities' specific local covers mainly driven by AXA XL-dedicated protections ( e.g. Aviation, Marine, Energy, US Liability, Political risks, retro, etc.).\n\nThe structures of Group covers are designed to adequately protect the Group in compliance with the Group risk appetite framework. Specific proportional and non-proportional covers are arranged through either the traditional reinsurance market or alternative capital markets (Insurance Linked Securities - ILS, such as cat bonds etc.) both on an indemnity and industry loss index basis.\n\nAXA also uses alternative capital market solutions also known as Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS), such as catastrophe bonds, as part of the overall reinsurance strategy. The use of ILS may not provide the same level of protection as traditional reinsurance, and the protections provided may vary depending on the region in which the loss occurred, or the number of events that make up the loss. Like traditional reinsurance, the accessibility of the ILS market may be impacted by disruptions, volatility or uncertainty, such as those that may arise following a major catastrophic event. Also, to the extent that AXA uses ILS products providing reinsurance protections based on an industry loss index rather than on its actual incurred losses, such transactions could result in a larger or lower residual loss than anticipated.\n\nFinally, in addition to the analyses described above, the Group Security Committee regularly monitors the AXA Group credit exposures to reinsurers, to ensure that consolidated exposures remain within the Group risk tolerance (see Section 5.4 'Credit Risk - Receivables from reinsurers' of this Annual Report).\n\n## INSURANCE LIABILITIES\n\nOperational entities specifically monitor their reserve risks. Liability for incurred claims is estimated and booked on a fileby-file basis by the claims handlers. Additional liabilities are also booked by the local entities.\n\nThe additional liabilities' calculations are carried out locally by a two-independent-opinion process.\n\nActuaries in charge of assessing liabilities use various statistical and actuarial methods. Their assumptions are made following discussions with claims managers, pricing actuaries, underwriters and other specialized departments.\n\nThey notably ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 a sufficient number of operating elements have been scrutinized (including contracts, premiums and claims patterns, claims' handling, and reinsurance e/ff ects);\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Its implementation is not limited to insurance activities. It encompasses all AXA entities, including insurance companies, banking activities, AXA Investment Managers and internal service providers consistent with AXA policy on operational Risk Management.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative requirements are defined:\n\n- \u25a0 across the Group, the most critical operational risks of each entity and a set of stress scenarios are identified and assessed following a forward-looking and expert-opinion approach. These risk scenarios are then used to estimate the capital requirement needed to cover operational risks based on advanced models based on Solvency II principles. The operational Risk Management process is embedded into local governance through senior management validation to ensure that the risk assessment is adequate, appropriate and comprehensive but also to ensure that adequate corrective and pre-emptive actions are defined and implemented in respect of the main risks;\n- \u25a0 in addition, a loss data collection process is in place within most companies of the Group in order to track and appropriately mitigate actual operational risk losses. This process is also used as a valuable source of information to back-test the assumptions taken in risk assessments.\n\nA key objective of the AXA Group's operational risk economic capital model is to understand and reduce losses resulting from operational failures and to define an appropriate risk response strategy for major operational risk scenarios. Entities and Group Operational Risk profiles are presented to local/Group Risk Committees for decisions and actions to be taken.\n\nIn 2023, the Group Operational Risk Profile is reasonably well spread out with all seven operational risk categories covered and the main risks being the following:\n\n- \u25a0 transaction capture, execution and maintenance risk is a major risk and relates to process error, failure, and/or misperformance;\n- \u25a0 compliance risk due to increases in legislation and regulation remains a major concern and is under the close monitoring of Group Compliance;\n- \u25a0 external fraud & system security risk continues also to be a top priority. AXA Group's exposure to cyber risk is still high with more and more new technology into AXA Group's products and services. Information on cyber risks should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Operational and businessrelated risks' in Section 5.1 'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to operational risks is captured in the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section 5.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nSpecific actions are identified at Group and local levels to mitigate these risks. Also, the implementation of the Internal Control framework will continue to contribute to better embed controls in activities and mitigate the risks.\n\nAs regards information risks, AXA has built an Information Risk Management (IRM) framework to enable information risk decisions to be made consistently across the organization and establish sustainable Risk Management capabilities that are integrated with the business.\n\nAXA relies on third-party providers for outsourcing of services at different stages of the value chain. Although relying on partners is a strategic advantage, onboarding a vendor into AXA's organization requires AXA to assess the risks it might bring, such as regulatory, compliance, IT security, etc.\n\nTo protect both business and customers, AXA has set up a dedicated Vendor Risk Framework program co-sponsored by Group Risk Management and Group Procurement. This program is supported by Group functions (Compliance, Data Privacy, Information Security, Operational Resilience, Legal, Reputation and Internal Control) and local stakeholders (Chief Risk O/ff icers, Chief Procurement Officers and Insurance Procurement Directors).\n\nThe Vendor Risk Framework defines a set of requirements for each relationship, with a risk-based approach, i.e. existing and potential new contracts. After identification of the criticality through pre-determined criteria, an appropriate level of due diligence, minimum requirements and oversight is implemented.\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section 5.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5.7 OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n5",

The objectives of the Reputation Risk Management approach are in line with AXA's overall Enterprise Risk Management approach aiming to develop a reputation risk culture and risk intelligence.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGiven the nature of strategic risks, there is no capital charge assessment but a strong strategic Risk Management framework to anticipate and mitigate these risks. Group Risk Management is involved at early stage in major strategic projects ( e.g. large M&A projects). The Group governance standards require among other things a Risk Management second opinion on key processes, including significant transactions and strategic plans. Furthermore, the ORSA report provides an assessment on the overall solvency needs which include the Solvency II ratio projection made until the strategic plan horizon and in stress scenarios as detailed in Section 5.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management - Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)' of this Annual Report.\n\nThree main objectives drive the Reputation Risk Management approach:\n\n- \u25a0 proactively manage reputation risk, avoid or minimize negative issues impacting the reputation of AXA and build trust among all of AXA stakeholders;\n- \u25a0 define  accountability  for  reputation  risk  across  the organization, at Group and local levels;\n- \u25a0 implement a common reputation Risk Management framework throughout the organization.\n\nAXA Group monitors in near real-time potential and existing issues and receives periodic top reputation risk reports from local entities. Every two months, an informational report is submitted to the Group Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, and once a year, an internal report analyzes the main cases of reputation risk managed by AXA. Regular dialogue with the Global Reputation Network allows for building awareness, identification and dissemination of key topics that could negatively impact the Group's reputation.\n\nThe implementation of the Reputation Risk Framework encompasses AXA Group's main activities including insurance, Asset Management as well as internal service providers.",

Emerging risks are marked by a high degree of uncertainty, as some of them may never even emerge.\n\nGiven the nature of emerging risks, there is no capital charge assessment, but the AXA Group has established processes to monitor emerging risks which could develop over time and become significant. The emerging risk framework encompasses a network of circa 120 people within the AXA Group (mainly based in insurance, Asset Management and support function entities such as AXA Group Operations) which allows expertise to be shared within the business and risk communities and ensures adequate underwriting policies are defined.\n\nEmerging risks surveillance is organized through a detection process including regular monitoring of scientific publications, court decisions, etc. Risks are monitored and classified within\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Regulatory risks\n\nFor further information on the regulatory environment in which AXA Group operates including regulatory risks, please refer to the paragraph 'Regulatory-related risks' in Section 5.1 'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Sustainability risks SNFP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on the sustainability risks to which the AXA Group might be exposed, either from the perspective of the impacts on AXA's business or from the perspective of the impact of AXA's business operations, please refer to Section 4.1 'AXA\n\na risk mapping constituted of five sub-groups (environment & energy, society, regulation & politics, economy, finance & business, health & medicine, and tech & data).

AXA operates both in Europe and worldwide. The list of the main entities included in the scope of consolidation is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAXA is listed on Euronext Paris Compartiment A.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements including all Notes were set by the Board of Directors on March 13, 2024.\n\n## 1.2 GENERAL ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee that are endorsed by the European Union before the end of the reporting period with a compulsory date of January 1, 2023. Accordingly, the Group uses the option provided by the European Union which allows not to apply the annual cohort requirement under IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts for determining the groups of insurance contracts meeting some criteria (refer to paragraph 1.14.3).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.2.1 IFRS requirements adopted on January 1, 2023\n\n## 1.2.1.1 IFRS 17 - INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAXA has started applying IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments from January 1, 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, published on May 18, 2017 and amended on June 25, 2020 and on December 9, 2021, was adopted by the European Union with an exemption regarding the annual cohort requirement (refer to paragraph 1.14.3).\n\nIFRS 9 - Financial Instruments was issued on July 24, 2014 and adopted by the European Union on November 22, 2016, with the published effective date on January 1, 2018. However, amendments to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts allowed entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 to notably apply a temporary exemption from implementing IFRS 9 until the e/ff ective date of IFRS 17. In this context, the Group, eligible for this temporary exemption option, decided to defer the implementation of IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023.\n\nFinally, an amendment to IFRS 17 'Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information', issued on December 9, 2021 and endorsed by the European Union on September 8, 2022, improved requirements for the comparative information to be disclosed on initial application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. This amendment permits entities that first apply both standards at the same time to present comparative information about a financial asset as if the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 had been applied to that financial asset before. AXA decided to restate the comparative period at the first application of IFRS 9 and apply this 'classification overlay', including the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, to all eligible financial assets.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 results in significant accounting changes, with an impact on AXA's consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of profit or loss, and other comprehensive income. The nature and e/ff ects of these changes are summarized below.",

In addition, a negative accounting mismatch in OCI structurally occurs as some underlying items, notably investments in real estate properties, are accounted for at amortized cost by AXA, with therefore no recognition of unrealized gains and losses in shareholders' equity while these unrealized gains and losses are included in the value of the contracts (with a corresponding opposite e/ff ect in OCI).\n\nFurther details on these impacts are provided below for both IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. For the description of the main IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting principles applied by AXA, refer to paragraphs 1.9 to 1.10 and 1.14.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\n## Main changes resulting from the adoption of IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17  establishes  the  principles  for  the  recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts. It aims at being more economic and better reflecting the underlying profitability of the business, while increasing comparability across the industry.\n\nThe main changes in the measurement of insurance contracts under IFRS 17 compared to IFRS 4 are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the present value of future cash flows (PVFCF) is a forward looking and market consistent best estimate of future cash inflows and outflows that are now discounted;\n- \u25a0 the recognition of a risk adjustment for non-financial risk ('RA'), \u20ac3,240 million as of January 1, 2022 net of reinsurance, which reflects the compensation required by AXA for bearing\n- the uncertainty around the amount and timing of the future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk as insurance contracts are fulfilled. In this respect, the Group considers the 62.5 th -67.5 th percentile range as the adequate level of prudence on underlying insurance liabilities;\n- \u25a0 the introduction of the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM'), \u20ac33,588 million as of January 1, 2022 net of reinsurance, which represents the present value of estimated future profits attributable to the shareholders for non-onerous contracts; it is released through the statement of profit or loss over the coverage period of the contracts, as AXA provides services to policyholders;\n- \u25a0 compared to the level at which the liability adequacy test was performed under IFRS 4, the level of aggregation of the contracts under IFRS 17 is more granular and can therefore result in more contracts being identified as onerous and losses on onerous contracts being recognized in profit or loss sooner.\n\nIFRS 1 7 does not change the underlying profitability of any given insurance contract. It can only change the pattern of earnings recognition over the life of the contracts:\n\n- \u25a0 for Life & Savings, as well as for long term Protection & Health businesses, the CSM amortization profile can di/ff er from the previous timing of profit recognition under IFRS 4 and the CSM mechanism is expected to absorb small to medium technical variances and also financial variances for direct participating contracts. However, in case of significant technical or financial chocks, some group of contracts may become onerous and trigger the recognition of a loss in profit or loss;\n- \u25a0 for Property & Casualty business, the changes relative to IFRS 4 are limited and mainly linked to the discounting of all claims reserves, a more granular onerous contract testing based on facts and circumstances, and the inclusion of a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. Earnings of this line of business are more sensitive to interest rates level ( e.g. positive impact from discounting claims reserves, net of the unwind of the discount, in a rising interest rate environment).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Therefore, shadow accounting ( i.e . recognition of policyholders' participation in unrealized capital gains and losses as it was allowed by IFRS 4 for insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features) no longer applies under IFRS 17.\n\nIn respect of the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position, the other changes compared to IFRS 4 relate notably to the following:\n\n- \u25a0 intangible assets decreased as a result of the removal of Deferred Acquisition Costs ('DAC') and the value of purchased business in-force ('VBI') respectively for \u20ac17,825 million and \u20ac919 million as of January 1, 2022; these assets are henceforth implicitly embedded within the CSM under IFRS 17, goodwill was not a/ff ected by the adoption of IFRS 17;\n- \u25a0 insurance and reinsurance related receivables and payables are no longer presented separately from technical liabilities and reinsurance assets, leading to a reduction of total assets and liabilities;\n- \u25a0 policy loans, presented within the investments under IAS 39, are reclassified within insurance liabilities (refer to paragraph IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments below);\n- \u25a0 portfolios of contracts that have asset balances and those that have liability balances are presented separately on each side of the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFurthermore, in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, insurance revenue will not reflect the premiums underwritten during the year, but the premiums earned during the period, net of any investment component, corresponding to the release of the fulfilment cash flows ( i.e . the expected cash flows of the period plus the related release of risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk) and the CSM.\n\n## Transition methods\n\nThe transition to IFRS 17 involved determining the methodology to be used for measuring the insurance contracts in force at the transition date, which is the beginning of the annual reporting period immediately preceding the date of initial application, namely January 1, 2022.\n\nTheoretically, the transition from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17 requires applying the new standard fully retrospectively, as if it was applied from the inception of insurance contracts in force.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nHowever, if the application of this full retrospective approach ('FRA') is impracticable, the two following options are possible:\n\n- \u25a0 either the modified retrospective approach ('MRA'), which consists  in  applying  certain  modifications  of  general requirements, to the extent that the full retrospective application is impracticable, but still with the objective to achieve the outcome as close as possible to the retrospective application, based on reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost and e/ff ort;\n- \u25a0 or  the  fair  value  approach  ('FVA'),  which  consists  in repricing the contracts in the light of actuarial and financial parameters seen at the transition date by calculating the CSM as the positive di/ff erence between (i) the fair value of liabilities determined in accordance with IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement (1) , corresponding to the price that would be required by an external party to acquire the liabilities, and (ii) the fulfilment cash flows of insurance contracts.\n\nIn practice, the Group has applied the FRA only to the liabilities for remaining coverage ('LRC') of insurance contracts measured using the Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA') and the liabilities for incurred claims ('LIC') occurred since 2016.\n\nFor the other groups of insurance contracts, di/ff erent factors (such as the impossibility of running models since the inception of the contracts, the unavailability of yield curves, the lack of historical data) have made the application of the FRA impracticable. For these groups of contracts, AXA has applied the MRA or the FVA, namely:\n\n- \u25a0 for long-t erm Life & Savings contracts, the MRA was the most broadly used approach, which mainly consisted in calculating an approximate CSM by reusing past information coming from European Embedded Value ('EEV') or Solvency II, and the analyses of movements leading to get results close to those that would have been obtained using a FRA, the FVA being applied only on a more limited basis;\n- \u25a0 for LIC occurred before 2016 related to non-direct participating contracts, in the absence of reasonable and supportable information (under IFRS 4, claims reserves were generally not discounted and determining the correct locked-in discount yield curves was not possible without hindsight for periods before the adoption of Solvency II), the FVA was applied with the option taken to set the OCI to zero on transition ( i.e . discounting the liabilities with the transition yield curve instead of an historical accident year yield curve). In the context of the application of this option, an estimate of OCI for financial assets related to these LIC is disclosed in Note 11.2.3.",

For LIC occurred before 2016 for which the Group applied the FVA, average yield curves were not applicable.\n\n- \u25a0 CSM at transition date of groups of insurance contracts not applying the annual cohort requirement\n\nInsurance contracts in force at transition eligible to the exemption provided by the European Union not to apply the IFRS 17 annual cohort requirement (refer to paragraph 1.14.3) were all measured at transition applying the MRA or FVA. A/f\\_t er transition, the adoption of this exemption by AXA (which mostly concerns contracts applying the Variable Fee Approach), leads\n\nto mix contracts in force at transition with those generated by the new business underwritten from 2022, in a unique group of contracts.\n\nFor these contracts which were in force at transition date,  the following table provides the expected timing of recognition in profit or loss of the CSM such as reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2022, split by transition method. This pattern of recognition only reflects expected coverage units which do not consider the future expected accretion of the CSM arising from the expected return on assets for contracts measured applying the Variable Fee Approach. For this reason, the table below does not reflect the expected release of the CSM that will be reported in the statement of profit or loss in the coming years for these contracts.\n\n| (in  Euro   million)            | 1 year or  less   | 1 - 2 years   | 2 - 3 years   | 3 - 4 years   | 4 - 5 years   | 5 - 10  years   | More than  10 years   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Full retrospective approach     | 0                 | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0               | 0                     | 0       |\n| Modified retrospective approach | 1,243             | 1,100         | 1,001         | 922           | 856           | 3,479           | 7,517                 | 16,118  |\n| Fair value approach             | 427               | 382           | 356           | 334           | 313           | 1,277           | 3,279                 | 6,367   |\n| TOTAL                           | 1,671             | 1,481         | 1,357         | 1,256         | 1,169         | 4,756           | 10,795                | 22,486  |\n\n## IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments\n\nIFRS 9 - Financial Instruments provides accounting requirements related to the classification and measurement of financial instruments and replaces IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are applied retrospectively, excluding the changes in hedge accounting that are applied prospectively from January 1, 2023, with the exception of the 'cost of hedging approach' (see below) applied retrospectively. The comparative period has been restated.\n\nThe main changes in the Group's accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9, as well as their e/ff ects on the Group's consolidated financial statements, are disclosed below.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nOn adoption of IFRS 9, the previous IAS 39 categories of financial assets are replaced by the IFRS 9 classification categories based on how financial assets are subsequently measured (at cost, at fair value through other comprehensive value ('FV OCI') or at fair value through profit or loss ('FV P&L')) and determined depending on both the business model in which\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6",

The new IFRS 9 classification requirements notably led to reclassifying some debt instruments and nonconsolidated investment funds from FV OCI to FV P&L (see the tables below).\n\nRegarding the classification options for financial assets, IFRS 9:\n\n- \u25a0 narrows the scope of the optional designation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss by limiting it to the only situations when doing so eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise from measuring those financial assets at amortized cost or at FV OCI;\n- \u25a0 introduces the optional FV OCI designation for qualifying investments in equity instruments, referred to as 'FV OCI without recycling'; and\n- \u25a0 provides an option to designate a credit exposure as measured at FV P&L when an entity uses a credit derivative measured at FV P&L to manage the credit risk of this credit exposure.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAnother change compared to IAS 39 lies in derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts that are not separated when the host is a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification applying the general IFRS 9 approach for financial assets.\n\nThe approach applied by the Group to classify and measure its financial investments under IFRS 9 is detailed in paragraph 1.9.2.1.\n\nMost of the Group's financial assets are measured at fair value both before and after transition to IFRS 9, and most of the debt instruments accounted for at FV OCI under IAS 39 (debt instruments available for sale) continue to be accounted for at FV OCI under IFRS 9. The new classification and measurement requirements however resulted in the changes detailed herea/f\\_t er.\n\nThe following table sets out the reclassifications from the original categories under IAS 39 to the new categories under IFRS 9 for each class of financial assets included in investments from insurance activities and investments from banking and other activities in the Group's consolidated statement of financial position as at January 1, 2022.",

The total carrying value of equity instruments designated at FV OCI without recycling represented \u20ac22,313 million (of which \u20ac4,207 million of net unrealized gains accumulated in OCI);\n- \u25a0 some loans, accounted for at amortized cost under IAS 39, for a total of \u20ac4,569 million, were designated at FV P&L under IFRS 9 applying the fair value option in order to eliminate or significantly reduce accounting mismatches in profit or loss, leading to recognize unrealized capital gains for \u20ac387 million in retained earnings;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 some d ebt instruments, for a total of \u20ac1,312 million, were reclassified from FV P&L to FV OCI; cumulated changes in fair value of those debt instruments are no longer recognized in profit or loss but in OCI. A fair value gain of \u20ac111 million would have been recognized in profit or loss in 2022 if those debt instruments had not been reclassified; the int erest revenue on these instruments recognized in profit or loss under IFRS 9 in the 2022 restated Consolidated Financial Statements, amounted to \u20ac13 million.\n\nThe following table sets out the reclassifications from the original categories under IAS 39 to the new categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the Group's financial assets as at January 1, 2023.",

Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group's IFRS 9 impairment approach is detailed in paragraph 1.9.2.2.\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation between the balances of cumulated impairment allowances under IAS 39 and cumulated ECL allowances under IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2022.\n\n## RECONCILIATION OF IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS (IAS 39 VERSUS IFRS 9) AS OF JANUARY 1, 2022\n\n| (in Euro million)                                                         | Impairment  allowance under  IAS 39   | IFRS 9  remeasurement   | ECL allowance  under IFRS 9   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Debt instruments                                                          | (32)                                  | (64)                    | (96)                          |\n| FV OCI (Available for Sale) IAS 39/FV OCI IFRS 9                          | (31)                                  | (52)                    | (83)                          |\n| FV OCI (Available for Sale) IAS 39/FV P&L - Mandatory IFRS 9              | (1)                                   | 1                       | (0)                           |\n| Amortized Cost (Loans & Receivables) IAS 39/Amortized Cost IFRS 9         | (0)                                   | (13)                    | (13)                          |\n| Equity instruments                                                        | (2,403)                               | 2,403                   | -                             |\n| FV OCI (Available for Sale) IAS 39/FV OCI without recycling to P&L IFRS 9 | (2,403)                               | 2,403                   | -                             |\n| Non controlled investment funds                                           | (928)                                 | 928                     | -                             |\n| FV OCI (Available for Sale) IAS 39/FV P&L - Mandatory IFRS 9              | (928)                                 | 928                     | -                             |\n| Loans                                                                     | (177)                                 | (20)                    | (197)                         |\n| Amortized Cost (Loans & Receivables) IAS 39/Amortized Cost IFRS 9         | (176)                                 | (21)                    | (197)                         |\n| Amortized Cost (Loans & Receivables) IAS 39/FV P&L - Mandatory IFRS 9     | (1)                                   | 1                       | -                             |\n| TOTAL                                                                     | (3,541)                               | 3,247                   | (293)                         |\n\nThe application of the new IFRS 9 impairment requirements generates the following impacts on the Group's opening consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2022:\n\n- \u25a0 for FV OCI equity instruments, unlike IAS 39, no impairment is required under IFRS 9. As mentioned above, AXA applies the optional designation at FV OCI without recycling for most of equity securities held. As a consequence of this designation, the cumulated amount of IAS 39 impairment allowances, \u20ac2,403 million, was transferred from retained earnings to OCI without recycling, with no impact on the Group's total consolidated shareholders' equity;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 for non-consolidated investment funds reclassified from FV OCI to FV P&L, the cumulated amount of IAS 39 impairment allowances, \u20ac928 million, was removed without any impact on the Group's retained earnings;\n- \u25a0 for debt instruments and loans measured at FV OCI or at cost under both IAS 39 and IFRS 9, the application of new impairment requirements results in limited additional impairment allowances (\u20ac86 million).\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation between the balances of cumulated impairment allowances under IAS 39 and cumulated ECL allowances under IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2023.",

This requirement is not applicable for the financial liabilities arising from investment contracts with no discretionary participation features (refer to paragraph 1.15).\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhen first applying IFRS 9, an entity may make an accounting policy choice to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39, instead of those in IFRS 9. AXA decided to apply IFRS 9 requirements for all hedges with the exception of portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk (commonly referred to as 'fair value macro hedges'). For the latter, AXA continues applying the hedge accounting requirements currently in IAS 39 as allowed by the IASB that is addressing macro hedge accounting as a separate project.\n\nIFRS 9 establishes a more principle-based approach for the general hedge accounting model and aligns hedge accounting more closely with Risk Management.\n\nIn particular, IFRS 9 introduces the possibility to apply prospectively from January 1, 2023 the hedge accounting for fair value hedges of equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI, that implies to record in OCI, without recycling into profit or loss, the changes in fair value of both the hedged equity instrument and the derivative.\n\nIn addition, IFRS 9 provides a new accounting mechanism, applicable retrospectively from January 1, 2023, designed to reduce the volatility in profit or loss and referred to as 'cost of hedging approach', for the situations where only a part of a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument (for example, changes in intrinsic value of a purchased option or changes in the spot element of a forward contract).\n\nIFRS 9 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge relationships applied by AXA is detailed in paragraph 1.10.\n\nMost Group's hedge accounting relationships documented under IAS 39 are considered as continuing hedge relationships under IFRS 9 with the exception of  those implying derivative instruments belonging to underlying items of direct participating contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, as no accounting mismatch exists any longer in this case.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Thus, for each line of assets or liabilities concerned, a net economic position was presented.\n\nTogether with the first application of IFRS 9, AXA has decided to modify the presentation of its derivative instruments to display them in separate lines of its consolidated statement of financial position, as either an asset or a liability depending upon the fair value position at the reporting date, with no o/ff setting.\n\nIn the restated Group's consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2022, the derivative assets and liabilities lines represented respectively \u20ac9,107 million and \u20ac11,112 million, the net balance of \u20ac2,005 million mostly resulting from derivatives previously classified within the investments.\n\n## 1.2.1.2 OTHER IFRS AMENDMENTS ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2023\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes published on May 7, 2021 narrow the scope of the exemption from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets. This exemption no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. These amendments mainly concern lease transactions of the Group. As a result, on initial recognition of a lease, AXA needs to assess the tax bases of the right-of-use and the lease liability by identifying the amounts attributable to them for tax purposes. Then, if the taxable and the deductible temporary di/ff erences are equal, a deferred tax liability related to the right-of-use and a deferred tax asset related to the lease liability are recognized. The cumulative e/ff ect of initially applying these amendments\n\nI\n\nI\n\ntotaled \u20ac14 million and was recognized as a positive adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2023 in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12: International tax reform Pillar Two model rules\n\nThe international tax reform released by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), known as Pillar Two, aims to ensure that an e/ff ective taxation of 15% is reached in each jurisdiction where multinational groups operate. This tax reform will be e/ff ective in France starting for the 2024 fiscal year. As a result, the Group will have to determine the e/ff ective tax rate based on Pillar Two rules in each jurisdiction where it operates, and, if it is lower than the minimum 15% rate, an additional tax will have to be paid.\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes issued by the IASB on May 23, 2023 and endorsed by the European Union on November 8, 2023, introduce a mandatory temporary exception in IAS 12, prohibiting both the recognition and disclosure of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities that arise from the implementation of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. AXA has applied this exception in its 2023 consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese amendments also introduce some disclosure requirements for a/ff ected entities. Indeed, when the tax legislation is e/ff ective in a specific jurisdiction, the current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two will have to be disclosed separately.\n\nThe Group has initiated a specific project in 2023 to implement Pillar Two model rules. Based on the analysis in progress, main jurisdictions where the Group may have an exposure are Ireland, Hong Kong and Bermuda. As for Bermuda, a local corporate income tax of 15% has been enacted on December 27, 2023. This tax will be e/ff ective for fiscal years beginning on or a/f\\_t er January 1, 2025. In this context, the Group expects to pay a",

In this respect, goodwill (in particular impairment tests described in paragraph 1.8.1), other intangible assets acquired in a business combination, certain assets accounted for at fair value, deferred tax assets, assets and liabilities relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts, pension benefit obligations and balances related to share-based compensation, are the financial statements main items for which the measurement methods, along with key assumptions where required, are discussed in greater depth in the notes relating to the asset and liability items concerned where meaningful and useful.\n\nAs recommended by IAS 1, assets and liabilities are generally classified globally in the consolidated statement of financial position in increasing order of liquidity, which is more relevant for financial institutions than a classification between current and non-current items.\n\nAll amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in Euro million, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## 1.3 PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## 1.3.1 Scope and basis of consolidation\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises control are subsidiaries. They are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to AXA. Under IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements, AXA controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Only substantive rights ( i.e . the holder must have the practicability to exercise them) and rights that are not protective shall be considered. AXA can have power with less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, in particular through:\n\n- \u25a0 the proportion of ownership with regards to the other investors;\n- \u25a0 potential voting rights ;\n- \u25a0 a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders;\n- \u25a0 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or\n- \u25a0 a combination of these indicators.\n\nUnder IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements, companies over which AXA exercises a joint controlling influence alongside one or more third parties are joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. Under IAS 28\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, significant influence is presumed when AXA directly or indirectly holds 20% or more of the voting rights. Significant influence can also be exercised through an agreement with other shareholders.\n\nUnder the equity method, AXA's share in equity investments' post-acquisition profit or loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss, and its share in post-acquisition movements in reserves is stated under 'Other reserves'.\n\nInvestment funds and real estate companies are either fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method, depending on which conditions of IFRS 10/IFRS 11/IAS 28 listed above they satisfy. Fees received by asset managers are also taken into account in the assessment of the exposure to variability of returns. For fully consolidated investment funds, minority interests are recognized at fair value and shown as liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position, if the companies' instruments can be redeemed at any time by the holder at fair value. Investment funds accounted for using the equity method are shown under the caption 'Financial investments'.\n\nSome companies in which AXA exercises control, a joint controlling influence or significant influence, are excluded from the scope of consolidation as they are not material with respect to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. These are mainly investment funds.\n\n## 1.3.2 Business combinations and subsequent changes in the Group ownership interest\n\nIn accordance with the option made available by IFRS 1 - Firsttime adoption of IFRS, business combinations prior to 2004 were not restated with respect to French accounting principles in force at the time.\n\n## 1.3.2.1 CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nThe consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, the liabilities incurred by the Group to former owners of the acquiree and the equity instruments issued by the Group.\n\nPurchase consideration includes any contingent element (adjustment in the acquisition price conditional upon one or more events). In the estimate of the contingent element, attention is paid to use assumptions that are consistent with those used for the valuation of intangible assets. For business combinations that occurred before January 1, 2009, any contingent element was included in the cost of the combination to the extent the adjustment was probable and could be measured reliably. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination continues to be adjusted accordingly, taking account the impact in terms of additional goodwill and/or adjustments of the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. For business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, any change to the estimate of the contingent element between the acquisition date and the amount actually subsequently paid is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.",

The excess of the consideration paid or received over the fulfilment cash flows adjusts goodwill for the contracts measured using the PAA and the CSM for other contracts;\n- \u25a0 in case of onerous groups of contracts, the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage is determined on initial recognition applying the approach described in paragraph 1.14.5, and the excess of the fulfilment cash flows over the consideration paid or received is recognized as a part of the goodwill;\n- \u25a0 an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows is recognized as  at  the  acquisition  date  following  the  guidance  in paragraph 1.14.5.\n\nGroups of insurance contracts acquired in their settlement period are, if material, valuated as if they were new insurance contracts issued by the acquirer as at the acquisition date: the LRC are recognized for such insurance contracts using the General Measurement Model described in paragraph 1.14.5, with the consideration received used as a proxy for the premiums received. Subsequently, the whole amount of the LRC recognized for the acquired claim settlement liabilities is recycled in the insurance revenue over the coverage period applying the mechanism described in paragraph 1.19.1.\n\nContrary to direct participating insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, investment contracts with no discretionary participation features\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nare financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9. These liabilities are measured at their fair value which cannot be lower than surrender value when those contracts contain a surrender option.\n\n## Identifiable intangible assets\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and may include:\n\n- \u25a0 marketing-related intangible assets (trademarks, tradenames, internet domain names, non-competition agreements);\n- \u25a0 the value of customer relationships relating to future insurance contracts, including (i) expected renewals of existing contracts (excluding any related asset for insurance acquisition cash flows to be separately recognized), considering cancellations by policyholders and a definite life due to the regular decline in renewals over the passage of time, (ii) expected cross-selling with current policyholders, and (iii) expected other new contracts on customer lists (identified possible customers who have not yet a contract with the entity). These projections include assumptions regarding claims, expenses and financial revenues, or they can be estimated on the basis of the New Business Value.\n\nThe nature of the intangible assets recognized in a business combination is consistent with the valuation methods used when purchasing the acquired entity.\n\nTo the extent that the intangible assets above can be estimated separately, they can also be measured by looking at the purchased marketing resources that will allow to generate these future cash flows.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nIn the context of a business combination, only restructuring costs that can be measured reliably and which correspond to a liability of the acquired company existing prior to the acquisition date are included in restructuring provisions recognized in the statement of financial position of the acquired company at acquisition date.\n\n## 1.3.2.3 NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE ACQUIREE\n\nAccording to a decision taken for each acquisition, minority interests may be measured at fair value or at its proportionate interest in the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nIn step acquisitions, previous minority interests held by the Group are measured at fair value and the resulting adjustment is recognized through profit or loss. Similarly, when an additional purchase changes the control from significant influence or joint control to control, any investment pre-existing in a former associate/joint venture is re-measured to its fair value with the gain or loss through profit or loss (consequently also resulting in a new goodwill).\n\n## 1.3.2.4 GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of (i) the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any minority interest in\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In this case, comparative information is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.\n\nIf, a/f\\_t  er the period of twelve months, a deferred tax asset, initially considered as not recoverable, finally meets the recognition criteria, the corresponding tax benefit is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss without a corresponding adjustment in goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash generating units corresponding to (i) the companies acquired or portfolios of business acquired according to their expected profitability, and (ii) the entities already within the AXA Group that will benefit from the synergies of the combination with the activities acquired. This allocation of goodwill is used for both segment reporting and impairment testing (refer to paragraph 1.8.1).\n\n## 1.3.2.5 PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS IN A CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY\n\nPurchase and sale transactions of minority interests in a controlled subsidiary that do not change the conclusion of control are recorded through shareholders' equity (including direct acquisition costs).\n\nIf control in a subsidiary is lost, any gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Furthermore, if an investment in the entity is retained by the Group, it is re-measured to its fair value and any gain or loss is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.3.2.6 PUT OVER MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nWhen control over a subsidiary is acquired, a put option may be granted to minority shareholders. However, the recognition of the puttable instruments as a liability depends on the contractual obligations.\n\nWhen the contract involves an unconditional commitment exercisable by the option holder, it is recognized as a liability. Since the balancing entry to this liability is not specified by current IFRS, the Group's method is to (i) reclassify minority interests from equity to liability, (ii) re-measure this liability at the present value of the option price, and (iii) recognize the difference either as an increase in goodwill for puts existing\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbefore January 1, 2009, or as a decrease in equity (Group share) for a put granted a/f\\_t er January 1, 2009, to the extent there is no immediate transfer of risks and rewards. Similarly, subsequent changes in the liability are recorded against goodwill for puts existing before January 1, 2009, and against equity (Group share) for puts granted a/f\\_t er that date.\n\n## 1.3.2.7 INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS\n\nIntra-group transactions, including internal dividends, payables/ receivables and gains/losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated:\n\n- \u25a0 in full for controlled subsidiaries; and\n- \u25a0 to the extent of AXA's interest for entities accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe e/ff  ect on profit or loss of transactions between consolidated entities is always eliminated. However, in case of a loss, an impairment test is performed, in order to assess whether an impairment of the underlying item has to be booked.\n\nIn the event of an internal sale of an asset that is not intended to be held on the long term by the Group, deferred tax is recognized as the current tax calculated on the realized gain or loss is eliminated.\n\nIn addition, the transfer of consolidated shares, between two consolidated subsidiaries but held with different ownership percentages, should not impact the profit or loss. The only exception would be any related tax recorded in connection to the transaction, which is maintained in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These transfers also have an impact on Group shareholders' equity (with a balancing entry recorded in minority interests). This impact is identified in the 'other' changes of the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.\n\n## 1.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Euro million, the Euro being the Group's presentational currency.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency ( i.e . the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) di/ff erent from the Group presentational currency are translated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 assets and liabilities of entities in a functional currency di/ff  erent from Euro are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- \u25a0 revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the period, except for revenues and expenses of the entities operating in hyperinflationary economies which are translated at the closing exchange rate as explained in paragraph 1.5;",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 all resulting foreign exchange di/ff erences are recognized as a separate component of equity (translation di/ff erences).\n\nAt the local entity level, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at closing rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. When currency risk relating to such monetary items is hedged using derivative instruments as described in paragraph 1.10, changes in fair value of those derivative instruments are recognized in profit or loss and therefore o/ff set most of the translation di/ff erence relating to monetary items.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from monetary financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('OCI') are recognized as income or expense for the period in respect of the portion corresponding to amortized cost. The residual translation di/ff erences relating to fair value changes are recorded in OCI, like for non-monetary items such as equity securities designated at fair value through OCI without recycling.\n\nThe groups of insurance contracts that generate cash flows in one or several foreign currencies are treated as monetary items, which requires translating their carrying amounts at the end of the reporting period into the functional currency using the closing rate.\n\nWhen measuring a multi-currency group of contracts (including the Contractual Service Margin - refer to paragraph 1.14.5), the entities determine on initial recognition whether the group is denominated in a single currency or in the multiple currencies of the cash flows within the group, the methodology having to be applied consistently for similar transactions:\n\n- \u25a0 under a single-currency denomination policy, the changes in exchange rates between the currencies of the cash flows and the currency of the group of contracts correspond to a financial risk accounted for applying IFRS 17 whereas the changes in exchange rates between the currency of the group of contracts and the functional currency are accounted for applying IAS 21 - The E/ff ects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates;\n- \u25a0 under a multi-currency denomination policy, all changes in exchange rates are exchange di/ff erences that are accounted for applying IAS 21.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraph 1.3.2.4, goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, borrowings and other currency instruments qualifying for hedge accounting of such investment are recorded in shareholders' equity under translation differences and are recycled in the statement of profit or loss as part of the realized gain or loss on disposal of the hedged net investment.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nRegarding the cumulative amount of the exchange di/ff erences related to disposed business, the Group applies the step-by-step consolidation method (IFRIC 16).\n\n## 1.5 HYPERINFLATION ACCOUNTING\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS 29  -  Financial  Reporting  in Hyperinflationary Economy, financial statements of the entities operating in hyperinflationary economies are adjusted to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of their functional currency. Thus, non-monetary assets and liabilities of these entities which are not already expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period are restated to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index ('CPI').\n\nThe e/ff ect of inflation on monetary assets and liabilities over the reporting period is included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss of the reporting period as a gain or loss on net monetary position. The cumulated gains and losses on net monetary position for previous periods are included within the retained earnings.\n\nAll items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income need to be restated by applying the change in the CPI between the dates when those items were initially recorded in the financial statements and the end of the reporting period.\n\nTo be included in the Group's consolidated financial statements, financial statements of hyperinflationary entities, restated for hyperinflation as described above, are translated in Euros at the closing exchange rate.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of financial position as at the reporting date, the restatement effects on equity items are included in other comprehensive income, altogether with the translation di/ff erences, to the extent that the change in the CPI is correlated with movements in the exchange rate between the functional currency of the entity and Euros.\n\nThe Turkish economy is considered to be hyperinflationary in accordance with the criteria in IAS 29. By consequence, the financial statements of the Turkish consolidated entities are incorporated in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements applying the hyperinflation accounting. However, the presentation of the consolidated statement of profit or loss is not restated as the e/ff ect of the restatement is not material.\n\n## 1.6 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group applies the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement as described below for all assets and liabilities where another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurement in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles below address mostly assets given the nature of the activities of the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Liquidity for debt instruments is assessed using a multicriteria approach including the number of quotes available, the place of issuance and the evolution of the widening of bid ask spreads.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities traded on active markets is determined using quoted market prices when available. For financial instruments traded in active markets, quotes received from external pricing services represent consensus prices, i.e . using similar models and inputs resulting in a very limited dispersion.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities for which fair value is determined in whole directly by reference to an active market is disclosed as level 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 1.6.2 Assets and liabilities not quoted in an active market\n\nAn asset or liability is regarded as not quoted in an active market:\n\n- \u25a0 if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the asset or the liability;\n- \u25a0 when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity;\n- \u25a0 in case of significant illiquidity;\n- \u25a0 if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions.\n\nCharacteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the asset or the liability, or indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market is estimated using:\n\n- \u25a0 external and independent pricing services; or\n- \u25a0 valuation techniques.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market mainly based on observable market data are disclosed as level 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those which are mainly not based on observable market data are disclosed as level 3.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.6.2.1 NO ACTIVE MARKET: USE OF EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICES\n\nExternal pricing services may be fund asset managers in the case of non-consolidated investments in funds or brokers. To the extent possible, the Group collects quotes from external pricing providers as inputs to measure fair value. Prices received may form tight clusters or dispersed quotes which may then lead to the use of valuation techniques. The dispersion of quotes received may be an indication of the large range of assumptions used by external pricing providers given the limited number of transactions to be observed or reflect the existence of distress transactions.\n\n## 1.6.2.2 NO ACTIVE MARKET: USE OF VALUATION TECHNIQUES\n\nThe objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants (a willing buyer and a willing seller) at the measurement date. Valuation techniques include:\n\n- \u25a0 market approach: the consideration of recent prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving substantially similar assets or liabilities;\n- \u25a0 income approach: use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other present value techniques to convert future amounts to a single current ( i.e . discounted) amount;\n- \u25a0 cost approach: the consideration of amounts that would currently be required to construct or replace the service capacity of an asset.\n\nValuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgment is involved in establishing fair values. They include recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable willing parties on similar assets if available and representative of fair value and involve various assumptions regarding the underlying price, yield curve, correlations, volatility, default rates and other factors. Unlisted equity instruments valuation is based on cross checks using di/ff erent methodologies such as discounted cash flows techniques, price-earnings ratio multiples, adjusted net asset values, taking into account recent transactions on instruments which are substantially the same if concluded at arm's length between knowledgeable willing parties, if any. The use of valuation techniques and assumptions could produce di/ff erent estimates of fair value. However, valuations are determined using generally accepted models (discounted cash flows, Black & Scholes models, etc.) based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or underlyings (index, credit spread, etc.) whenever such directly observable data are available and valuations are adjusted for liquidity and credit risk.",

        "page_content": "Valuation techniques may be used when there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the market, when quotes made available by external pricing providers are too dispersed or when market conditions are so dislocated that observed data cannot be used or need significant adjustments. Internal mark to model valuations are, therefore, either normal market practices for certain assets and liabilities inherently scarcely traded or exceptional processes implemented due to specific market conditions.\n\nWhen valuation technics are used, the classification between levels 2 and 3 depends on the proportion of assumptions supported by observable market data used by external pricing services or, in very limited cases, by the Group.\n\n## 1.6.2.3 USE OF VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN DISLOCATED MARKETS\n\nThe dislocation of certain markets may be evidenced by various factors. For example, a very large widening of bid ask spreads may be a helpful indicator in understanding whether market participants are willing to transact. The dislocation of markets may also be suspected in case of wide dispersion in the prices (over time or among market participants), small number of transactions, closing down of primary and/or secondary markets, forced transactions motivated by needs of liquidity or other di/ff icult financial conditions with insu/ff icient time to market the assets to be sold, and large bulk sales to exit such markets at all costs that may involve side arrangements (such as sellers providing finance for a sale to a buyer).\n\nIn such cases, the Group uses valuation techniques including observable data whenever possible and relevant, adjusted if needed to develop the best estimate of fair value, including adequate risk premiums, or develops a valuation model based on unobservable data representing estimates of assumptions that willing market participants would use when prices are not current, relevant or available without undue costs and e/ff orts: in inactive markets, transactions may be inputs when measuring fair value, but would likely not be determinative and unobservable data may be more appropriate than observable inputs.\n\n## 1.7 SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe segmental analysis provided in AXA's Consolidated Financial Statements reflects six operating business segments. These segments are determined on the basis of geographies or transversally for entities operating in various jurisdictions, and include 'France', 'Europe', 'AXA XL', 'Asia, Africa & EME-LATAM (1) ', 'AXA Investment Managers' and 'Transversal & Other' segments.\n\n## 1.8 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 1.8.1 Goodwill and impairment of goodwill\n\nGoodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized but subject to a regular test for impairment. Impairment tests are performed at least annually. Impairment of goodwill is not reversible.\n\nAXA performs an impairment test of goodwill by cash generating unit, using valuation approaches that rely on parameters such as market indicators, market value of assets, market value of liabilities and future operating profits, derived on the basis of operational and economic assumptions in order to determine any significant adverse changes that might lead to the nonrecoverability of goodwill. Compliant with IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets, within each cash generating unit, a comparison is made between the net book value and the recoverable value (equal to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use).\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for a cash generating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit or group of units is lower than the carrying amount of the unit or group of units.\n\nValue in use consists of the net assets and the value placed on expected future earnings from existing and new business. Fair value less costs to sell is determined in compliance with IFRS 13 as described in paragraph 1.6.\n\nFor Life business, the fair value approach is based on risk neutral valuation techniques applied to future cashflows. The fair value is made of:\n\n- \u25a0 the current shareholders' net IFRS asset value (excluding intangible assets net of taxes and subordinated debt);\n- \u25a0 the profitability of the business in force, represented by the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM'), determined by projecting the expected margins from the in force portfolio of insurance contracts until the end of their coverage period; and\n- \u25a0 the profitability of future new business, computed on the basis of multiples of the New Business Value ('IFRS17 NBV') which corresponds to a standardized year of new business contribution (present value of projected future distributable profits generated from the business written in the current year). The determination of the future earnings arising from the new business relies upon the use of operational, technical and economic assumptions, all of which are compliant with the requirements of the di/ff erent regulatory frameworks and regularly reviewed by independent parties.\n\nThe recoverable value of the Life business is first assessed on a risk free basis (consistent with fair value) and then on the basis of market assumptions aligned with a Real World valuation (value in use) if the recoverable value determined on a risk free basis is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nFor the Property & Casualty business, the recoverable value is built upon cash flow projections based on the business plans (using IFRS principles) which are approved by AXA management, and discounted using a risk adjusted rate (value in use). Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate and a terminal value.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

If these assets have a finite useful life, they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. In all cases, they are subject to impairment tests, at each closing date for assets with a finite useful life and at least annually for other assets. In the event of a significant decline in value, an impairment is booked corresponding to the di/ff erence between the carrying value and the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell;\n- \u25a0 Deferred Origination Costs ('DOC') correspond to the deferred contract costs (such as incremental costs of obtaining a contract or costs directly related to fulfilling a contract) of investment contracts with no discretionary participation features (refer to paragraph 1.15) but with an investment management service. They are amortized by taking into account projections of fees collected over the life of the contracts. The amortization of DOC is reviewed at each closing date to reflect changes in assumptions and experience. These assets are also tested for recoverability. As DOC are reported gross of unearned fees reserves, these unearned fees reserves are separately recognized as liabilities and are amortized over the contract term using the same amortization approach as the one used for DOC.\n\n## 1.9 INVESTMENTS FROM INSURANCE, BANKING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nInvestments from insurance activities (including assets backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders) and investments from banking and other activities cover investments in real estate properties and financial investments.\n\nInvestments backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are presented in a separate aggregate of the statement of financial position as a part of investments from insurance activities. This presentation is considered more relevant for the users and consistent with the liquidity order recommended by IAS 1 for financial institutions, since the risks are borne by policyholders, whatever the type of assets backing liabilities (investments in real estate properties, debt instruments or equity instruments, etc.).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.9.1 Investments in real estate properties\n\nInvestments in real estate properties include buildings and assimilated assets (such as infrastructures) owned directly or through consolidated real estate entities.\n\nAll investments in real estate properties ( including those totally or partially backing liabilities arising from insurance or investment contracts measured using the Variable Fee Approach described in paragraph 1.14.7) are recognized at cost. The properties components are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, also considering their residual value if it may be reliably estimated.\n\nIn case of unrealized loss over 15%, an impairment is recognized for the di/ff erence between the net book value of the investment property and the fair value of the asset (determined as described below) based on an independent valuation. Furthermore, at the level of each reporting entity, if the cumulated amount of unrealized losses under 15% (without o/ff setting with unrealized gains) represents more than 10% of the cumulated net cost of real estate assets, additional impairment is booked on a line-byline approach until the 10% threshold is reached.\n\nIf, in subsequent periods, the appraisal value rises to at least 15% more than the net carrying value, previously recorded impairment is reversed to the extent of the di/ff erence between (i) the net carrying value and (ii) the lower of the appraisal value and the depreciated cost (before impairment).\n\nThe fair value of investments in real estate properties generally cannot be determined via reference to quotes of an active market from an exchange market or service provider. Instead, AXA real estate properties are valued by qualified independent appraisers with relevant professional qualification and experience in the locations and segments of the properties to be valued. These external real estate valuation experts are members of one of the professional organizations composing the Internal Valuation Standard Council (IVSC).\n\nExternal valuations are performed at least annually except for Switzerland, where they are conducted every five years (internal valuations being however performed annually).\n\nExternal real estate valuation experts generally use a primary valuation method to value real estate properties held by AXA, and additionally provide a value derived from a second method for verification. When relevant, an average value between the two valuation methods is retained. As the primary valuation method has to be applied consistently from one period to another, any change need to be justified.\n\nFive main valuation methods may apply to determine the fair value of AXA real estate assets (the first two ones being the most used):\n\n- \u25a0 the discounted cash flow method determines the value of the real estate property from its potential to generate future income. Thus, the value is estimated by compiling the net present value of the future cash flows. Main inputs for the valuation are: projected rental income, projected operating",

The Group provides external appraisers with all relevant information (notably detailed rent rolls, budget, etc.) to enable them to determine future cash flows, to which they also apply their own assumptions. The discount rate and exit yield applied vary from one property to another since they are combination of the risk-free rate and the risk premium attached to each property due to its location, quality, size, and technical specificities;\n\n- \u25a0 the income capitalization method determines the value of the real estate property by applying a capitalization rate at the net operating income at perpetuity. The income capitalization method can notably be used when cash flows are stable and relatively certain, mainly where the real estate asset is fully leased (with limited number of tenants) and/or no occupancy changes are expected. In that case, it may not be necessary to consider an explicit forecast period such as used under the discounted cash flow methodology and a terminal value may form the only basis for value;\n- \u25a0 the Hardcore method is a variation of the income capitalization method and determines the value of the real estate property by applying a di/ff erent capitalization rate at the net operating income depending on the type of income;\n- \u25a0 the comparable transactions method uses information on recent transactions, involving real estate properties that are identical or substantially similar, to derive a  price;\n- \u25a0 the residual method can be used for properties or land with development potential when the fair value can be considered as reliably determinable. It consists in determining the residual value of the development property which represents the anticipated value of the project when completed a/f\\_t er deducting all known or anticipated costs required to complete the development.\n\nSpecific risks (such as climate, regulatory, legal risks,..) on real estate property are reflected in the exit yield or discount rate used in the modelling by the external appraiser.\n\n## 1.9.2 Financial investments\n\n## 1.9.2.1 CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nFinancial assets held by AXA include notably debt instruments, equity instruments, loans, receivables and investments in nonconsolidated investments funds. These instruments are held directly or through controlled investment funds.\n\nThe classification of financial assets reflects the basis on which those assets are subsequently measured in the statement of financial position and how gains and losses generated by\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nthose assets are reported. The classification of financial assets (including the application of classification options) is assessed at initial recognition applying the guidance below and cannot be modified a/f\\_t erwards, unless if, in extremely rare cases, the business model in which those financial assets are held changes.\n\n## Financial assets held directly\n\nFinancial assets are classified in the three following measurement categories, based on the business model in which those financial assets are held and on the characteristics of their contractual cash flows:\n\n- \u25a0 a financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows from the assets held, and (ii) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding ('SPPI');\n- \u25a0 if both (i) the asset is  held within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (which is the major business model for AXA's investments in debt instruments), and (ii) the contractual terms of cash flows are SPPI, the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FV OCI') and realized gains or losses are recycled through profit or loss upon sale;\n- \u25a0 assets not fitting either of these categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss ('FV P&L').\n\nIn addition to the general classification guidance above, the Group uses the following classification options:\n\n- \u25a0 optional FV OCI designation for investments in equity instruments (other than those held for trading), also referred to as 'FV OCI without recycling'. When applying this option, all subsequent changes in fair value on concerned equity instruments are presented in OCI and never recycled to profit or loss; however, the corresponding cumulative gains or losses are transferred to retained earnings on derecognition. Dividends received on those instruments are recognized in profit or loss. AXA applies this optional designation for most of equity securities held except those backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders, measured at a FV P&L basis;\n- \u25a0 optional FV P&L designation (Fair Value Option for financial assets). AXA applies this option for some financial assets that otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FV OCI, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, for example, for some loans backing insurance contracts measured using the Variable Fee Approach described in paragraph 1.14.7.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Those portfolios are managed, and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.\n\nUnderlying financial instruments held in the 'Core Investment Portfolios' are classified on a line-by-line basis as if they were held directly. Debt instruments held in those funds are managed  within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and, by consequence, are measured at FV OCI to the extent that their contractual cash flows are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nUnderlying financial instruments held in the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios' are held within a business model whose objective is achieved neither by collecting contractual cash flows nor collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and are, therefore, accounted for at FV P&L.\n\n## 1.9.2.2 IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS\n\nThe impairment applies to debt instruments, loans and receivables measured at amortized cost or at FV OCI and reflects Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') on those financial assets.\n\nThe Group measures ECL allowances at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u25a0 12-month ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the 12 months a/f\\_t er the reporting date and recognized for financial instruments for which the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition (it is also assumed that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument has low credit risk at the reporting date); or\n- \u25a0 lifetime ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument and calculated for financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, as well as for financial instruments for which a credit event has occurred since their initial recognition.\n\nECL for receivables that are within the scope of IFRS 9, typically outstanding for a relatively short period of time, are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFinancial instruments for which 12-month ECL are recognized referred to as 'Stage 1' financial instruments. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognized but for which no credit event has occurred are referred to as 'Stage 2' financial instruments. Finally, financial instruments for which a credit event has occurred since their initial recognition are referred to as credit-impaired, or 'Stage 3' financial instruments.\n\nTo perform the impairment stage allocation, at each reporting date, the Group assesses, for each financial instrument within the scope of the ECL calculation:\n\n- \u25a0 whether the financial instrument has low credit risk;\n- \u25a0 whether the credit risk on the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition;\n- \u25a0 whether the credit risk on the financial instrument previously classified in Stage 2 has improved since the previous reporting date; and\n- \u25a0 whether a credit event (default) has occurred.\n\nThe approach used by AXA to perform the impairment stage allocation includes the following components:\n\n- \u25a0 the quantitative assessment designed to detect, for all financial assets within the scope of the ECL calculation, significant increases and decreases in credit risk. This quantitative assessment is based on the AXA's IFRS 9 rating which captures all relevant information, including forwardlooking information, required to identify significant changes in credit risk since initial recognition based on fact and circumstances specific to the financial asset; and\n- \u25a0 the qualitative assessment, based on expert judgment, performed to confirm transfers between 'Stage 1' and 'Stages 2 or 3' for material exposures within the scope derived from the quantitative assessment.\n\nECL is defined at each financial reporting date based on the key inputs which are the probability of the default, the magnitude of the potential credit loss after any potential recovery and the exposure to the risk of default determined as the financial instrument's gross carrying amount plus the accrued interests at the closing date.\n\nThe amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk on the concerned financial instruments. Any increase in credit risk gives rise to an additional ECL allowance. Previously recognized ECL allowances are reversed when the corresponding credit risk improves. ECL allowances and reversals are recognized in profit or loss and, as a counterpart, a/ff ect:\n\n- \u25a0 for the financial instruments measured at amortized cost, their carrying value in the statement of financial position;",

Since substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The liability in balance of the cash received is reported separately in the statement of financial position. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty with a corresponding agreement. Cash flows equal to those of the underlying assets will be remitted to the Group in exchange for specified payments taking into account any increase or decline in the fair value of the assets. This results in substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remaining with the Group. As such, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets.\n\nThe Group is also party to reverse repurchase agreements under which financial assets are purchased from a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to return these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. If substantially all of the risks and rewards of the securities remain with the counterparty over the entire lifetime of the agreement of the transaction, the securities concerned are not recognized as financial assets of the Group. The asset in face of the cash disbursed is recorded under financial investments, except for transactions arising from banking activities, for which it is recorded as a separate asset. Interest income on reverse repurchase agreements is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\n## 1.10  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at purchase date and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the reporting date. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss unless they relate to a qualifying hedge relationship as described below.\n\nIn the statement of financial position, derivatives are presented in separate line items, as an asset or a liability depending upon the fair value position at the reporting date, with no o/ff setting, regardless of whether these derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either: (i) hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable future transaction (cash flow hedge), or (ii) hedging the exposure to changes in fair value\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nof a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), or (iii) hedging net investments in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).\n\nThe Group formally documents, at inception of a designated hedging relationship, its Risk Management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation includes (i) the identification of the hedged item and of the hedging instrument, (ii) the nature of the risk being hedged, (iii) the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in the value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to o/ff set each other, (iv) and how the assessment of whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge e/ff ectiveness requirements will be performed, including its analysis of the sources of hedge ine/ff ectiveness.\n\nThe hedging relationship documentation is updated on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe purposes and conditions of the use of derivatives within the Group are detailed in Note 18.\n\n## 1.10.1 Cash flow hedge\n\nA separate component of equity, referred to as cash flow hedge reserve, is adjusted through other comprehensive income ('OCI') for the lower of the following amounts:\n\n- \u25a0 gain or loss on the hedging instrument cumulated since inception of the hedge; and\n- \u25a0 change in fair value of the hedged item cumulated since inception of the hedge ( i.e . the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows).\n\nIf the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument exceeds the change in fair value of the hedged item (sometimes referred to as an 'over-hedge'), the related ineffectiveness is recognized in profit or loss. If the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is lower than the change in fair value of the hedged item (sometimes referred to as an 'under-hedge'), no ine/ff ectiveness appears.\n\nCumulative gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recycled in the statement of profit or loss when the hedged underlying item impacts the profit or loss for the period (for example when the hedged future transaction is recognized). When a hedging instrument reaches its maturity date or is sold, or when a hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains or losses in shareholders' equity are released in profit or loss when the initially hedged future transaction ultimately impacts the statement of profit or loss. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses are immediately reclassified from shareholders' equity to profit or loss.\n\n## 1.10.2 Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges of equity instruments designated at FV OCI are recorded in OCI, without recycling into profit or loss, together with changes in fair value of the hedged equity instrument.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Therefore, the gain or loss relating to any ine/ff ective portion is directly recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 1.10.3 Net investment hedge\n\nThe accounting of net investments in foreign operations hedge is similar to the accounting of cash flow hedge. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the e/ff ective portion of the hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity; the gain or loss relating to the ine/ff ective portion is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses in shareholders' equity impact the statement of profit or loss only on disposal of the foreign operations.\n\n## 1.10.4 Cost of hedging approach\n\nWhen only a part of a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument (for example, changes in intrinsic value of a purchased option or changes in the spot element of a forward contract), the Group applies a specific accounting mechanism in IFRS 9 referred to as 'cost of hedging approach' and resulting in less volatility in profit or loss. Conversely, the cost of hedging approach is not applied when hedging equity instruments are measured at FV OCI without recycling.\n\nConsistent with the cost of hedging approach, if only changes in intrinsic value of an option are designated as the hedging instrument, the changes in fair value of the time value of the option are deferred in OCI. This cumulated amount is removed from OCI and recognized in profit or loss following the timing that depends on the nature of the hedged item:\n\n- \u25a0 if the hedged item is transaction related ( e.g . a forecast purchase denominated in a foreign currency) - when the hedged transaction a/ff ects profit or loss;\n- \u25a0 if the hedged item is time-period related ( e.g . the fair value of an item for a period of time) - over the period of the hedge.\n\nThe identical approach applies to:\n\n- \u25a0 the changes in forward points of a forward contract when only the change in the spot element of such a contract is designated as the hedging instrument; and\n- \u25a0 the changes in the foreign currency basis spread when separated from a financial instrument and excluded from the designation of that financial instrument as the hedging instrument.\n\n## 1.10.5 Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nMost derivatives used by the Group are purchased with a view to hedge or as an alternative to gain exposure to certain\n\nI\n\nI\n\nasset classes through 'synthetic positions'. However, given IFRS 9 constraints, only qualifying hedges are eligible to hedge accounting provisions described above. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group holds financial instruments that also include embedded derivatives. A derivative embedded in a contract where the host is a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9 is not separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification applying the guidance described in paragraph 1.9.2.1. Conversely, if the host contract is a financial liability within the scope of IFRS 9 and is not  measured at FV P&L, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract to the extent that the impact is deemed material, unless the economic characteristics and risks of both the embedded derivative and the host contract are closely related. In this case, the host contract is accounted for as a financial liability within the scope of IFRS 9, and the separated derivative is accounted for at FV P&L and might be eligible as a hedging instrument.\n\n## 1.11  ASSETS/LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND ASSETS/LIABILITIES INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThese comprise assets, particularly buildings or operations, intended to be sold or discontinued within twelve months. Subsidiaries  held  for  sale  remain  within  the  scope  of consolidation until the date on which the Group loses e/ff ective control. The assets and activities (assets and liabilities) concerned are measured at the lower of net carrying value and fair value net of selling costs. They are presented in separate asset and liability items on the  statement of financial position. The liabilities of subsidiaries (excluding shareholders' equity) held for sale are entered separately on the liability side of the statement of financial position, with no netting against assets.\n\nIn the event of a discontinuation of operations representing either a business line, a main and distinct geographical region or a subsidiary acquired solely with a view to reselling, their a/f\\_t ertax contribution is stated on a separate line of the statement of profit or loss. For comparison purposes, the same applies to the presentation of income statements relating to previous periods that are included in the financial statements. This separate line also includes the post-tax gain/loss recognized on the disposal of the discontinued operation at the date of loss of control.\n\n## 1.12  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits while cash equivalents are short-term, liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to low volatility.",

The judgments that have the most significant e/ff  ects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements relate to the classification of contracts, their level of aggregation and their measurement.\n\nIn particular, the Group makes significant judgments regarding inputs, assumptions concerning the future and other sources of uncertainty at the reporting date, and uses estimation techniques to measure the insurance contracts. These assumptions and estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis, based on changes in facts and circumstances (including market changes), which leads to adjustments in the measurement of contracts.\n\nThe Group uses notably assumptions to project future cash flows and ensures to design them to adequately reflect any uncertainty underlying the cash flows. Non-market assumptions, based on latest best estimate assumptions (historical data and expert judgment), include the following information: loss ratios, best estimate schedule of lapses, policyholder behavior ( e.g . dynamic lapses, election to guaranteed annuity), and management actions ( e.g . discretionary benefits distribution policy).\n\nIn respect of estimation techniques used to measure the nonLife insurance contracts, di/ff erent actuarial projection models are applied, based on (i) the portfolios' main features (in terms of risk drivers, underwriting and claims policies), (ii) quality,\n\nrelevance and consistency over time of available statistical data,\n\n(iii) selection of relevant actuarial assumptions and models, and (iv) ability to economically interpret and justify the projected range of results, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The assessment whether a contract transfers a significant insurance risk considers all substantive rights and obligations (including those arising from law or regulation) and is based on the use of judgment. In substance, insurance contract services provided to a policyholder include the insurance coverage and may also include an investment-return service, corresponding to the generation of an investment return for the policyholder having underwritten an insurance contract without direct participation features, and an investment-related service corresponding to the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder having underwritten an insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\n## 1.14.1.1  INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DIRECT PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nThe  Group  classifies  as  insurance  contract  with  direct participation features ( i.e . direct participating contract) a contract for which (i) the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items, (ii) the Group expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and (iii) the Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items. In addition to the transfer of significant insurance risk to the issuer, a direct participating contract is therefore based on a substantially investment-related service under which an entity promises an investment return on underlying items (the link must be enforceable), as well as on a contractually specified participation. The underlying items determine some of the amounts payable to a policyholder and can comprise any items ( e.g . a reference portfolio of assets, technical items, the net\n\nI\n\nI\n\nassets of the entity, or a specified subset of the net assets of the entity). The nature of underlying items mainly depends on local regulation and products' features. The Group assesses whether the conditions above are met using its expectations at inception of the contract and needs not reassess the conditions a/f\\_t erwards, unless the contract is modified.\n\n## 1.14.1.2  INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITHOUT DIRECT PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nThe Group classifies as insurance contract without direct participation features an insurance contract that is not an insurance contract with direct participation features, namely:\n\n- \u25a0 an insurance contract with indirect participation features ( i.e . indirect participating contract) because the payment to policyholders depends upon the return on underlying items, without meeting the criteria defined for insurance contracts with direct participation features; or\n- \u25a0 an insurance contract without any participation features ( i.e . non-participating contract) as the payment to policyholders does not depend upon the return on underlying items.\n\n## 1.14.1.3  INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITH DISCRETIONARY PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nThe Group classifies as investment contract with discretionary participation features a financial instrument that provides a particular investor with the contractual right to receive both an amount not subject to the discretion of the issuer (usually the account value or the value of the Unit-Linked) and an additional amount subject to the discretion of the issuer, which is expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits. Even though these contracts do not meet the definition of an insurance contract (as they do not include a transfer of significant insurance risk), IFRS 17 applies to those contracts as the Group also issues insurance contracts. Following IFRS 17 guidance, the investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued by AXA have been assessed as meeting the criteria of insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\nFurthermore, as described in paragraph 1.15 of this Note, the Group holds investments contracts with no discretionary participation features for which IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments applies.\n\n## 1.14.2 Separating components from insurance contracts\n\nThe following components are separated from insurance contracts: (i) distinct embedded derivatives, if they meet certain specified criteria, (ii) distinct investment components, and (iii) distinct performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services. These components are accounted for separately by the Group in accordance with the related standards.\n\nA/f\\_t  er having performed this separation, the Group applies IFRS 17 to all remaining components of the host insurance contract. All these remaining components, including embedded derivatives",

Each entity is responsible for defining the level of aggregation of insurance contracts into di/ff erent groups by applying the process herea/f\\_t er:\n\n- \u25a0 first, portfolios of insurance contracts are identified, each of them only comprising contracts that are managed together and subject to similar risks:\n- \u00b7 since the way insurance contracts are managed is based on the nature of service provided to the policyholder ( e.g . Savings, Protection, Health, Motor, Household\u2026), contracts for which the service provided to the policyholder is substantially similar are managed together. In assessing the nature of the service provided, the entity considers di/ff  erent factors such as the granularity at which the internal strategy is designed, the business units organisation or the granularity of financial reporting,\n- \u00b7 contracts are bearing similar risks when the nature of the risk drivers (death, longevity, disability, invalidity, liability, motor, property damage \u2026) at inception of contracts is similar;\n- \u25a0 then, these portfolios are broken down by annual cohort (IFRS 17 as issued by the IASB preventing contracts issued more than one year apart from being included in the same group). However, as an exception, AXA has chosen to use the option allowed by the European Union not to apply this requirement to:\n- \u00b7 groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features  and  groups  of  investment  contracts  with discretionary participation features, having cash flows that a/ff  ect or are a/ff  ected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts, and\n- \u00b7 groups of insurance contracts that are managed across generations of contracts and that meet certain conditions and have been approved by supervisory authorities for the application of the matching adjustment;\n- \u25a0 finally, a further split is performed depending on the level of profitability, with notably a separate group for contracts that are onerous at initial recognition.\n\nA group of insurance contracts should not be reconsidered a/f\\_t er initial recognition.\n\n## 1.14.4 Initial recognition\n\nThe groups of insurance contracts issued are recognized from the earliest of (i) the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts, which is the general case, (ii) the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due, and (iii) for a group of onerous contracts, the date when this group becomes onerous.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFor investment contracts with discretionary participation features, the date of initial recognition is the date when AXA becomes party to the contract.\n\n## 1.14.5The General Measurement Model or 'BBA'\n\nIFRS 17 requires applying by default the General Measurement Model of insurance contracts, called the 'Building Block Approach' ('BBA') as it is based on the following building blocks:\n\n- \u25a0 the Fulfilment Cash Flows ('FCF'), which comprise:\n- \u00b7 the present value of future cash flows (PVFCF) corresponding to a probability-weighted estimates of future cash inflows and outflows (forward looking) with an adjustment to reflect the time value of money ( i.e . discounting) and the financial risks associated with those future cash flows (market consistent), and\n- \u00b7 a risk adjustment ('RA') for non-financial risk;\n- \u25a0 the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM'), which is calculated at inception as the di/ff erence between the premium paid by the policyholder and the expected FCF, and corresponds to the present value of future expected profits.\n\nThe Group has adopted a 'year-to-date' approach, which consists, for the annual reporting period, in changing the treatment of accounting estimates made in its previous interim financial statements ( i.e . as at end June).\n\nThe BBA mainly applies to AXA long term Protection and Health business (notably in Japan), as well as to few General Account savings contracts with no direct participation features (almost exclusively in Belgium and, to a lesser extent, in Spain) and assumed long term reinsurance treaties (including reinsurance of savings contracts with direct participation features such as Prefon in France).\n\n## 1.14.5.1. INSURANCE ACQUISITION CASH FLOWS ('IACF')\n\nThe insurance acquisition cash flows arise from the costs of selling, underwriting and starting a group of insurance contracts. When these IACF are incurred prior to the date of initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts, such IACF are recognized as an asset, which is deducted from the carrying amounts of insurance contracts. The recoverability of assets for IACF is assessed at the end of each reporting period, if facts and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If an impairment loss is identified, the carrying amount of the asset for IACF is adjusted and the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. When the group of insurance contract is recognized, the corresponding asset for IACF is derecognized and included in the measurement of that group.\n\n## 1.14.5.2  ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS\n\nThe FCF notably include all the probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows within the boundary of each contract already recognized. Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which AXA can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums or in which the entity has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with services.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

An Ultimate Forward Rate ('UFR') macro-economically defined as the sum of the average of past real interest rates and central bank's target inflation is also considered. Discount rates between the LLP and the UFR maturities are obtained by extrapolation.\n\nThe yield curves used by AXA for main currencies are summarized in Note 12.1.6.\n\nThe Group has chosen to apply the 'OCI option' (refer to paragraph 1.21.2) to all portfolio of insurance contracts, allowing to recognize the impact of changes in discount rates through Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## 1.14.5.4  RISK ADJUSTMENT FOR NON-FINANCIAL RISK ('RA')\n\nThe  measurement  of  the  risk  adjustment  reflects  the compensation required by AXA for bearing the uncertainty around the amount and timing of the future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk as AXA fulfils insurance contracts. In this respect, the Group considers the 62.5 th -67.5 th percentile range as the adequate level of prudence on underlying insurance liabilities.\n\nThe determination of the risk adjustment follows a valueat-risk type approach, reflecting a retained confidence level with reference to the risk drivers of insurance liabilities. The value-at-risk is the maximum loss within a certain confidence level. The implementation is slightly di/ff erent between Life & Health and Property & Casualty businesses. For Life & Savings, groups of contracts are first shocked, risk factor by risk factor, up to the retained confidence level to assess the change in the present value of future cash flows. Then, diversification benefits between risks implicit to the entity's portfolio are considered by applying correlation factors between risks. For Property & Casualty liabilities for incurred claims, a direct value-at-risk calculation, reflecting the retained confidence level, is applied to the full probability distribution of the related liabilities. Finally, a diversification e/ff ect between AXA entities is considered to reflect the fact that a same risk is unlikely to impact all the Group's entities at the same time.\n\nThe changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk are presented in the insurance service result ( i.e . they are not disaggregated into an insurance service component and an insurance finance component).\n\n## 1.14.5.5  CONTRACTUAL SERVICE MARGIN ('CSM')\n\nFor a group of insurance contracts, the CSM represents the unearned profit attributable to the shareholders. At inception, the CSM is the amount that o/ff sets the FCF, less the derecognition of any IACF (see above), or the value of the AXA's rights in excess of the value of its obligations under the insurance contracts. On the other hand, the CSM cannot be negative. Consequently, if the expected cash outflows exceed the expected cash inflows , the group of contracts is onerous and the loss, which corresponds",

Hence, the CSM is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period for changes in expected future cash flows driven by changes in technical assumptions (death, morbidity, longevity, surrenders, expenses, future premiums\u2026). Interest is also accreted on the CSM at rates locked in at initial recognition of a contract ( i.e . discount rate used at inception to determine the present value of future cash flows).\n\nMoreover, the CSM is progressively recognized and included in insurance revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the coverage period of insurance contracts (refer to paragraph 1.19.1). The portion of the CSM to be released as part of insurance revenue for a reporting period, which reflects the provision of insurance contract services, is based on coverage units. In practice, AXA:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies the total number of coverage units for each group of contracts, which is the quantity of services provided for the insurance contracts belonging to the group over the expected coverage period;\n- \u25a0 allocates the CSM at the end of the reporting period (before having recognized any amounts in the statement of profit or loss to reflect the services provided in the period) equally to each coverage unit provided in the current reporting period and expected to be provided in the future; and\n- \u25a0 recognizes the amount of CSM allocated to the coverage units provided in the current reporting period in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nGiven the variety of insurance contracts, AXA exercises its judgment to define coverage units, considering both the level of coverage defined within the contract ( e.g . a death benefit over a fixed term, the policyholders' account value, or a combination of guarantees) and the expected coverage duration of the contract.\n\nHowever, this release of CSM is not applicable if there are adverse changes in future cash flows greater than the remaining CSM. In this case, the group of contracts becomes onerous and the loss is immediately recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nWhen a group of insurance contracts is onerous, on initial recognition or subsequently, the LRC includes a loss component reflecting the loss recognized in the statement of profit or loss. As long as the group of contracts remains onerous, subsequent changes in the amount of loss component are immediately allocated to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 1.14.5.6  LIABILITY FOR INCURRED CLAIMS ('LIC')\n\nA/f\\_t er initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts, the carrying amount of the group at each reporting date is the sum of two di/ff  erent components: the LRC, that relates to the remaining\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncoverage (see above) and the LIC, which corresponds to the FCF related to past services allocated to the group.\n\nThe LIC reflects the AXA's obligation to investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have already occurred, including events that have occurred but for which claims have not been reported, and other incurred insurance expenses, as well as to pay amounts relating to other insurance contract services already provided or any investment components or other amounts that are not related to the provision of insurance contract services and that are not in the LRC.\n\n## 1.14.6 Measurement with the Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA')\n\nThe Premium Allocation Approach is used for most of the AXA Property & Casualty business and, to a lesser extent, for some short-term Protection and Health businesses.\n\nThis is a simplified model permitted for the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage ('LRC') provided that the measurement of the LRC does not differ materially from the General Measurement Model ('BBA') or the coverage period is one year or less. With the PAA, the LRC corresponds to premiums received at initial recognition less acquisition costs and amounts already recognized on a pro rata basis as insurance revenue at the closing date. However, the BBA remains applicable for the measurement of incurred claims.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows ('IACF') incurred before the recognition of a group of contracts measured with the PAA are recognized as an asset allocated to that group and future groups of insurance contracts that will include contracts arising from expected renewals. In practice, the recognition of a portion relating to the expected renewals is limited to the groups of insurance contracts with up front or extra-commissions paid for acquiring new business.\n\n## 1.14.7 Measurement with the Variable Fee Approach ('VFA')\n\nThe VFA applies to a large part of the AXA Life & Savings businesses (both General Account and Unit-Linked contracts),  as well as for long term Protection & Health businesses which include participating features. This measurement model is mandatory for AXA insurance contracts with direct participation features and investment contracts with discretionary participation features and aims at adjusting the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') to reflect the variable nature of the fee. The adjustment equals to the entity's share of the change in fair value of the underlying items as explained below.\n\nThe VFA is derived from the General Measurement Model (BBA) to the extent that it is also based on a building block approach. As such, the principles described here above in paragraph 1.14.5 are the same, meaning that the liabilities are also made of FCF and a CSM. At initial recognition, there are no di/ff erences between the BBA and the VFA (with the exception related to\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

However, the methodology is di/ff erent for subsequent measurement since the CSM under the VFA absorbs:\n\n- \u25a0 the experience variance of the period generated by underlying items, including the variance on commissions based on these underlying items;\n- \u25a0 the consequences of changes in both technical and financial assumptions;\n- \u25a0 the effect of changes in financial risks not arising from underlying items (such as options and guarantees).\n\nIn order to allow an appropriate pattern of the CSM Release in the statement of profit or loss over the coverage period, consistently with the IFRS 17 definition of the investment-related service, the number of coverage units is determined on the basis of policyholders' mathematical reserves, which are adjusted by considering the expected return of underlying items resulting from Real World ('RW') deterministic assumptions. The main Real World assumptions used by AXA are summarized in Note 12.1.7 .\n\nRW assumptions are based on AXA Group's Chief Economist studies that rely on AXA IM's Research and Investment Strategy team for the short term and on academic literature, international organizations (e.g. IMF, World Bank) studies and dedicated structural models for the long term. Then, RW assumptions are reviewed and validated by the Group Economic Assumptions Committee, in charge of determining economic assumptions to be used for a variety of local and Group processes. This Committee is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer.\n\nThe 'risk mitigation' accounting option is applied to some group of contracts and allows to reduce or remove any accounting mismatch arising from the mitigation of financial risks impacting the CSM by using (i) derivatives, (ii) financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss, held within shareholders' fund or (iii) reinsurance contracts. Under this option, it is allowed (on a prospective basis from the transition date to IFRS 17 as of January 1, 2022) not to adjust the CSM but instead a/ff ect the statement of profit or loss for the changes in the FCF and the entity's share in the fair value return on the underlying items that the hedged items are intended to mitigate. This option is allowed only when AXA has previously documented a riskmanagement objective and strategy for mitigating financial risk. In particular, an economic o/ff set should exist between the insurance contracts and the hedging instruments, and credit risk should not dominate the economic o/ff set. If, and only if, these conditions cease to be subsequently met, the risk mitigation option is stopped (with no restatement of previous adjustments).\n\n## 1.14.8 Derecognition of insurance contracts\n\nAn insurance contract is derecognized from the group of contracts to which it belongs in case of extinguishment, transfer, or a modification of its terms in a such a way that a new contract is recognized in a new group. The derecognition of insurance contracts leads to eliminate their Fulfilment Cash Flows ('FCF')\n\nI\n\nI\n\nand adjust the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') of the group of contracts instead of generating a direct and immediate effect in the statement of profit or loss, unless the group of contracts becomes onerous or empty. Depending on the cause of derecognition, the CSM of the group of contracts is adjusted:\n\n- \u25a0 in case of extinguishment of an insurance contract, by the same amount eliminated from the FCF;\n- \u25a0 in case of a portfolio transfer to a third party, by the di/ff erence between the amount eliminated from the FCF and the premium charged by the third party;\n- \u25a0 in case of a modification of insurance contracts (requiring a derecognition followed by a recognition in a new group of contracts), by the di/ff erence between the amount eliminated from the FCF and any additional premium charged to the policyholder as a result of the modification.  This means that the global adjustments of CSM generated by the modification is split between the initial group of contracts and the new one, depending on the hypothetical premium that the entity would have charged had it entered into a contract with equivalent terms as the new contract at the date of the contract modification.\n\nFinally, if an insurance contract is derecognized because of its transfer to a third party or a modification, the remaining amount previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income ('OCI') is reclassified in the statement of profit or loss when the Building Block Approach applies but maintained in OCI when the Variable Fee Approach applies.\n\n## 1.14.9 Reinsurance contracts\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Group's acceptance of certain insurance risks that other companies have underwritten leading to the recognition of groups of reinsurance contracts issued. Ceded reinsurance refers to the transfer of insurance risks, along with the related premiums, to other reinsurers who will assume the risks as the Group seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk underwritten, leading to the recognition of groups of reinsurance contracts held.\n\nBoth groups of reinsurance contracts issued and groups of reinsurance contracts held are subject to the Building Block Approach ('BBA') or the Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA') described in the previous paragraphs provided that there is a transfer of significant insurance risk; in any case, they are not eligible for the Variable Fee Approach as they are not insurance contracts with direct participation features. As the specificities of the treaties can a/ff ect their classification, each reinsurance contract is subject to a detailed analysis by AXA in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.\n\nWhereas the recognition and measurement of reinsurance contracts issued are similar to insurance contracts issued, the reinsurance contracts held have some specificities which are described herea/f\\_t er.",

        "page_content": "## DATE OF INITIAL RECOGNITION\n\nThe recognition of groups of reinsurance contracts held depends on the type of coverage. When the reinsurance contract held provides proportionate coverage, the date of recognition of the group corresponds to the date when any underlying insurance contract is recognized by AXA. When the reinsurance contract held does not provide proportionate coverage, the group of reinsurance contracts is recognized at the earliest of the beginning of the coverage period of the group of underlying insurance contracts and the date when the entity recognizes an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts.\n\n## BOUNDARY OF CONTRACT\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held, the cash flows are within the boundary of the reinsurance contract if AXA has a substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer or a substantive obligation to pay premiums to the reinsurer. Depending on the relationship between the contract boundary of the direct insurance contracts and that of the reinsurance contracts held, in some cases, the reinsurance treaty might offer protection for underlying insurance contracts that AXA has not issued yet. However, the carrying amount of a reinsurance contract held is nil before any cash flows occur or any service is received.\n\n## MEASUREMENT\n\nSimilarly to underlying insurance contracts, PAA is used for short term reinsurance coverages, while long term coverages are measured with the BBA.\n\nThe measurement of reinsurance contracts held follows a mirroring principle of the underlying insurance contracts leading to estimate the present value of the future cash flows of the reinsurance contract held using assumptions consistent with those used for the underlying insurance contracts. Thus, the reinsurance asset is derived using the same assumptions as those used by AXA for the underlying insurance contracts as these are the ones used to determine the expected reinsurance recoveries. In practice, some reinsurance contracts held by AXA provide cover for underlying contracts that are included in di/ff erent groups.\n\nHowever, using consistent assumptions does not imply the use of the same assumptions as those used for measuring the underlying contracts if those assumptions are not valid for the reinsurance contract held. In practice, the use of the same discount rate might not be appropriate, especially if the reinsurance contract is entered into during the coverage period of the underlying contracts. In addition, the cash flows from the reinsurance contract held include an adjustment for the e/ff ect of any risk of non-performance by the issuer of the reinsurance contract, including the effects of collateral and losses from disputes.\n\nAt inception, the reinsurance coverage, in exchange of a reinsurance premium, is measured as:\n\n- \u25a0 the reinsurer's share of the expected present value of the cash flows generated by the underlying insurance contracts,\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nincluding an adjustment to reflect the fact that the reinsurer might dispute coverage or fail to satisfy its obligations under the contract (risk of non-performance/counterparty risk); and\n\n- \u25a0 typically a 'net cost' (a 'net gain' can however occur in some cases), which is in substance a negative Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') corresponding to the cost paid to the reinsurer, depending on the pricing of the reinsurance contract held and assessed independently of the CSM arising from the underlying insurance contracts.\n\nThe mechanics of the measurement model are the same for the underlying insurance contracts with the difference that the concept of CSM is replaced by the concept of net cost/ net gain. This net loss or net gain is deferred and released in profit or loss throughout the coverage period, in line with the provision of reinsurance services. However, if the net cost of purchasing reinsurance relates to past events, i.e . retrospective reinsurance contracts covering such as adverse development covers for incurred claims, any net cost occurring at inception is immediately recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nSubsequently, at the end of each reporting period, the carrying amount of the net deferred cost or gain for reinsurance contracts held is adjusted to reflect changes in estimates. However, if AXA recognizes losses in the statement of profit or loss on underlying contracts because of adverse changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows, the corresponding changes in cash inflows for reinsurance contracts held are also recognized in profit or loss and therefore do not adjust the net deferred loss or gain of the group of reinsurance contracts held. As a result, there is no net e/ff ect in the profit or loss for the period to the extent that the change in the fulfilment cash flows of the underlying contracts is matched with a change in the fulfilment cash flows on the reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## 1.15  INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITH NO DISCRETIONARY PARTICIPATION FEATURES\n\nLiabilities arising from these contracts are financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9. They mainly include Unit-Linked contracts that do not meet the definition of insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participation features. For these Unit-Linked contracts, the liabilities are measured at current unit value, i.e . on the basis of the fair value of the financial investments backing those contracts at the end of the reporting period together with rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs ('DOC') (refer to paragraph 1.8.2).\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, these contracts are accounted for using 'deposit accounting' (refer to paragraph 1.19.2).\n\nFees received at inception to cover future services are recognized as liabilities and accounted for in the statement of profit or loss based on the same amortization pattern as the one used for DOC.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to o/ff set the temporary di/ff erences taking into account the existence of tax groups and any legal or regulatory requirements on the limits (in terms of amounts or timing) relating to the carry forwards of unused tax credits. The recoverability of deferred tax assets recognized in previous periods is re-assessed at each closing.\n\nIn particular, a deferred tax liability is recognized for any taxable temporary di/ff erence relating to the value of shares in a consolidated company held, unless the Group controls the date when the temporary di/ff erence is reversed and it is probable that the temporary di/ff erence will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. If a Group company decides to sell its stake in another consolidated entity, the di/ff erence between the carrying value and the tax value of these shares for the company that holds them leads to the recognition of deferred tax (including as part of a business combination when the Group as the buyer intends to sell or carry out internal restructuring of the shares following the acquisition). The same approach applies to dividend payments that have been voted or deemed likely, to the extent that a tax on dividends will be due.\n\nDeferred taxes for taxable temporary di/ff erences relating to tax deductible goodwill are recognized to the extent they do not arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. These deferred taxes are only released if the goodwill is impaired or if the corresponding consolidated shares are sold.\n\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the expected tax impact at the end of the reporting period. That would follow the way the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. When income taxes are calculated at a di/ff erent rate if dividends are paid, deferred taxes are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. The income tax consequences of dividends are only accounted when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized. Deferred tax assets related to the Contractual Service Margin (refer to paragraph 1.14.5.5) are measured at usual local tax rate.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.17.2 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefits: they include the benefits payable to AXA Group employees a/f\\_t er they retire (retirement compensation, additional pension benefit, health insurance). In order to meet those obligations, some regulatory frameworks have allowed or enforced the set up of dedicated funds (plan assets).\n\nDefined contribution plans: payments are made by the employer to a third party ( e.g . pension trusts). These payments free the employer of any further commitment, and the obligation to pay acquired benefits to the employees is transferred. The contributions paid by the employer are recorded as an expense in the statement of profit or loss and no liability needs to be recorded once contributions are made.\n\nDefined benefit plans: an actuarial assessment of the commitments based on each plan's internal rules is performed. The present value of the future benefits paid by the employer, known as the Defined Benefit Obligation ('DBO'), is calculated annually on the basis of long-term projections of rate of salary increase, inflation rate, mortality, staff turnover, pension indexation and remaining service lifetime. The amount recorded in the statement of financial position for defined benefit plans is the di/ff  erence between the DBO and the fair value of plan assets a/f\\_t er the cumulative impact of asset ceiling. If the net result is positive, a provision is recorded under the provision for risks and charges heading. If the net result is negative, a prepaid pension asset is recorded in the statement of financial position but not more than its recoverable amount (asset ceiling principle according to IAS 19). Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in shareholders' equity (via Other Comprehensive Income) in full in the period in which they occur. Similarly, the actual return on assets and any change in asset ceiling, excluding the net interest income on assets, is recognized in shareholders' equity. The regular impact in the statement of profit or loss mainly relates to the current service cost (annually accruing employee benefit) and the net interest on the amount recorded in the opening statement of financial position (unwinding of discount applied to the net liability/asset at start of the annual period, taking into account contributions and benefits payments during the period). Past service cost represents the change in the present value of the DBO resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment to a defined benefit plan. It is recognized totally and immediately in the statement of profit or loss when incurred. Gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan also have an impact in the statement of profit or loss when the settlement occurs.\n\nIt should be noted that, all cumulative past actuarial gains and losses on all employee benefit plans were recognized in retained earnings as of January 1, 2004, the date of the AXA Group's transition to IFRS.",

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The same applies to contingent liabilities, except if identified at the time of a business combination (refer to paragraph 1.3.2).\n\nProvisions are measured at management's best estimate, at the end of the reporting period, of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, discounted at the market risk-free rate of return for long term provisions.\n\n## 1.19  REVENUES FROM ALL ACTIVITIES\n\n## 1.19.1 Insurance revenue\n\nThe insurance revenue reflects the insurance contract services provided by AXA over the period, which is derived from the reduction in the liability for remaining coverage ('LRC') during the reporting period, subject to corrections (adjustment of premiums, loss components) and excluding investment components ( i.e . amounts to be paid to a policyholder even if an insured event does not occur).\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nHowever, the way these changes are reflected in the insurance revenue di/ff ers by measurement model.\n\nFor the contracts measured under the Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA'), the insurance revenue corresponds to the amount of expected insurance coverage during the period (or passage of time if not significantly different), excluding any investment components.\n\nFor the contracts measured under the Building Block Approach ('BBA') and the Variable Fee Approach ('VFA'), the insurance revenue corresponds to the release of the LRC, depending on the quantity of provided services, and an allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows (refer to paragraph 1.14.5.5).\n\nIn substance, the amounts related to the provision of insurance contract services include:\n\n- \u25a0 the expected claims, including expenses other than insurance acquisition cash flows, but excluding those not contributing to the fulfilment of insurance contracts ( i.e . non-attributable expenses);\n- \u25a0 the release of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- \u25a0 the allocation of the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') to the period.\n\nThe allocation of insurance acquisition cash flows represents the portion of premiums that corresponds to the recovering of those cash flows to each reporting period in a systematic way based on the passage of time, the same amount being recognized as insurance service expenses. This mechanism enables to add back the part of the premium corresponding to the coverage of insurance acquisition cash flows. This means that insurance acquisition cash flows are not recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the acquisition cash flows occur but when the CSM is released.\n\n## 1.19.2 Fees and loadings from investment contracts with no discretionary participation features\n\nDeposit accounting applies to investment contracts with no discretionary participation features (refer to paragraph 1.15). As a result, amounts collected as premiums are reported as deposits net of any loadings and policy fees. Revenues from these contracts consist of loadings and policy fees relating to underwriting, investment management, administration and surrender of the contracts during the period. Front-end fees collected corresponding to future services are recognized over the estimated life of the contract.\n\n## 1.19.3 Revenues from other activities\n\nRevenues from other activities mainly include:\n\n- \u25a0 commissions and fees received for services relating to Asset Management activities. As the asset management entities of the Group deliver investment management services to their clients, revenue arising from these services may theoretically occur over-time, with a time-based measure of progress, the\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

However, IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers states that revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.

They comprise all revenues and expenses from banking operations, including interest expenses not related to financing, banking fees, capital gains and losses on sales of financial assets, changes in the fair value of assets under the fair value option and related derivatives. On the other hand, they exclude bank operating expenses and change in bad debt provisions, doubtful receivables or loans, which are recorded in 'Bank operating expenses'; and\n- \u25a0 insurance companies revenues from non-insurance activities, notably commissions received on the sales or distribution of financial products.\n\n## 1.20  EXPENSES FROM ALL ACTIVITIES\n\n## 1.20.1 Insurance service expenses\n\nInsurance service expenses arising from groups of contracts issued by AXA are recognized in the statement of profit or loss as they are incurred, excluding amounts allocated to refunds of premiums and payment of policy loans. Symmetrically to insurance revenue, the payments relating to investment components are excluded from insurance service expenses.\n\nAll insurance service expenses correspond to actual cash outflows within the boundary of contracts identified when projecting and calculating the present value of future cash flows (refer to paragraph 1.14.5). These cash flows are:\n\n- \u25a0 those that relate directly to the fulfilment of insurance contract; and\n- \u25a0 those over which AXA has discretion over the amount or timing. In this respect, the change in discretionary cash flows is determined at inception of the contract ( e.g . by identifying the minimum guarantees and defining its profit-sharing policy).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.20.2 Net expenses from reinsurance contracts held\n\nIn the consolidated statement of profit or loss, net expenses from reinsurance contracts held (net income in some cases) are presented separately from the insurance service expenses and included in a single aggregate, corresponding to the net between reinsurance service expenses and amounts recovered from the reinsurers.\n\n## 1.20.3 Expenses from other activities\n\nThe expenses from other activities include the acquisition costs of investment contracts with no discretionary participation features, as well as the expenses that are the twin of revenues from other activities, namely acquisition costs and administrative expenses relating to other non-insurance activities ( i.e . those incurred by insurance entities, assistance services, asset management entities and holding entities), and bank operating expenses.\n\n## 1.21  FINANCIAL RESULT (EXCLUDING FINANCING DEBT EXPENSES)\n\n## 1.21.1 Investment return\n\nThe investment return recognized through profit or loss consists of:\n\n- \u25a0 net investment income from investments other than from banking activities, including the cost of investment activities not included in the fulfilment cash flows ( i.e . those not performed for the benefit of policyholders), net of interest expenses, depreciation expense and impairment related to real estate investments; this item includes interest received calculated using the effective interest method for debt instruments and dividends received on equity instruments;\n- \u25a0 realized gains and losses relating to investments at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income (with recycling), net of releases of impairment following sales;\n- \u25a0 net realized gains and losses and change in fair value of investments at fair value through profit or loss; and\n- \u25a0 change in impairment on investments.\n\nIn respect of banking activities, interest income and expenses are included in the 'Revenues from other activities'.",

        "page_content": "## 1.21.2 Net finance income or expenses from insurance and reinsurance contracts held\n\nNet finance income or expenses from insurance and reinsurance contracts is presented in the AXA consolidated statement of profit or loss with a split between insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThis aggregate comprises the changes in the carrying amount of the groups of contracts that relate to financial risk arising from both (i) the e/ff  ect of the time value of money and changes in the time value of money, (ii) the e/ff ect of financial risk and changes in financial risk ( i.e . e/ff  ect of changes in discount rates, exchange rate, the time value of options and guarantees).\n\nHowever, the option to disaggregate insurance (and reinsurance) financial income or expense between the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the Other Comprehensive Income ('OCI') is applied by AXA in order to limit the volatility in profit or loss (considering that many of the supporting financial assets are measured at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9).\n\nUnder this option, for contracts without direct participation features, the di/ff erence between the valuation of the liabilities at locked-in rates (used for the unwind in the finance income or expenses) and their valuation at current rates is recognized by AXA in OCI. In the same way, when changes in liabilities arise from a contractual link (indexation) between inflation and the payments to policyholders, the changes due to inflation that relate to future services shall also be considered as resulting from a financial risk and therefore are recognized by AXA through OCI with a release over the duration of the payments to the policyholders. The amount included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total insurance (and reinsurance) finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts. This systematic allocation is based on the characteristics of the contracts, depending on whether the changes in assumptions relating to financial risk have a substantial e/ff ect on the amount paid to the policyholder or not:\n\n- \u25a0 when the changes in financial risk assumptions do not have a substantial e/ff ect on amounts paid to the policyholders, the systematic allocation is determined using the discount rates at the date of initial recognition of the groups of contracts measured with the Building Block Approach and at the date of the incurred claims for groups of contracts applying the Premium Allocation Approach;\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- \u25a0 when the changes in financial risk assumptions do have a substantial effect on amounts paid to the policyholder, the systematic allocation is determined by using a rate that allocates the remaining revised expected finance income or expenses over the remaining duration of the group of contracts at a constant rate ( i.e . the e/ff ective yield approach) or a crediting rate based on the amounts credited to the policyholders in the period and expected to be credited in future periods ( i.e . the projected crediting approach).\n\nAXA also applies the OCI option for direct participating contracts. It consists in recognizing in finance income or expenses (with OCI as a balance) an amount that exactly matches the income or expenses included in profit or loss on the underlying items held, resulting in the net of the separately presented items being nil. However, a negative accounting mismatch in OCI structurally occurs as some underlying items, notably investments in real estate properties, are accounted for at amortized cost by AXA, with therefore no recognition of unrealized gains and losses in shareholders' equity while these unrealized gains and losses are included in the value of the contracts with a corresponding opposite e/ff ect in OCI.\n\n## 1.22  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nOther income and expenses notably include other insurance expenses, which correspond to overheads assessed as being not attributable to the fulfilment of insurance contracts (refer to paragraph 1.14.5), but exclude expenses from other activities (refer to paragraph 1.20.3).\n\n## 1.23  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nSubsequent events relate to events that occur between the  end of the reporting period date and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue:\n\n- \u25a0 such events lead to an adjustment of the Consolidated Financial Statements if they provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period;\n- \u25a0 such events result in additional disclosures if indicative of conditions that arose a/f\\_t er the end of the reporting period, and if relevant and material.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Structured entities often have a narrow and well-defined objective or restricted activities.\n\nThe Group does not hold significant interests in unconsolidated insurance/reinsurance structured entities.\n\nFurthermore, given its insurance business, the Group holds direct investments in corporates of various sectors, such as debt instruments, equity securities and loans. These investments are not designed to be done in structured entities and the whole Group's exposure is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds interests in investment funds including real estate companies. Some of these funds are fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method (see\n\nI\n\nI\n\nNote 2.1.). Other funds are not consolidated because they are not controlled or under significant influence. By nature, and notably because of the power of decision usually given to the asset managers (internal or external to AXA), most of these funds are structured entities.\n\nAs investor, AXA's interests in unconsolidated funds are limited to the investments held. These ones are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Depending on the nature of its investment, AXA receives interests or dividends and can realize capital gains or losses in case of sale. These investments are subject to impairment testing as any financial asset.\n\nThe Group's asset manager companies also receive fees for the services they provide when they manage investment funds. Some unconsolidated funds managed by the Group are partially or fully held by external investors.\n\nInformation on these unconsolidated investment funds are provided in di/ff erent sections of this Annual Report:\n\n- \u25a0 Section 1.1 'Key figures': AXA's total assets under management including assets managed on behalf of third parties;\n- \u25a0 Section 2.3 'Activity Report';\n- \u25a0 Section 6.6 'Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements':\n- \u00b7 Note 7 'Investments' with the breakdown of investments and detail on non-consolidated investment funds in Note 7.8 ,\n- \u00b7 Note 20 'Net investment result excluding financing expenses'.",

These sensitivity analyses were calculated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 upw ard/downward shift of 50 basis points in reference rates simulates an instantaneous shock to the initial risk free\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrate conditions. This means changes to (i) the current market values of fixed-interest assets, with possible changes related to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues, (ii) future reinvestment rates for all asset classes, and (iii) discount rates. The change is applied to the reference interest rates, including the volatility adjuster (for EOF) or the liquidity premium (for CSM). Inflation rates, the volatility on interest rates and the Ultimate Forward Rates are not changed;\n\n- \u25a0 upward/downward shift of 50 basis points in corporate spread is an instantaneous change in credit spreads at yearend conditions applicable to all corporate bonds asset classes and associated derivatives;\n- \u25a0 25% higher/lower value of equity markets simulates an instantaneous shock to the initial conditions for listed equities (including equity hedges) and private equity. This means changes to current market values of all these equities excluding hedge funds, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues;\n- \u25a0 10% higher/lower value of real estate simulates an instantaneous shock to the initial conditions for real estate with possible changes related to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues.",

For Property & Casualty CGUs, recoverability of goodwill is assessed using the value in use approach. These approaches as described in Note 1.8.1.\n\nFor AXA Investment Managers, the recoverability of the goodwill follows a market approach with recoverable value derived from market information, such as the price to earnings ratio of peers, and the earnings expected for the year. This methodology represents the fair value of the Company to be compared with the carrying value.\n\n## MAIN ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFor Property & Casualty CGUs, the value in use approach uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering up to three years and discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value. The earnings included in the business plan of each CGU are agreed with the AXA Management and defined locally considering best estimate operating assumptions, including expenses and loss ratios, investment income, economic capital, premium rates and taxes, all compliant with the various standards and the requirements of supervisory authorities, when applicable. The discount rates used for the valuation are derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which includes assumptions for risk-free interest rates, equity risk premiums, insurance activity beta and leverage ratio that are consistent with the view of the management for the specific market(s) in which the CGU operates. For the main CGUs discount rates ranged from 4.2% to 12.3% in 2023, compared to a range of 3.6% to 10.1% in 2022, and growth rates, applied beyond the strategic plan horizon, where applicable, varied from 1.2% to 7.2% in 2023, compared to a range of 0.6% to 7.1% in 2022.\n\nFor Life CGUs, recoverable amounts are calculated with reference to the expected profitability of insurance contracts. The profitability of insurance contracts is determined by discounting future margins, over the best estimate liabilities, calculated in compliance with IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\n(refer to Note 1.14), based on the current expectations over the evolution of the di/ff erent economic and technical parameters. These future margins are discounted using discount rates that are detailed in Note 12.1.6.\n\n## ALL CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGU)\n\nThe results of cash flow projections exceed the carrying amount of each related CGU or group of units.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of goodwill for AXA XL CGU as of December 31, 2023, evidenced a significant margin. The value in use basis reflects management projections of the cash flows, which are based on the business plan of AXA XL, reflecting strong earnings delivery in recent years driven by significant tari/ff  increases and disciplined growth, combined with further reductions in Nat Cat exposure to reduce earnings volatility. Sensitivities were performed with regards to the main assumptions and under the plausible scenarios, the value in use still exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of the Goodwill for AXA Germany P&C and AXA UK & Ireland P&C CGUs as of December 31, 2023 evidenced material margins. Cash flows projections based on the 2024 business plan approved by the AXA Group management, demonstrate that AXA Germany and AXA UK & Ireland will continue to deliver resilient earnings leading to conclude that their goodwill is recoverable.\n\nThe recoverability of the goodwill of Japan Life & Health CGU relies on the existing Contractual Service Margin and New Business Value (NBV) projections using a reasonable new business multiple, derived from market consistent assumptions. The level of profitability of products sold by AXA Japan in 2023 reached a high margin over the premiums received.\n\nFor all CGUs, in a context where the valuation of securities and interest rate levels would remain low for prolonged periods of time, or volatility and other market conditions stagnate or worsen, new business volumes and profitability together with the value of the inforce portfolio are likely be negatively a/ff ected. In addition, the future cash flow expectations from both the inforce and new business and other assumptions underlying management's current business plans could be negatively impacted by other risks to which the Group is exposed.

As substantially all the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, they are not derecognized.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps where financial assets are sold to a counterparty with an agreement in which the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the financial instruments.

described in Note 1.6 to categorize financial assets it holds, based on the characteristics of the market in which financial assets are traded and on the nature of inputs used to determine their fair value.\n\n## LEVEL 1 FAIR VALUES\n\nFinancial assets are categorized in level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy when their fair value is determined directly by reference to an active market (see Note 1.6.1).\n\nIn 2023, improved market conditions with lower volatility and resilient financial markets resulted in the tightening of bonds' bid-ask spread, leading to transfers from Level 2 to Level 1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net transfer from level 2 to level 1 amounted to \u20ac11,146 million. This amount comprised \u20ac13,850 million transferred from level 2 to level 1, and \u20ac2,704 million from level 1 to level 2, of which \u20ac1,736 million for corporate bonds and \u20ac405 million for government bonds.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Their fair value may be either provided by external parties or measured using valuation techniques. The classification of those assets between levels 2 and 3 depends on the proportion of inputs used to determine their fair value: if those inputs are mainly supported by market transactions and other observable market data, the assets are classified in level 2, otherwise, they are classified in level 3.\n\nFinancial assets categorized in levels 2 and 3 represent a variety of circumstances. A financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument, when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity, in case of significant illiquidity or if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions. Characteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the instrument or be indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\nThe identification of level 3 assets among assets not quoted in an active market involves a significant level of judgment. The following are considered as observable inputs: inputs provided by external pricing services, information obtained from specialized data providers, rating agencies, external surveys. The extent to which such data are external to the Group and not assessed by internal valuation teams is one of the main criteria applied in assessing whether data are observable or not. Should those data be significantly adjusted or would they be outdated because of the lack of newly available factors, such inputs would be deemed unobservable. Another area of judgment is the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety. As a result, a di/ff erent cut between observable and unobservable data and variances in the weighting of the significance of each input against the fair value measurement in its entirety could produce a di/ff erent categorization.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAssets such as certain unquoted debt instruments, some instruments issued on private markets such as private equity instruments or private loans, have always been considered as not quoted in active markets as an inherent characteristic of these investments and included as assets not quoted in active markets or for which there is no active market in all periods presented. Valuations are based either on external pricing providers or internal models using techniques commonly used by market participants. Valuation teams make the maximum use of current transaction prices (if any) and observable data, but some of the underlying sectors to which the investments relate may be so particular that significant adjustments are performed or unobservable data are used. Private equity funds of funds are measured on the basis of the latest net asset values of funds provided to the Group.\n\n## TRANSFERS IN AND OUT OF THE LEVEL 3 CATEGORY AND OTHER MOVEMENTS\n\nFrom January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, the amount of level 3 assets increased by \u20ac3.3 billion to \u20ac36.8 billion, representing 9.9% of the total assets at fair value (9.2% in 2022 or \u20ac33.5 billion).\n\nMain movements related to level 3 assets to be noted were the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac+4.9 billion of new investments mainly in alternative assets;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac+1.6 billion of change in fair value related to investments accounted for at fair value, of which \u20ac+1.1 billion for investments at fair value through profit or loss and \u20ac+0.5 billion for investments at fair value through OCI;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac-2.7 billion of asset sales, mainly of non-consolidated investment funds and equity instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac-0.4 billion mainly from foreign exchange fluctuation impact.\n\nA majority of assets classified in level 3 corresponds to private investments, in particular private equity assets.",

Principles described in Note 7.10.1 apply to the financial investments and investments in real estate properties measured at amortized cost.\n\nThe fair values of debt instruments and loans measured at cost are determined with consideration of market inputs to the extent possible. For level 2 debt instruments and loans, the fair value is mainly derived using valuation techniques based upon observable market interest rate curves. For level 3 instruments, the fair value of debt instruments and loans measured at cost is determined by valuation techniques using limited observable market data.\n\nThe fair values of investments in real estate properties generally cannot be determined via reference to quotes of an active market from an exchange market or service provider, and no real estate property is therefore categorized in level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.\n\nHowever, AXA's investments in real estate properties are mostly physically located within liquid markets with identical or comparable asset sales. Given the regulatory environment, real estate properties located in European markets such as France are valued by experts using very similar approaches described in Note 1.9.1 leading to very limited dispersion in prices, with a majority of market inputs themselves homogeneous in terms of sources and values. Hence, the Group, consistently with the policy described in Note 1.6 which notably considers, for assets not quoted in an active market, the weight of observable inputs in the valuation, concluded that the fair value calculations, which are based on valuations performed by qualified property appraisers mainly based on market observable inputs, are considered level 2 fair values.\n\nHowever, the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety involves judgment and a di/ff erent weighting could produce a di/ff erent categorization.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In 2023, the realized capital gains or losses on these equity instruments amounted to \u20ac-429 million, net of tax.\n\n## C URRENCY TRANSLATION RESERVES\n\nThe total impact of foreign exchange rate movements was \u20ac-819 million (of which \u20ac-814 million from Group share and \u20ac-5 million from minority interests) as at December 31, 2023.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe change in Group share translation reserves of \u20ac-814  million was mainly driven by AXA XL (\u20ac-686 million), Japan (\u20ac399 million), China (\u20ac-172 million), Hong Kong (\u20ac-131 million) partly offset by Switzerland (\u20ac+641 million), and the United Kingdom (\u20ac+87 million).\n\n## EMPLOYEE BE NEFITS ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES\n\nThe total net impact of employee benefits actuarial gains and losses amounted to \u20ac+290 million (of which \u20ac+287 million from Group share and \u20ac+3 million from minority interests) as of December 31, 2023. This positive impact was mainly related to the increase in as set ceiling in Switzerland, partly o/ff set by an overall decrease in the discount rate assumptions used.\n\nAdditional information on pension benefits is provided in Note 23.2.",

This positive impact was mainly due to an overall increase in discount rate assumptions used, mitigated by a decrease in a sset ceiling in Switzerland.\n\n## 11.2.3 Estima te of fair value reserve related to financial instruments corresponding to LIC occurred before 2016\n\nAs explained in paragraph 1.2.1.1 of Note 1 on Transition methods , the other comprehensive income ('OCI') was set to zero at transition for liabilities for incurred claims ('LIC') occurred before 2016 related to non-direct participating contracts. Opposite to these liabilities, the Group holds financial assets at fair value through OCI. The estimate of the OCI net of tax on these financial assets was respectively:\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac+937 million as of January 1, 2022, at transition date (\u20ac+1,251 million before tax);\n- \u25a0 \u20ac-400 million as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac-535 million before tax);\n- \u25a0 \u20ac+20 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac+22 million before tax).\n\nThe decrease in OCI since transition has mainly resulted from the increase in interest rates. The allocation of assets (and therefore the related OCI) to LIC occurred before 2016 has also naturally decreased as these LIC are progressively settled over the time.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In respect of insurance revenue, the tables below show its breakdown between the one coming from contracts measured under MRA and the FVA at transition on one hand, and other contracts on the other hand, the latter combining both new contracts and contracts measured under the full retrospective approach at transition, as well as contracts not applying the annual cohort requirement at transition (see Note 1 Other information related to transition).\n\nThe following changes occurred during the year 2023:\n\n|

analysis of movements in the carrying amount of reinsurance contracts broken down by measurement component, namely (i) the estimate of the PVFCF, (ii) the RA, and (iii) the CSM.\n\nHowever, the carrying amount of reinsurance contracts measured under the PAA is also reported to reconcile with the opening and closing balances of financial statements.\n\nThe following changes occurred during the year 2023:\n\n|                                                                                                      | Analysis of changes occurred in the course of 2023, broken down by

This pattern of recognition therefore only reflects the expected coverage units which do not consider the future expected accretion of the CSM arising from risk neutral unwind for contracts measured using the BBA\n\nand expected return of assets for contracts measured using the VFA. Furthermore, it should be noted that the future releases of CSM will also include amounts related to new contracts that are not yet recognized as of December 31, 2023  and December 31, 2022 . For these reasons, the two tables below do not reflect the expected release of CSM that will be reported in the statement of profit or loss in the coming years for these contracts.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The number\n\nof coverage units is determined on the basis of policyholders' mathematical reserves, which are adjusted by considering the expected return of underlying items resulting from RW assumptions.\n\nThe main RW assumptions used as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 by main currencies are disclosed below.\n\n|                                         |                                | December 31, 2023 RW Rates     | December 31, 2023 RW Rates     | December 31, 2023 RW Rates     | December 31, 2023 RW Rates     | December 31, 2023 RW Rates     |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                         |                                | EUR                            | USD                            | JPY                            | CHF                            | HKD                            |\n|                                         | Interest rates                 | Interest rates                 | Interest rates                 | Interest rates                 | Interest rates                 | Interest rates                 |\n|                                         | N+1                            | 2.2%                           | 4.0%                           | 0.7%                           | 1.0%                           | 3.3%                           |\n| 5y Government (par) rate                | N+10                           | 2.3%                           | 3.3%                           | 1.3%                           | 1.3%                           | 3.3%                           |\n|                                         | N+1                            | 2.2%                           | 3.9%                           | 1.0%                           | 1.0%                           | 3.3%                           |\n| 10y Government (par) rate               | N+10                           | 2.5%                           | 3.5%                           | 1.5%                           | 1.6%                           | 3.5%                           |\n| 10y Government (par) rate               | Credit Spreads                 | Credit Spreads                 | Credit Spreads                 | Credit Spreads                 | Credit Spreads                 | Credit Spreads                 |\n| 5y single-A credit spreads  over Govies | N+1                            | 1.4%                           | 1.0%                           | 0.0%                           | 0.9%                           | 1.2%                           |\n| 5y single-A credit spreads  over Govies | N+10                           | 0.9%                           | 0.9%                           | 0.8%                           | 0.9%                           | 0.7%                           |\n| 5y single-A credit spreads  over Govies | Equity return (incl dividends) | Equity return (incl dividends) | Equity return (incl dividends) | Equity return (incl dividends) | Equity return (incl dividends) | Equity return (incl dividends) |\n|                                         | N+1                            | 7.9%                           | 6.7%                           | 8.3%                           | 6.1%                           | 6.2%                           |\n|                                         | N+10                           | 6.3%                           | 6.5%                           | 4.3%                           | 4.5%                           | 6.4%                           |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

All contracts concerned are insurance contracts as defined by IFRS. Claims development is disclosed in accordance with past published accounts ( i.e. in accordance with IFRS 4 until 2022 and in accordance with IFRS 17 starting 2023).\n\nIn this table, the 'Estimate of gross undiscounted ultimate claim costs, including claims expenses' includes outstanding reserves on reported losses, estimated reserves for IBNR claims, allocated loss adjustment expenses and gross payments. For example, the amount of \u20ac31,512 million appearing in accident year 2021 column represents the gross undiscounted ultimate costs at the end of 2021, which is developed in the subsequent years, moving to \u20ac32,257 million at the end of 2023.\n\n'Cumulative gross payments to date' shows, for a given accident year, the cumulative amount of payments at the end of 2023 ( e.g. \u20ac-21,544 million for accident year 2021).\n\n'Estimate of gross liabilities from 2014 to 2023' represents at the end of 2023 the di/ff erence between the gross undiscounted ultimate cost of claims incurred since 2014 and their cumulative gross payments at the end of 2023, ( e.g. \u20ac10,713 million for accident year 2021).\n\nThe claims development table takes into consideration the changes in scope of consolidation occurred throughout the development period since:\n\n- \u25a0 In case of acquisitions, the claims are only developed a/f\\_t er the acquisition date ( e.g. 2018 for AXA XL), disclosing the nondeveloped piece, if any, in the line item 'Estimate of gross liabilities not developed';\n- \u25a0 In case of disposals, the claims development is retrospectively restated without showing any exposure.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe forex exchange rates applied for all the accident years are the closing rates for the period (December 31, 2023).\n\nCompared to the liability for Property & Casualty incurred claims disclosed in  note 12.1.2) the following components are not included in the claims development table:\n\n- \u25a0 'Estimate of gross liabilities not developed' corresponding to the estimate of gross liabilities of incurred claims prior to 2014 and of claims incurred before the acquisition date of acquired entities (e.g. AXA XL claims incurred before 2018)  as well as gross liabilities not developed, notably annuities and construction (\u20ac32,720 million);\n- \u25a0 'Effect of discounting' corresponding to the discounting impact (\u20ac-16,783 million);\n- \u25a0 'RA' corresponding to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk (\u20ac1,584 million).\n\nAs a consequence, the claims development that can be deducted from the 10 years development table  below does not  correspond to the prior year development shown in the Profit or Loss.",

As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value amount and the related contractual amount due at maturity for such liabilities were \u20ac329 million and \u20ac345 million respectively (\u20ac353 million and \u20ac381 million as of December 31, 2022), including the Euro Medium Term Notes.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1.6. The valuation method of liabilities arising from banking activities excluding derivatives (detailed in Note 18.5) are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 banking liabilities issued at fair value - Retail customers (\u20ac329 million as of December 31, 2023): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are considered as level 1 fair values;\n- \u25a0 retail customers deposits (\u20ac3,010 million as of December 31, 2023) and Corporate customers deposits (\u20ac4,297 million as of December 31, 2023) are not traded in active markets and quoted prices are not available. Given the short maturities of main liabilities arising from banking activities (see Note 13.2), the carrying amounts may be considered as reasonable proxies for fair values. Thus, the fair value of amounts displayed above for these instruments are considered to be level 3 fair values;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 interbanking refinancing (\u20ac2,778 million as of December 31, 2023):\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,751 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac2,751 million as of December 31, 2022): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are considered as level 1 fair values,\n- \u00b7 \u20ac27 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac287 million as of December 31, 2022): mainly based on non-observable market data inputs and are considered to be level 3 fair values;\n- \u25a0 refinancing with central banks: \u20ac189 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac2,076 million as of December 31, 2022): values are based on observable market data inputs. As such, the fair values of these liabilities were considered as level 2 instruments.",

        "page_content": "Effective tax rate stood at 17.58% in 2023 versus 20.42% in 2022. The change relates to:\n\n- \u25a0 impact of rate differences on notional tax charges (\u20ac-124 million) corresponding to the difference between the blended tax (expected tax calculated at each entity level with the applicable standard rate) and the tax calculated using the 25.83% French tax rate applicable to the Company. This tax rate is composed of a basic tax rate (25%) and a social contribution (0.83%). The blended standard rate was 22.92% in 2023 and 23.97% in 2022. The decrease of the blended tax rate is mainly due to positive geographical mix;\n\n## 17.2  DEFERRED TAX\n\nIn the table below, the net deferred tax position corresponds to the di/ff erence between Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) and Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) carried on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position.

The accounting for those hedging relationships is explained in Note 1.10.\n\nThe following tables display notional amounts and carrying values of derivative instruments held by the Group, broken down by risk category and by IFRS 9 hedging relationship, showing separately (i) derivative instruments qualifying for IFRS 9 hedge accounting, by type of hedging relationship, and (ii) derivative instruments used in macro hedges under IAS 39 and other derivative instruments not qualifying for hedging accounting under IFRS 9 but generally used as economic hedges. It is to be noted that, as described in Note 1.2.1.1, hedge relationships previously designated under IAS 39 that involved derivative instruments belonging to underlying items of direct participating contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, were discontinued e/ff ective January 1, 2023.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6",

        "page_content": "AXA uses derivatives primarily to hedge various risks stemming from both sides of the balance sheet in the context of its Asset Liability Management (ALM) strategy in insurance companies, as well as holdings and banks. Derivative instruments used in such hedging strategies totaled \u20ac391.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac437.6 billion at the end of 2022) in terms of notional amount and were mainly used to:\n\n- \u25a0 manage interest rate exposures on fixed maturity investments, long-term debt and guaranteed interest rates on insurance contracts;\n- \u25a0 reduce foreign  currency exposures on foreign-currency denominated investments and liabilities;\n- \u25a0 manage liquidity positions (including the ability to pay benefits and claims when due) in connection with Asset Liability Management and local regulatory requirements for insurance and banking operations;\n- \u25a0 limit equity risk;\n- \u25a0 limit credit risk on certain investments in corporate debt instruments.\n\nAXA also uses derivatives as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions', for example, holding cash and equity futures instead of physical equities. Another example is the combination of government bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) as a synthetic position and an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. These schemes do not add any specific risks compared with other investment assets.\n\nThe notional amount of derivatives which is used to express the volume of instruments outstanding and to provide a basis for comparison with other financial instruments most certainly overstates the level of activity and does not directly measure risk as it greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions. It does not represent the amounts that are e/ff ectively exchanged by the parties, and thus is not a measure of the Group's exposure to derivative instruments. For example, the Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its counterparties to the derivative instruments but is not exposed to credit risk on the entire notional amounts. AXA actively manages counterparty risk generated by derivatives through a specific group-wide policy. This policy includes a limit framework and an exposure monitoring process. Limits are specifically set for each authorized counterparty, based on an internal scoring system. This policy also includes daily to weekly collateralization for the majority of the Group's exposure. The total net collateral given communicated for all derivative instruments including those related to derivatives held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' ( Note 1.9.2.1) was \u20ac6.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac0.8 billion at the end of 2022). This net total includes amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position and unrecognized commitments received or given disclosed in Note 26.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAXA is increasing or decreasing its derivative positions in accordance with AXA's governance framework for derivatives. In particular, hedging activities are one of the most important instruments to decrease the risk of the options and guarantees that are embedded in some Life & Health and Property & Casualty products; they also lead to a reduction of the capital requirements for those business activities under Solvency II.\n\nFor further detail on Asset Liability Management governance, please refer to page 270 of Section 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management'.\n\nIn 2023, the use of derivatives within the Group decreased overall by \u20ac-49.3 billion in terms of notional amount (see   also details in Note 18.2.1.):\n\n- \u25a0 the notional amount of interest rates derivatives decreased by \u20ac42.8  billion mainly in France, AXA Life Europe, AXA SA, United Kingdom and Japan;\n- \u25a0 the notional amount of currency derivatives decreased by \u20ac9.5 billion mainly in United Kingdom, France, AXA SA, Hong Kong and Germany, partly o/ff set by Japan and AXA XL;\n- \u25a0 the notional amount of equity derivatives decreased by \u20ac4.4 billion mainly in France, Germany, Switzerland and AXA XL.\n\nIt was partly o/ff set by the following movements:\n\n- \u25a0 the notional amount of credit derivatives increased by \u20ac6.8 billion notably in France, Germany, and AXA XL, partly o/ff  set by Japan and Hong Kong;\n- \u25a0 the notional amount of other derivatives increased by \u20ac0.7  billion notably in France and Belgium, partly o/ff set by AXA Life Europe and Hong Kong.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the notional amount of derivative instruments qualifying for an IFRS 9 hedging relationship (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and net investment hedge) of the Group was \u20ac58.2 billion versus \u20ac104.8 billion at the end of 2022. The net fair value recorded was \u20ac-912 million as of December 31, 2023, versus \u20ac-4,378 million at the end of 2022.\n\n## 18.2.1 Interest rate derivative instruments\n\nThe AXA Group's primary interest rate exposure is related to contracts with guaranteed benefits and the risk that the value of the financial assets purchased with the consideration received from the contract holders is insu/ff icient to fund the guaranteed benefits and expected discretionary participation payable to them. To hedge against potential adverse market conditions, derivative strategies are used to reduce the risk arising from the guarantee liability over time.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments totalled \u20ac200.4  billion (\u20ac243.2  billion at the end of 2022). Their net fair value as of December 31, 2023 amounted to \u20ac-1,834  million (\u20ac-1,822  million at the end of 2022).

Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac45 million as of December 31, 2023 (\u20ac215 million at the end of 2022). AXA mainly uses (i) equity option contracts (67% of total notional amount of equity derivative instruments), (ii) equity futures and forwards (19%), and (iii) equity swaps (11%).\n\nThese instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- \u25a0 hedge the economic exposure to equity risk  mainly in Life & Health in France (notional amount of \u20ac6.3 billion in 2023 compared with \u20ac8.3 billion in 2022), Switzerland (notional amount of \u20ac1.8 billion in 2023 compared with \u20ac2.6 billion in 2022) and Hong Kong (notional amount of \u20ac0.7 billion in 2023 compared with \u20ac0.8 billion in 2022);\n- \u25a0 hedge equity risk as part of the Asset Liability Management strategy associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits on Variable Annuity products, which amounted to \u20ac0.1 billion at the end of 2023 (\u20ac0.1 billion at the end of 2022).\n\n## 18.2.3 Currency derivative instruments\n\nThe Group has entered into different currency derivatives to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Currency derivative instruments represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the notional amount of currency derivative amounted to \u20ac149.1 billion versus \u20ac158.6 billion\n\nI\n\nI\n\nat the end of 2022. Their fair value was \u20ac1,075 million versus \u20ac389 million at the end of 2022. AXA mainly uses (i) currency future and forward contracts (55% of total notional amount of currency derivative instruments), (ii) currency option contracts (26%), and (iii) currency swaps (17%).\n\nOne of the main objectives of currency derivative instruments used by the Company is to limit variations in net foreign currencydenominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates in order to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreigncurrency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to forex movements. The notional amount of derivatives used by the Company to hedge the foreign currency exposure decreased from \u20ac28.7 billion at the end of 2022 to \u20ac27.0 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nCurrency derivative instruments are also used to hedge foreign exchange mismatch between assets and liabilities in insurance subsidiaries of the Group. While most of the operating units' commitments are matched by assets denominated in the same currency, some entities may invest in foreign currency denominated assets to diversify their investments. This is the case mainly in (i) Switzerland using such contracts to hedge exchange rate risk arising from their investments in equities and debt instruments denominated in non-CHF currencies (mainly Euro and US Dollar) with a total notional amount of \u20ac22.3 billion at the end of 2023 versus \u20ac22.2 billion at the end of 2022, (ii) Japan using future and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exchange-rate risk arising from its investments mainly in fixed-maturity debt instruments denominated in non JPY currencies with a total notional amount of \u20ac18.3 billion at the end of 2023 versus \u20ac16.8 billion at the end of 2022 and (iii) Hong Kong using forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge exchange rate risk with a total notional amount of \u20ac23.8 billion at\n\n- the end of 2023 versus \u20ac25.3 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nA description of exchange rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries and the Company is included in Section 5.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report with amounts of exposures to exchange rate risk and corresponding hedges.\n\n## 18.2.4 Credit derivative instruments\n\nThe Group, as part of its investment and credit Risk Management activities, uses strategies that involve credit derivatives, which consist mainly of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These instruments are used as an alternative to corporate bonds portfolios, when coupled with government debt instruments, but also as a protection on single names or specific portfolios.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the notional amount of credit derivatives held by the Group was \u20ac17.3 billion compared to \u20ac10.5 billion at the end of 2022 (including the instruments held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' for \u20ac6.8 billion;  Note 1.9.2.1).",

TRANSLATION RESERVE\n\nThe tables below disclose a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances of the cash flow hedge reserve and foreign currency translation reserve (incorporated within the OCI), notably: (i) hedging gains or losses of the reporting period that were recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve or in the foreign currency translation reserve, (ii) amounts reclassified from those hedge reserves to profit or loss because the hedged item has a/ff ected profit or loss and (ii) amounts immediately reclassified from those hedge reserves to profit or loss relating to hedges for which hedge accounting had previously been used, but for which the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur.\n\nThe reclassifications out from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit and loss flow to the net finance income or expenses from\n\ninsurance and reinsurance contracts when the hedged item is an insurance or reinsurance contract, or to the investment return when the hedged item is an investment, with the exception described in the following paragraph.\n\nAs mentioned above, previously qualifying IAS 39 cash flow hedges where the hedged items are underlying assets of contracts with direct participation features (see Note 1.14.1.1) have been discontinued under IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2023. For these discontinued cash flow hedges, the amounts cumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are progressively recognized in profit or loss as a part of insurance revenue through the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) release mechanism of the corresponding direct participating contracts, as described in Note 1.14.5.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The level of benefits is generally based on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.\n\nIn Switzerland, the benefit plan is a Swiss contribution-based plan classified as a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 because of guarantees, risks related to the mortality and disability coverage.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index or inflation, as opposed to other countries where pensions do not necessarily receive inflationary increases once in payment.\n\nMost of the defined benefit pension plans are funded through long-term employee benefit funds or covered by insurance policies or Mutual funds.\n\nBenefit payments in the United Kingdom and Switzerland are from trustee-administered funds and plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices. The Board of trustees, generally composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the respective plan's regulations is responsible for the governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules in order to meet the existing minimum funding requirement or funding regime objective.\n\nIn France and Belgium, benefit payments are managed by insurance companies or Mutual funds.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the main defined benefit plan was closed to new members on August 31, 2013, and members who were part of defined benefit sections had the option to participate in defined contributions sections.\n\nAXA XL sponsors di/ff erent defined benefits: pension plans mainly in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, as well as deferred cash awards for executive o/ff icers.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

This represents the fair value of assets backing Defined Benefit Obligations covered by both (i) insurance policies written within the Group that provide direct rights to the employees and, (ii) insurance policies with related parties that are\n\noutside the scope of consolidation. Under these circumstances, these assets are not considered as Plan Assets that would be deducted from the pensions' Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO), but represent reimbursement rights accounted for as Separate Assets under IAS 19. Insurance assets or liabilities (within the Group) and pension obligations remain on the balance sheet.\n\nIn Spain, internal insurance policies were issued in the past backing the pensions' DBO. The allocated assets were part of the insurance General Accounts of AXA in Spain and disclosed as 'Other Assets' under IAS 19. In 2023, the entity holding those insurance policies ( AXA Aurora Vida, S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros ) became legally separate from the reporting entity ( AXA Seguros Generales, S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros ). Therefore, the insurance policies were requalified as reimbursement rights and the allocated assets accounted for as Separate Assets under IAS 19.\n\nConsistently with IAS 19 requirements, the roll-forward of the statement of financial position liability from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, shown below only captures the evolution of the liability recorded in the Group's statement of financial position net of plan assets and cumulative impact of asset ceiling but does not comprise Separate Assets. The table below shows the detailed roll-forward of the statement of financial position liability, with Separate Assets added at each year end for an economical perspective.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## 23.2.8 Near-term cash flows (benefits paid and employer contributions)\n\n## FUNDING POLICY AND FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT AFFECT FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Pensions Act 1995 is one of the main pieces of legislation which governs the operation of occupational pension schemes and the Pensions Act 2004 is the legislation which sets out the scope of the scheme funding provisions and under which regulations were made relating to the funding of occupational defined benefit pension schemes. Central to the scheme funding regime are: the Statutory Funding Objective (SFO), which is a requirement that the Scheme has su/ff icient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions ( i.e . the amount required, on an actuarial calculation, to make provision for the scheme's liabilities); and the Statement of Funding Principles (SFP), which is a document prepared by the trustees which sets out its policy for ensuring that the SFO is met.\n\nAs part of the triennial funding valuation process, acting in accordance with the scheme funding legislation and the trust deed and rules of the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, the Trustee determines an appropriate level of employer contributions to be paid to the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, having consulted with the Scheme Actuary and discussed this with AXA UK plc. The resulting schedule of contributions is prepared by the Trustee and the Scheme Actuary sets out what contributions are payable and by when. This is then agreed by AXA UK plc. Where there is a deficit on a technical provision funding basis, the Trustee will also need to agree and put in place a Recovery Plan, which sets out the period over which the SFO will be met. There is no prescribed period for a recovery plan, but the Pension Regulator would generally be concerned about long recovery plans. The Trustee is required to prepare the schedule of contributions following valuations but may revisit (and potentially amend) the schedule of contributions in between actuarial valuations, for example if significant events occur during the period.  Note that the 2023 normal employer contribution to the Scheme was reduced to 6 million as the actual deficit was lower than expected. Indeed, the Scheme finalized the March 31, 2021 triennial funding valuation in February 2022. As part of this actuarial valuation,\n\nthe appropriate level of future contributions to be paid were determined per annum until December 31, 2030. However, contributions from 2022 are subject to adjustments depending on the deficit calculated at each March 31 from 2022.\n\nIn Switzerland and Belgium, AXA entities used to fund the cost of the entitlements expected to be earned on at least a yearly basis where contributions are determined as a percentage of pensionable salaries depending on the age-class of the beneficiaries.\n\nIn Germany, AXA decided to fund the majority of the pension obligations within the German Holding through an external pension fund. This was committed to reduce discount rate volatility effect, simplify and optimize the Asset Liability Management.  An  exceptional  employer  contribution  of 1,270 million was paid to the fund at the end of 2023.\n\nIn Switzerland, the pension plan has become over-funded (under IAS 19) due to financial and economic conditions since the end of 2022. The Plan Assets are restricted to future employee benefits payments and cannot be refunded to AXA. However, the net asset surplus can be recognized up to an asset ceiling measured according to IAS 19 and IFRIC 14. As of December 31, 2022, only a portion of the net asset surplus was recognized due to the asset ceiling e/ff ect measured at that date. By December 31, 2023, the entire net asset surplus could be recognized based on the actuarial valuation at that date.\n\nThe cumulative e/ff ect of asset ceiling is presented in the pension financial position in the paragraph 23.2.4.\n\nIn France, voluntary regular employer annual contributions are made to Separate Assets, with an objective of an acceptable coverage ratio, remaining within a targeted range after consideration of the yearly predetermined service cost.\n\nIn summary, considering Separate Assets, the net economic situation of the funding for defined benefit plans is the following:\n\n|                                                | Pension benefits   | Pension benefits   | Other benefits     | Other benefits     | Total              | Total              |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                              | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 |\n| Statement of financial position  liability (a) | (1,697)            | (3,547)            | (148)              | (144)              | (1,845)            | (3,691)            |\n| Assets other than plan assets (b)              | 1,023              | 1,056              | -                  | -                  | 1,023              | 1,056              |\n| Net economic position                          | (674)              | (2,492)            | (148)              | (144)              | (822)              | (2,636)            |\n\n- (a)  Amounts representing the defined benefit obligation less plan assets, adjusted for assets not recoverable by the asset ceiling impact.\n- (b)  Amounts including separate assets or right to reimbursements and other assets in Spain in 2022 (refer to paragraph 23.2.6.).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The investment strategy is reviewed regularly, following actuarial valuations of the funded benefit plans.\n\nThe investment positions are managed within an Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework defining an optimal strategic allocation with respect to the liabilities structure. The management of the assets notably includes liquidity management, diversification of each asset type so that the failure of any specific investment does not present a material risk to the plans, and implementation of hedging programs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the pension scheme entered into several longevity swap transactions for hedging 95% of the longevity risk inherent within the pensioner and deferred population:\n\n- \u25a0 in 2015, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April 1, 2015;\n- \u25a0 in 2019, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April 1, 2019;\n- \u25a0 in 2021, for covering longevity risk (subject to a level of retention) of the remaining unhedged members.\n\nFurthermore, a hedging strategy has been put in place to protect the scheme funding level from movements in inflation and interest rate. The strategy is reviewed on a regular basis by AXA UK, Trustees and investment advisors.\n\nAdditionally, caps on inflationary increases were in place in the United Kingdom & Ireland to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.\n\n## 23.2.11 Statement of financial position/balance sheet reconciliation\n\n| (in Euro million)                             | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net position (excluding separate assets)  (a) | (1,845)             | (3,691)             |\n| \u25a0 (assets)/liabilities held for sale  (b)     | 43                  | 50                  |\n| Other liabilities                             | (226)               | (273)               |\n| TOTAL  (c)                                    | (2,028)             | (3,914)             |\n\nI\n\nI",

These options were either subscription options involving newly issued AXA ordinary shares or purchase options involving AXA treasury shares. While the precise terms and conditions of each option grant may vary, options were (i) granted at a price not less than the average closing price of the\n\nordinary share on the Paris Stock Exchange during the 20 trading days preceding the date of grant, (ii) valid for a maximum term of ten years, and (iii) vest in instalments of 33.33% per year on each of the third, fourth and fi/f\\_t h anniversaries of the grant date.\n\nFrom 2013, for all beneficiaries, the vesting of the final instalment has been subject to the fulfilment of the market performance conditions regarding the performance of the AXA shares compared to the STOXX Insurance Index ('SXIP').\n\nAll options granted to the members of the Management Committee have been subject to the fulfilment of this marketbased performance condition.\n\nThe following table shows AXA SA stock options status:\n\n|                               | Options (in million)   | Options (in million)   | Weighted exercise price (in Euro)   | Weighted exercise price (in Euro)   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                               | 2023                   | 2022                   | 2023                                | 2022                                |\n| Options AXA                   |                        |                        |                                     |                                     |\n| Outstanding on January 1      | 7.7                    | 10.0                   | 22.15                               | 21.82                               |\n| Granted                       | -

        "page_content": "The fair value of AXA SA stock options was calculated using the Black & Scholes option pricing model. The e/ff ect of expected early exercise was taken into account through the use of an expected life assumption based on historical data. AXA SA share price volatility was estimated on the basis of implied volatility,\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nwhich was checked against an analysis of historical volatility to ensure consistency. The expected AXA SA dividend yield was based on the market consensus. The risk-free interest rate was based on the Euro Swap Rate curve for the appropriate term.\n\nThe option pricing assumptions and fair value at grant date for plans issued for the last time in 2018 are shown below:\n\n|                                                                 | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Assumptions                                                     |        |        |\n| Dividend yield                                                  | 5.79%  | 6.50%  |\n| Volatility                                                      | 20.72% | 25.05% |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                         | 0.72%  | 0.55%  |\n| Expected life  (in years)                                       | 8.58   | 8.50   |\n| Weighted average fair value per option at grant date  (in Euro) | 1.21   | 1.81   |\n\nThe total cost has been amortized over the vesting period and a nil estimated pre-vesting lapse rate was applied over the remaining vesting period. On that basis, the expense recognized in profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was \u20ac0.1 million (\u20ac0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022).\n\n## AXA GROUP SHAREPLAN\n\nAXA o/ff  ers its employees the opportunity to become shareholders through a special employee share o/ff ering. In countries that meet the legal and fiscal requirements, two investment options are available: the Classic plan and the Guarantee Plus plan.\n\nThe Classic plan allows employees to purchase, through a personal investment, AXA shares either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country, with a discount of 20%. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately five years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees receive dividends distributed by AXA during the holding period and, some potential gains at the end subject to the share price evolution compared to the subscription price.\n\nThe Guarantee Plus plan allows employees to purchase AXA shares with a discount through a personal investment and a bank contribution equal to 9 times the personal investment. The shares are purchased through Mutual funds (FCPE). The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately five years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a partner bank, and employees also benefit from the best of those two features: (i) a guaranteed minimum return of 5% per year on their personal investment, (ii) or, if more favourable than the guaranteed minimum return: a multiple of 4 times the protected average increase of the AXA share price over the holding period. The calculation of the protected average increase is based on the reference price which is the average over the twenty trading days ending on the date preceding the Chief Executive O/ff icer's decision setting the definitive terms of the operation.\n\nAt the end of the holding period, the employees can, depending on their country of residence, receive the cash value of their investment, or transfer their investment in dedicated Mutual funds.\n\nIn 2023, both Classic and Guarantee Plus plans were o/ff ered to employees within the same AXA commitment nature as for the Shareplan 2022.\n\nThe subscription price for the Classic plan amounted to \u20ac22.73 per share (discount of 20% to the reference price of \u20ac28.41). The subscription price for the Guarantee Plus plan amounted to \u20ac26.25 per share (discount of 7.60% to the reference price of \u20ac28.41).\n\nA total of 13.8 million new shares were issued, increasing the share capital by \u20ac347.3 million. The 2023 o/ff ering represented a total cost of \u20ac19.1 million (\u20ac7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022).\n\n## OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## AXA Performance & Restricted Shares\n\nPerformance & Restricted Shares can be granted to key employees in France. At the end of a three-year vesting period and subject to performance conditions, beneficiaries will receive a certain number of AXA shares. The performance condition of Restricted Shares plans is solely linked to the Group Sustainability performance. Whereas the performance conditions of Performance Shares plans are based on financial and extra-financial targets, directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. In addition, for some identified beneficiaries, a compulsory two-year holding period can be applicable a/f\\_t er the vesting period.\n\nIn 2023, the valuation was based on a market price of \u20ac27.48 per share at grant date and an estimate of 5% lapse rate per year. The average fair value of Performance & Restricted Shares weighted by plans and including expected lapse was \u20ac19.11 (\u20ac17.31 for 2022 grants).\n\nThe total cost of the Performance & Restricted Shares recorded as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac68.7 million in profit or loss (\u20ac71.7 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The performance period is currently three years. The vesting period is between three and five years. For some identified beneficiaries, a compulsory twoyear holding period can be applicable a/f\\_t er the vesting period.\n\nThe settlement is made in shares rather than in cash (except where the settlement in shares is impossible for legal or other reasons).\n\nThe total cost of the International Performance & Restricted Shares recorded as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac82.3 million in profit or loss (\u20ac85.7 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## AXA Retirement Performance Shares\n\nAs voted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April 28, 2022, AXA's Board of Directors is authorized to grant retirement performance shares to designated senior executives in France. Under this plan, beneficiaries of Performance Shares have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency II ratio calculated during the performance period of three years.\n\nThe total cost of the Performance Shares Retirement recorded as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac18.0 million in profit or loss (\u20ac18.1 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## 23.3.2 Share-based compensation instruments issued by AXA subsidiaries\n\n## AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nAXA Investment Managers granted Performance Shares to certain key employees as part of its deferred remuneration policy that also includes DIP (Deferred Incentive Plan). The Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan is a long-term award plan in which participants are allocated rights to acquire AXA Investment Managers shares upon completion of a specified vesting period depending on applicable local regulations, and subject to fulfilment of certain performance conditions. The performance condition is based on the achievement of Actual AXA Investment Managers Underlying Earnings Group share versus budgeted and/or investment performance conditions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn 2021, following the change in the deferred remuneration fully in DIP, AXA Investment Managers decided to cease issuing the Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan. As a result, the last plan was the one granted in March 2020.\n\nThe total cost of AXA Investment Managers Performance Shares recorded as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac4.3 million in profit or loss (\u20ac5.7 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## 23.4  COMPENSATION OF MANAGEMENT AND OFFICERS\n\nCompensation costs/expenses:\n\n- \u25a0 short-term  benefits:  the  compensation  paid  to  the Management Committee members in 2023 amounted to \u20ac21.9 million including fixed salary, bonuses, directors' fees, benefits in kind and other short-term benefits (\u20ac25.8 million in 2022);\n- \u25a0 share-based compensations: the expense recognized in 2023 in respect of share-based compensations granted to the Management Committee members amounted to \u20ac15.2 million (\u20ac15.5 million in 2022);\n- \u25a0 post-retirement benefits: the estimated cost of providing defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits to the Management Committee members for the current year of service, measured in accordance with IAS 19, amounted to \u20ac2.2 million in 2023 (\u20ac4.0 million in 2022).\n\n## 23.5  SALARIED WORKFORCE\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group employed 94,705 salaried people on a Full-Time Equivalent basis (compared to 90,443 as of December 31, 2022). The increase in salaried employees by 4,262 in 2023 was mainly due to (i) acquisitions and consolidation of several businesses in Colombia, Ireland, Spain and Turkey (+2,310), (ii) recruitments in nearshore and o/ff shore activities notably in France and at AXA XL (+1,107) and (iii) recruitments to support business growth which were partly offset by (iv) restructuring programs in Germany and Spain.",

On December 31, 2023, the Mutuelles AXA collectively owned 15.65% of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares representing 26.02 % of the voting rights.\n\nEach Mutuelle AXA is supervised by a Board of Directors elected by delegates representing policyholders. Certain members of the Company's Management Committee and Board of Directors serve as directors of the Mutuelles AXA.\n\nThe Mutuelles AXA and two of the Company's French insurance subsidiaries engaged in the Property & Casualty insurance business and Life & Savings insurance business, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie respectively (the 'Subsidiaries'), are parties to an agreement pursuant to which they provide a full range of management services to manage the insurance operations and portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA. The agreement includes provisions designed to ensure the legal independence and protection of the respective client portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA and these Subsidiaries. Certain costs and charges (excluding commissions) are allocated between the Subsidiaries and the Mutuelles AXA through an economic interest grouping (groupement d' int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique) or 'GIE'.\n\nThe Property & Casualty insurance business generated in France by insurance brokers was mainly underwritten through co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements between AXA Assurances IARD Mutuelle and AXA France IARD. Aggregate written premiums under these agreements amounted to \u20ac2,483 million in 2023 (of which \u20ac2,408 million was attributed to AXA France IARD).\n\nOn December 20, 2023, AXA France Vie entered into a reinsurance agreement with AXA R\u00e9assurance Vie France, a reinsurance company co-owned by the Mutuelles AXA. The reinsurance agreement covers a total of \u20ac12 billion of Life reserves.\n\n## 25.2  SERVICES RENDERED BETWEEN AXA GROUP COMPANIES\n\nFrom time to time the Company enters into GIEs with certain of its subsidiaries. GIEs are intercompany partnerships, governed by French law, created to perform various common services for their members and to allocate associated costs and expenses among\n\nI\n\nI\n\ntheir members. The allocation of costs and expenses invoiced to GIE members is based on various agreed criteria including particular activity drivers. The GIEs of which the Company was a member during 2023 covered a variety of common services including services performed by the Group's central functions (GIE AXA) for the benefit of AXA Group companies ( e.g. finance, accounting and reporting, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, information systems, Risk Management, cash management). Expenses invoiced by these GIEs to the Company and its subsidiaries are generally invoiced at cost and are included in the consolidated expenses reflected in Note 22 'Expenses by nature ' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses invoiced by the GIE AXA to its members in 2023 and 2022 amounted to respectively \u20ac284 million and \u20ac261 million.\n\nIn addition, from time to time, certain subsidiaries of the Group render services to other AXA Group companies, notably:\n\n- \u25a0 AXA IM in respect of asset management services, as further described in Section 1.3 'Business Overview - Transversal & Central Holdings' of this Annual Report;\n- \u25a0 the Company which, since being granted its reinsurance license from the ACPR, has been the AXA Group's reinsurance captive, exclusively reinsuring the Group's cedants in both Property & Casualty and L ife, as further described in Note 4.2 'Reinsurance activity within AXA SA' of Appendix III 'AXA Parent Company Financial Statements - Notes to the financial statements ' to this Annual Report; and\n- \u25a0 AXA Group Operations in respect of technology, physical security,  Group  procurement  and  strategic  program management services,\n\nand these transactions are generally performed on arm's length terms and conditions.\n\n## 25.3  LOANS/GUARANTEES/CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ETC.\n\nThe Company has given numerous commitments, including financing  commitments,  guarantees  given  to  financial institutions and customers, pledged assets, collateralized commitments and letters of credit. For a description of these commitments and guarantees, see Note 26 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCertain of these guarantees are given by the Company for the benefit of its subsidiaries and affiliates for various business purposes including to promote development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, o/ff -shoring arrangements, internal restructuring, sales or other disposals of assets or businesses, sales or renewals of products or services or similar transactions), to support their credit ratings, and/or to promote e/ff icient use of the Group's capital resources.

This includes the potential liability of AXA UK under customary warranties and indemnities given by AXA UK to Resolution Ltd. in connection with this transaction.\n\n## 26.4.2 Employee and director Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn addition to other employment-related obligations, various AXA subsidiaries are required to indemnify their employees and directors against certain liabilities and costs that they may incur from time to time in performing activities within the scope of their duties. These activities may include, for example, service as a director, officer, agent, general partner, or in a similar capacity for (i) an AXA Group company other than the employee's principal employer or (ii) a company outside the AXA Group where service is at the request of (or for the benefit of) the Group ( e.g. joint ventures, partnerships, or special-purpose investment Companies or funds). The potential amount of compensation relating to commitments covered by these obligations cannot be evaluated with any certainty.\n\n## 26.4.3 Supports provided without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so\n\nThe Group did not provide any material support without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so to structured entities during the period.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 26.5  OTHER ITEMS: RESTRICTION ON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS\n\nCertain AXA subsidiaries and joint ventures, principally insurance companies, are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise.\n\nIn most cases, the amounts available for distribution from AXA's insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures are limited to net income for the year and retained earnings calculated in accordance with the statutory accounting policies used by the subsidiaries to prepare their local financial statements. Further restrictions may be imposed by the local insurance regulators in countries where AXA operates. In some cases, amounts available for distribution are also subject to regulatory capital adequacy tests or the approval of an independent actuary or subject to individual provisions contained in a company's by-laws.\n\nIn accordance with European Union directives, insurance companies with their registered office in a European Union member country are required to maintain minimum solvency ratios which must be supported by eligible elements. AXA's insurance operations in countries outside the European Union are also subject to local capital adequacy and solvency margin regulations.\n\nAXA SA is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations notably stemming from its Non-Euro participations. The aim of the hedging programs of the Company is to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreign-currency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to foreign exchange movements.",

If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish a reserve and record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. However, it is o/f\\_t en di/ff icult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope.\n\n## 28.1  MATTERS CONCERNING AXA SA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\n\nAXA and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions and proceedings of a character normally incidental to their business including claims litigation arising in connection with the Group's insurance business and litigation arising from the Group's Asset Management business.\n\nIn addition, several AXA subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits (both class action and individual), investigations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where they do business, including the United States.\n\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against insurers in the United States and elsewhere involving the scope and interpretation of policies, insurers' sales practices, alleged misconduct or misrepresentation, alleged failure to properly supervise agents, compensation of intermediaries, product features, fees or performance, alleged bad-faith denials of coverage as well as numerous other matters. Some of these actions have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers (including material amounts of punitive damages) or in substantial settlements. In certain jurisdictions, juries have broad discretion in awarding punitive damages. AXA's subsidiaries are involved in these types of litigations as well as regulatory inquiries, investigations or actions with respect to these and a wide variety of other matters related to the ownership or management of real estate, asset or investment activities, corporate transactions, employee benefit disputes, alleged discrimination in employment practices, as well as other matters.\n\nA number of AXA subsidiaries are involved in ongoing litigations relating to COVID-19 exposure under business interruption policies and non-damage business interruption extensions to business interruption policies.\n\nSome of the litigations described in this section have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants, and certain of the claimants in these actions seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages.\n\n## 28.1.1 AXA XL Division\n\n## US OPIOID AND PFAS LITIGATION\n\nLawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against various manufacturers, distributors and retailers of opioid medications and against manufacturers which utilised perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), some of whom are insured by entities in the AXA XL Division and several of whom have entered into multi-billion dollar settlements. The AXA XL Division is party to coverage actions brought by manufacturers (including Purdue Pharma), distributors and retailers against insurers and others are anticipated. Most of these are in the early stages and it is expected that the coverage litigation (including appeals) and possible arbitrations will take several years to reach final resolution.\n\n## AVIATION LITIGATION FOLLOWING THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine, lawsuits have been filed against the AXA XL Division in the UK, Ireland and the United States relating to alleged aircra/f\\_t  losses in Russia. The AXA XL Division provides coverage to aircra/f\\_t  lessors for their aircra/f\\_t , engines and spares under various types of aviation policies (including lessor war and lessor all risk) as well as other insureds under separate policies (for example, aircra/f\\_t  operators under operator war and operator all risk). The lawsuits are at an early stage, and we do not expect substantive rulings until later in 2024.\n\n## 28.2  OTHER LITIGATION\n\nIn addition to the various matters noted above, AXA and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal actions and proceedings arising out of transactions involving the acquisition or sale of businesses or assets, mergers or other business combination transactions, the establishment or dissolution of joint ventures or other partnerships, public exchange or tender offers, buy-outs of minority interests or similar types of transactions ('M&A Transactions'). In connection with M&A Transactions, AXA and its subsidiaries from time to time:\n\n- \u25a0 are involved in legal actions or other claims brought by purchasers, joint venture partners, shareholders or other transaction parties asserting claims for damages on various theories (including misrepresentation, failure to disclose material  information,  failure  to  perform  contractual duties, breach of fiduciary duties), seeking contractual indemnification, or otherwise seeking to impose liability on AXA and/or its subsidiaries; and/or\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

These indemnities generally constitute unsecured obligations of the indemnifying party and, consequently, their value may be substantially impaired or rendered worthless in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the indemnifying party.\n\nAXA and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in tax assessment negotiations and/or active litigation with tax authorities over contested assessments or other matters in a number of jurisdictions including in France. These actions or assessments arise in a variety of circumstances including matters in connection with M&A, restructuring or financing transactions as well as in the ordinary course of business.\n\nOver the past several years a number of jurisdictions, including France and Belgium, have enacted legislation that permits corporate entities to be charged with criminal offences. The standard for attributing criminal conduct by corporate o/ff icers and employees to corporate entities is not clearly defined in many of these jurisdictions and government prosecutors and judges have broad discretion in this area. In recent years, complaints against or indictments of corporate entities for alleged criminal o/ff ences have become increasingly common and certain AXA Group companies have been the subject of penal complaints and/or indictments from time to time including in Belgium and France . While a criminal complaint against or indictment of a corporate entity may not pose material financial risk, it has broad potential implications for a regulated financial institution like AXA both from a reputation point of view and from a regulatory perspective because a criminal conviction can have potentially far reaching negative implications for AXA Group companies engaged in regulated businesses around the world (including for their ability to obtain or maintain licenses to engage in certain types of regulated business activities such as asset management, insurance and banking).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nBeyond litigation risks of the type described above, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they do business. In this context, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject, from time to time, to examinations, investigations, enforcement proceedings and other actions by regulatory and law enforcement authorities (involving civil and/or penal matters) as well as to proposed changes in law and/or regulation that may significantly impact their business and results of operations. For additional information on these matters as well as other risks and contingent liabilities affecting the Group and its business, please see Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' and Section 7.3 'General Information' and Note 26 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' in Part 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nAlthough the outcome of any lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty, particularly in the early stages of an action, Management believes that the ultimate resolutions of the matters described above are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group, taken as a whole. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, to the Company's knowledge, there were no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings, either pending or threatened, that may have, or have had a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the Company or the Group over the past 12 months. However, due to the nature of such lawsuits and investigations and the frequency of large damage awards and regulatory sanctions in certain jurisdictions (particularly the United States) that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs or the underlying regulatory violations, Management cannot make an estimate of loss, if any, or predict whether these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Group's consolidated results of operations in any particular period.",

IFRS 17 is retrospectively applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\nNote 1.2.1 of the Group's consolidated financial statements presents information on the impact resulting from the first time application of IFRS 17 and the main accounting principles choices applied at the transition date. According to this note, the adoption of this new accounting standard led to a global impact of M\u20ac -19 484 on equity as of January 1, 2022 and the recognition of an initial contractual service margin of M\u20ac 34 301 before tax.\n\nAs indicated in note 1.2.1 of the consolidated financial statements, the measurement of insurance technical provisions according to IFRS 17 is based on new accounting and actuarial estimate involving heightened judgment by management regarding the choice of accounting methods at the transition and the determination of key assumptions. This includes in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 The transition method applied for each group of insurance contracts;\n- \u25a0 The methods and assumptions used to determine the initial contractual service margin (CSM), specifically for groups of insurance contracts assessed at transition on the basis of the fair value approach or the modified retrospective approach, leading management to estimate the CSM by using past information from the European Embedded Value ('EEV') or Solvency II reporting;\n- \u25a0 The application of the fair value approach for determining liabilities for incurred claims before 2016 for non-participating contracts and with the option to set the Other Comprehensive Income to zero.\n\nGiven the importance of the changes resulting from the application of IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', the choices of accounting policy and the significant degree of management judgment in determining certain key assumptions, we considered the assessment of the impact related to the first time application of this new standard to be a key audit matter.\n\nI\n\nIn order to cover the risk relating to the assessment of the impact related to the first time application of IFRS 17 to the opening balances and comparatives of the Group's consolidated financial statements, our audit approach, involving our actuarial specialists, is as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 We assessed the appropriateness of the processes defined by management to determine the impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 on the consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2022, as well as on the comparative financial statements as of December 31, 2022.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the appropriateness of the methods and judgments made by management and their compliance with IFRS 17 at the transition.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the appropriateness of the key assumptions applied to determine the contractual service margin at transition. With respect to the application of the fair value approach, we have examined the reasonableness of the key assumptions and where relevant, compared them against observable market transactions.\n- \u25a0 We have tested, on a sample basis and based on our risk assessment, the calculation models used to estimate future cash flows and the CSM;\n- \u25a0 We have implemented procedures to test on a sample basis the reliability of the data used as the basis for making estimates;\n- \u25a0 We examined the information underlying the main assumptions made by management and the sensitivity of the models to these assumptions;\n- \u25a0 We assessed the appropriateness of the information in the consolidated  financial  statements  notes  relating  to  the IFRS 17 standard transition with regards to the IAS 8 requirements.\n\nI",

In particular, we have focused on:\n- -controls related to the validation of cash flows projection model, including governance regarding model changes;\n- -the documentation and controls related to judgments and key assumptions made by management;\n- \u25a0 We applied procedures to test on a sample basis the reliability of the underlying data used in estimates;\n- \u25a0 We tested on a sample basis and based on our risk assessment, the calculation models used to estimate future cash flows, nonfinancial risk adjustment, and the CSM, as well as any significant change to the calculation models;\n- \u25a0 We examined on a sample basis the appropriateness of the coverage units and of the main deterministic Real World ('RW') assumptions used for the CSM recognition into the income statement;\n- \u25a0 We performed analytical procedures to identify and analyze any material unusual and/or unexpected variation.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

For some insurance contracts, these estimates require a high degree of judgment, and the assumptions selected may have a significant impact on the ultimate claims cost at the end of the reporting period as the inherent uncertainty is higher. This is especially the case for the long-tail Property & Casualty line of business such as general and professional liability, worker's compensation, and other specialty lines.\n- -Current financial assumptions, particularly the determination of the discount rate curve.\n- \u25a0 The RA determination is based on the assumptions concerning the confidence level established by the Group regarding the risk factors of insurance liabilities, and on a value-at-risk approach, which is the maximum loss within the defined confidence level.\n\nDue to these inherent uncertainties to calculate the estimates, we deemed the measurement of liabilities for incurred claims in the Property & Casualty line of business notably for long-tail claims to be a key audit matter.\n\nI\n\nIn order to cover the risk relating to liabilities for incurred claims in the Property & Casualty line of business notably for long-tail claims, our audit approach, involving our actuarial specialists, is as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology applied to estimate the cash flows and RA related to these contracts with the current accounting standards;\n- \u25a0 We assessed the design and tested the operating e/ff ectiveness of the controls we deemed key to our audit and relating to:\n- -the management of claims and, in particular, the measurement of reserves on a case-by-case basis;\n- -the calculation of the ultimate cost (assumptions, judgments, data, methodologies, compliance with the applicable accounting standards), including second opinions supplied by the Risk Management teams with respect to technical reserves;\n- -the IT systems used to process the technical data and integration into the accounting system.\n- -the documentation and controls related to the key judgments and assumptions made by management.\n- \u25a0 We tested on a sample basis the reliability of the underlying data used in estimates;\n- \u25a0 We applied analytical procedures (including monitoring the change in loss ratios) to analyze the significant changes that took place over the reporting period;\n- \u25a0 We evaluated, notably on lines of business where the estimation of claims reserves has a higher risk of uncertainty and judgment, the outcome of the accounting estimates made the previous years in order to assess the reliability of the process used by Management to calculate these estimates;\n- \u25a0 Our work also consisted in assessing the relevance of the statistical methods and actuarial inputs applied, as well as of the assumptions used with respect to the applicable regulations, market practices, ongoing litigations and the economic and financial context of the AXA Group;\n- \u25a0 We performed an independent evaluation of the reserves for some insurance risk categories.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs of the activities into which that business was incorporated.\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill, as stated in Note 1.8.1 to the consolidated financial statements, is performed at least once a year to ensure that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount and that there is no impairment risk.

This is especially the case for the AXA XL CGU.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to recoverability of goodwill, notably for AXA XL CGU, was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards and its implementation;\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the design and tested the operating e/ff ectiveness of the controls related to goodwill impairment test process we deemed key to our audit;\n- \u25a0 We also performed procedures regarding the main assumptions used by Management to test:\n- \u25a0 The consistency of the projected future cash flows with Management's most recent estimates, as established during the business plan;\n- \u25a0 the reasonableness of the assumptions made with respect to projected future cash flows in terms of the economic and financial context of the CGU and, the reliability of the process by which the estimates were calculated by assessing the reasons for di/ff  erences between projected and actual performances;\n- \u25a0 the reasonableness of the discount rate and long term growth rate and their consistency with the projected cash flows to which they apply;\n- \u25a0 We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the main assumptions to ascertain that selected adverse changes to main assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the Board of Directors' management report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements, it being specified that it is not our responsibility to conclude on the fair presentation and consistency with the financial statements of the solvency related information extracted from the report required by Article L. 356-23 of the French Insurance Code ( Code des assurances ).\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is included in the information relating to the Group given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of said Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under responsibility of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. Regarding consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging thereof complies with the format defined in the above-mentioned regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are fre e from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ff airs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25a0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff ectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u25a0 Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\nI\n\nI",

'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, to the best of the Company's knowledge based on the information available to it, the Company had 14,457 total registered holders of its ordinary shares ( i.e. , shareholders holding in nominative form).\n\n## TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED IN 2023 BY AXA INVOLVING ITS OWN SHARES\n\nIn connection with the share repurchase programs approved by AXA's shareholders during their Shareholders' Meetings held on April 28, 2022, (resolution 20) and April 27, 2023, (resolution 12) and pursuant to article L.22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), (i) 64,141,242 AXA shares (1) were repurchased (for the purposes of (a) hedging free grants of shares to employees of the Group or (b) cancelling them) for an average weighted gross unit price per share of \u20ac28.18, and (ii) no AXA shares were sold between January 1 and December 31, 2023.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the total number of AXA treasury shares, all allocated for hedging or cancellation purposes, was 4 3,984,687 (or 1.94% of AXA's share capital at that date). The booking value of these 43,984,687 treasury shares on December 31, 2023 was \u20ac1,154,586,940.67. These shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of \u20ac1,807,808,608.71 (with a par value of \u20ac2.29 per share).\n\nFurthermore, for information purposes, it should be noted that on December 31, 2023, the total number of treasury shares held by Company subsidiaries was 7,148 (or 0.00% of AXA's share capital at that date). The booking value of these 7,148 treasury shares on December 31, 2023 was \u20ac129,182.\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS\n\n## Shareplan\n\nSince 1993, the AXA Group has promoted employee shareholding by offering each year to its employees an opportunity to become shareholders through a share capital increase reserved exclusively to them ('Shareplan').\n\nBy virtue of the authorization granted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April 27, 2023, the Board of Directors increased the Company's share capital through the issue of shares reserved to the Group employees under the Shareplan 2023 program. The shareholders waived their preferential subscription rights so that this o/ff ering could be made exclusively to Group employees ('Shareplan 2023').\n\nIn countries that met the legal, regulatory and tax requirements to participate in Shareplan, two investment options were o/ff ered to the Group employees in 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 the classic o/ff er, proposed in 40 countries;\n- \u25a0 the guarantee plus o/ff er, proposed in 35 countries.\n\nThe classic offer allowed employees to subscribe through a personal investment to AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on their country) with a 20% discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5 years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law). Employees receive dividends distributed by AXA during the holding period and potential final gains, subject to the share price evolution, compared to the subscription price.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## SHARES, SHARE CAPITAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n7.2 SHARE CAPITAL\n\nThe guarantee plus o/ff er in 2023 allowed employees to subscribe, through a personal investment and a bank contribution equal to 9 times their personal investment, in AXA shares through Mutual funds (FCPE), with a 7.60% discount. These shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5 years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a bank, and employees also benefit from either (i) a guaranteed minimum return of 5% per year on their personal investment, or (ii) if more favourable than the guaranteed minimum return, a multiple of 4 times the protected average increase of the AXA share price over the holding period. The calculation of the protected average increase is based on the reference price which is the average of the AXA share price over the twenty trading days ending on the date preceding the Chief Executive O/ff icer's decision setting the definitive terms of the operation.\n\nAt the end of the holding period, the employees can, depending on their residence country, receive the cash value of their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\ninvestment, or transfer their investment in dedicated Mutual funds.\n\nMutual funds (FCPE) have been created since 2005 to allow beneficiaries, in most cases, to directly exercise their voting rights during the Company's Shareholders' Meetings.\n\nThe Shareplan 2023 program was carried out through a capital increase that took place in November 2023. More than 23,000 employees took part in the Shareplan 2023 program, representing approximately 21% of eligible employees:\n\n- \u25a0 the total amount invested was approximately \u20ac348 million;\n- \u25a0 a total of approximately 14 million new shares were issued, each with a par value of \u20ac2.29.

AXA SA, the ultimate parent holding company of the AXA Group, is also subject to extensive regulation as a reinsurer and as a result of its listing on Euronext Paris and its direct and indirect shareholding in numerous regulated insurance and asset management subsidiaries. Given that the AXA Group is headquartered in Paris, France, this supervision is based to a significant extent on European Union legislation and on the French legal and regulatory framework. AXA's principal regulators and supervisory authorities in France are the AMF, which is the financial markets regulator, and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), which is the banking, insurance and reinsurance regulator.\n\nAs a global company operating in numerous jurisdictions, the AXA Group is subject to various laws and regulations. This section does not purport to describe all of the regulations to which AXA Group is subject or to provide all of the information in connection with the AXA Group's supervision in every jurisdiction in which the AXA Group is present.\n\nThis section presents what the AXA Group considers to be the most significant regulations and supervision mechanisms to which the AXA Group is subject as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF.\n\nA/f\\_t  er receiving its reinsurance license from the ACPR in May 2022 and merging with AXA Global Re on June 30, 2022, AXA SA\n\nI\n\nI\n\n92908 Paris La D\u00e9fense, France) until the filing of AXA's next Universal Registration Document with the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (the 'AMF'): (i) the Bylaws of the Company, (ii) the reports or other documents prepared by any expert at the Company's request which are (in whole or in part) included or referred to in this Universal Registration Document, and (iii) AXA SA's financial statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the three financial years preceding the publication of this Universal Registration Document. These documents are also available on AXA's website and, more specifically, at the following links for the Bylaws of the Company (https://www.axa.com/en/ about-us/governance-overview) and the documents referred to in (ii) and (iii) (https://www.axa.com/en/investor/annual-andinterim-reports).\n\nbecame the Group's internal reinsurer. As a licensed reinsurance company, AXA SA is subject to the applicable regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities. The Group has entered into reinsurance treaties with certain of its European Property & Casualty carriers, and enters into reinsurance arrangements with respect to its Life portfolios, in addition to carrying out additional internal reinsurance and interacting with external reinsurance market parties.\n\n## INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE OPERATIONS\n\nWhile the extent and nature of regulation varies from country to country, most jurisdictions in which AXA's insurance and reinsurance entities operate have laws and regulations governing distribution practices, standards of solvency, levels of capital and reserves, permitted types and concentrations of investments, and business conduct to be maintained by insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as agent licensing, approval of policy forms and, for certain lines of insurance, approval or filing of rates. In certain jurisdictions, regulations limit sales commissions, fees and certain other marketing expenses that may be incurred by the insurer and impose product suitability and disclosure requirements. In general, insurers and reinsurers are required to file detailed annual, and in some cases quarterly, financial statements with their supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such agencies may conduct regular or unexpected examinations of the insurers' and reinsurers' operations and accounts and request",

        "page_content": "## SHARES, SHARE CAPITAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n7.3 GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nadditional information from the insurer and reinsurer. Certain jurisdictions also require registration and periodic reporting by holding companies that control or have a qualifying holding in a licensed insurer or reinsurer. This holding company legislation typically requires periodic disclosure, reporting concerning the corporation that controls the licensed insurer or reinsurer and other affiliated companies, including prior approval (or notice) of transactions between the insurer or reinsurer and other affiliates such as intra-group transfers of assets and payment of dividends by the controlled insurer or reinsurer. In addition, such legislation generally provides that any direct or indirect acquisition of a qualifying holding of our insurance or reinsurance entities domiciled in a given jurisdiction will be subject to the prior approval of the insurance and reinsurance regulatory authorities in such jurisdiction; the definition of a 'qualifying holding' for such purposes generally includes any direct or indirect acquisition of shares or other instruments representing more than a 9.9% voting interest, and would include the acquisition of shares of AXA SA as an insurance holding company. In general, these regulatory schemes are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders. For additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Group and its insurance and reinsurance entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions where they do business, which are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to protect policyholders. While the specific regulatory capital requirements (including the definition of admitted assets and methods of calculation) vary between jurisdictions, an insurer's or reinsurer's required regulatory capital can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, business mix, product design, sales volume, invested assets, liabilities, reserves and movements in the capital markets, including interest rates and financial markets. Regulatory capital requirements may increase, possibly significantly, during periods of declining financial markets and/or lower interest rates.\n\n## Solvency II\n\nThe European Union has implemented a regulatory regime for European insurers which became effective on January 1, 2016, following the adoption of Directive 2009/138/EC dated\n\nNovember 25, 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance, as amended (the 'Solvency II Directive') and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together with the Solvency II Directive, 'Solvency II'). Solvency II was implemented into French law beginning in 2015. In June 2019, amendments to the delegated regulations enacted under the Solvency II Directive were issued in connection with the 2018 interim review of Solvency II.\n\nSolvency II is designed to implement solvency requirements that reflect the risks that insurance and reinsurance companies face and to build a supervisory system that is consistent across all EU member states. Solvency II is based on three pillars, applicable both at the individual insurer or reinsurer and group levels: (1) Pillar 1 consists of the quantitative requirements around own funds, valuation rules for assets and liabilities and solvency capital requirements; (2) Pillar 2 sets out qualitative requirements for the governance and Risk Management of insurers, as well as for the effective supervision of insurers, including the requirement for insurers to submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ('ORSA'); and (3) Pillar 3 sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure regime, including the requirement to prepare a Regular Supervisory Report ('RSR'), to be submitted to the competent national supervisory authority on a regular basis as determined by the regulation, and a Solvency and Financial Condition Report ('SFCR'), to be made publicly available on an annual basis. Solvency II covers, among other matters, the valuation of assets and liabilities, the treatment of insurance and reinsurance groups, the definition of capital and the overall level of required capital. A key aspect of Solvency II is that assessment of the Group's risks and capital requirements is aligned closely with economic capital methodologies and allows the use of either a standard formula or an insurer's or reinsurer's own internal model (to permit a better understanding of the actual risks and Risk Management of the insurer or reinsurer) to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'), subject in the latter case to the approval of the insurer's lead supervisor.\n\nSolvency II provides for two separate levels of solvency capital requirements: (i) the Minimum Capital Requirement ('MCR'), which is the amount of own funds below which policyholders and beneficiaries are exposed to an unacceptable level of risk, should the insurance or reinsurance companies be allowed to continue their operations, and (ii) the SCR, which corresponds to a level of own funds that enables insurance or reinsurance companies to absorb significant losses and gives reasonable assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made when they fall due.\n\nThe ACPR has approved the use by AXA of its internal model (the 'Internal Model') to calculate its SCR under Solvency II. The Solvency II ratio of the Group as of December 31, 2023, published on February 22, 2024, was estimated at 227% (1) , compared to\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

The Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its SCR at all times during 2023.\n\nAXA continues to regularly review the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model, and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any significant change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR.\n\nFor more information on the Internal Model, please refer to Section 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management - Internal Model' of this Annual Report. For further information on AXA's SCR, Internal Model and other Solvency II disclosures, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December 31, 2022, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com). AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December 31, 2023 is expected to be published by the end of May 2024 on the same website.\n\n## Solvency II review\n\nThe Solvency II framework is currently under review by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Following the opinion submitted by EIOPA to the European Commission on December 17, 2020 as part of the review of the Solvency II framework (the 'Solvency II Opinion'), the European Commission published on September 22, 2021 its proposed directive amending the Solvency II Directive and explained its overall intentions on the most important aspects of the forthcoming level 2 amendments (in particular with respect to risk margin). On June 17, 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on its position and published a compromise text, with proposed amendments to the Solvency II framework including, among others, (i) the extrapolation method and changes to the volatility adjustment, including the introduction of principles for the modelling of the dynamic volatility adjustment; (ii) new reporting requirements such as (a) the assessment of the impact of long-term climate change scenarios on our business in the ORSA, (b) structural changes to the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) that would require undertakings to split their content into a part addressed to policyholders and a part addressed to other market participants, and (c) the requirement for internal model users to calculate and report their solvency and financial condition using the standard formula; (iii) the introduction of macro-prudential tools, including the integration of macroeconomic considerations in the ORSA and granting supervisory authorities extended powers with respect to macro-prudential concerns, allowing them to impose additional measures to reinforce insurance groups and companies' financial condition, such as restricting or suspending dividend or other payments to shareholders (including share buy-backs) and other implementing measures aimed at mitigating liquidity risk-related concerns; and (iv) amending the Group supervision regime (including the required amount of eligible own funds ('EOF') requirements and the MCR for groups). Following the publication\n\nI\n\nI\n\nby the European Parliament of its proposed amendments to the Solvency II framework on July 27, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement, on December 14, 2023, on amendments to the Solvency II directive. The provisional agreement was published on January 19, 2024 by the Council of the European Union. The text of the provisional agreement will be presented to representatives of EU member states, and to the European Parliament for approval. If approved, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament then will have to formally adopt the proposed amendments.\n\n## Recovery and resolution regimes for insurers and reinsurers\n\nIf the solvency, liquidity or the interests of clients of an insurer or reinsurer are threatened, insurance supervisors generally have broad authority to exercise various administrative powers at an early stage, including limiting or prohibiting certain activities or operations (such as the acceptance of premiums), prohibiting or on the contrary ordering asset or portfolio disposals, restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, suspending managers, and/or putting a company under special oversight or, if conditions warrant, placing the insurer into receivership, liquidation, rehabilitation or other resolution proceedings.\n\nIn addition, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector, set forth in the French Insurance Code (the 'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR is empowered to use resolution tools in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are failing or likely to fail, to avoid or limit the adverse e/ff ects on financial stability, protecting policy holders and protecting public funds from the reliance on extraordinary public financial support. These tools include portfolio transfers, the establishment of a bridge institution or the establishment of a liability management structure, as well as associated resolution actions such as temporary stays on certain payments. Under the French Resolution Framework, major French insurance groups, such as the AXA Group, are required to prepare and file with the ACPR a pre-emptive recovery plan ( plan pr\u00e9ventif de r\u00e9tablissement ) covering  insurance  holding  companies,  insurance  and reinsurance subsidiaries thereof, and any other entity of such groups, providing key services ( services indispensables ) thereto, and to ensure that such recovery plan remains up-to-date therea/f\\_t er.\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance companies with a view towards harmonizing national laws on recovery and resolution of insurers and reinsurers, ensuring that EU member states have the same tools and procedures to address failures of insurers and reinsurers, safeguarding the interests of policyholders, preserving the real economy and facilitating",

Under the proposed directive, among other things, (i) insurers and reinsurers would be subject to new recovery and resolution planning obligations, (ii) national supervisors would have new preventive powers , (iii) objectives and triggers for the resolution of failing entities would be harmonized at the EU level, (iv) a common set of tools ( e.g. , solvent run-o/ff , sale, bridge institution, asset separation, write-down and conversion) would apply, (v) safeguards would be available to shareholders and creditors, and (vi) insurers and reinsurers would be required to include certain resolution stay recognition clauses in their contracts. EU member states may also introduce additional measures and powers at the national level, as long as these are compatible with the objectives and principles set out at the EU level. On December 20, 2022, the Council of the European Union published its agreed-upon position regarding the proposed directive. Following the publication by the European Parliament of its proposed amendments to the framework for the recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance companies on July 26, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on December 14, 2023 on amendments which, among other things, require certain (re)insurance companies and groups to draw up and submit pre-emptive recovery plans to national supervisory authorities, grant resolution tools and procedures to resolution authorities (including with respect to write-down and conversion, solvent run-o/ff s and transfer tools) to address failures, notably in a cross-border context and add more detailed conditions for the use of such tools and procedures. The provisional agreement was published on January 19, 2024 by the Council of the European Union. The text will be presented to representatives of EU member states, and to the European Parliament for approval. If approved, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament then will have to formally adopt the proposed amendments.\n\n## EU-US Covered Agreement\n\nIn connection with Solvency II, on September 22, 2017, the European Union and the United States signed the 'Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance' (the 'Covered Agreement') which sets out principles governing the imposition of Group capital and supervisory standards for insurance groups headquartered in a EU member state or the United States with operations in both. The Covered Agreement entered into force on April 4, 2018. Pursuant to the Covered Agreement, the AXA Group will remain subject to group supervisory and capital requirements, as currently provided under Solvency II, with AXA's US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries remaining subject to local requirements. The Covered Agreement also addresses various regulatory information-sharing and reporting matters, as well as EU/US reinsurance market issues.\n\n## LLOYD'S\n\nFollowing the acquisition of XL Group in 2018, we have been managing, through AXA XL Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, a large underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's and, as a result of which, we are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members.\n\nFor further information on the risks related to regulatory capital requirements, see the paragraph 'The Group's or its insurance or reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## IAIS AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP ('IAIG') STATUS\n\nThe International Association of Insurance Supervisors ('IAIS') has developed several sets of supervisory requirements and actions applicable to the insurance industry, including the Common Framework ('ComFrame'), which was adopted in November 2019 and establishes supervisory standards and guidance focused on the effective group-wide supervision of IAIGs, including standards relating to group supervision, governance and internal controls, enterprise Risk Management, and recovery and resolution planning. As part of ComFrame, the IAIS is developing a globally comparable risk-based measure of capital adequacy of IAIGs, the Insurance Capital Standard (the 'ICS'). The IAIS has adopted ICS version 2.0 for a five-year monitoring period, starting in January 2020, during which IAIGs can be asked by their supervisors to compute an ICS, on a voluntary basis, for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges. The end objective for the IAIS is to have the ICS implemented as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs a/f\\_t  er the end of the monitoring period in 2024, although the IAIS is considering an alternative 'Aggregation Method' approach (based on local jurisdictional capital requirements) that may be applied in the United States and other interested jurisdictions as an outcome-equivalent approach to the ICS.\n\nIn November 2019, the IAIS adopted a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (the 'Holistic Framework'). The Holistic Framework comprises a set of enhanced supervisory measures and powers of intervention ( e.g. , ongoing supervisory requirements applied to insurers, enhanced macro-prudential surveillance, crisis management and recovery planning), an annual global monitoring exercise by the IAIS (at individual insurer and sector-wide levels), as well as implementation assessment activities aimed at assessing and mitigating the potential\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

In light of the adoption of the Holistic Framework by the IAIS, the FSB announced in December 2022 that it will discontinue the annual identification of Global Systemically Important Insurers (GSIIs), which had been suspended since 2020, and that, going forward, it will utilize assessments available through the Holistic Framework to inform its considerations of systemic risk in the insurance sector.\n\nAXA will continue to monitor the development of the Holistic Framework, ComFrame, ICS and other IAIS developments and expects the regulatory landscape with respect to insurance, reinsurance and financial markets to continue to evolve in 2024 and beyond with further legislative and regulatory initiatives.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT & BANKING ACTIVITIES\n\nAXA Investment Managers and other AXA asset management entities are subject to extensive regulations in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. These include, in Europe, Directive 2011/61/EU dated June 8, 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (as amended, 'AIFMD'), and Directive 2009/65/EC dated July 13, 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ('UCITS'), and their various implementing regulations and transposition measures. On November 25, 2021, the European Commission published legislative proposals regarding the AIFMD and the rules applicable to UCITS. On June 21, 2022, the Council of the European Union published its agreed-upon position on the European Commission's proposals to amend the AIFMD and the rules applicable to UCITS. Following the publication by the European Parliament of its proposed amendments on May 16, 2022, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on July 20, 2023 . On February 7, 2024, the provisional agreement was adopted by the European Parliament in a plenary vote. The text was adopted by the Council of the European Union on February 26, 2024. The directive will now be published in the O/ff icial Journal of the European Union and will enter into force 20 days later. EU member states will have 24 months a/f\\_t er the entry into force to transpose the rules into national legislation. In addition, AXA's investment management operations in the United States are subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThese regulations are generally designed to safeguard client assets and ensure the adequacy of disclosures concerning investment returns, the risk characteristics of invested assets in various funds, the suitability of investments for client investment objectives and risk tolerance, as well as the identity, regulatory approvals and qualifications of the investment manager. These regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthe carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment company, censures and/or fines.\n\nIn addition, certain AXA entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms, including Directive 2013/36/EU dated June 26, 2013, on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions (as amended 'CRD IV'), and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 dated June 26, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions, as amended, which set forth specific capital, governance and remuneration requirements (as amended 'CRR'). On June 27, 2019, Directive (EU) 2019/878 dated May 20, 2019 ('CRD V') and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 dated May 20, 2019 ('CRR II'), which respectively amend CRD IV and CRR, entered into force. CRD V and CRR II further implement the Basel III framework by amending various CRD and CRR provisions regarding, e.g. , holding company rules, leverage ratios, large exposures, liquidity, market risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements (including on remuneration). Most provisions of CRD V had to be transposed into national law by EU member states by December 28, 2020, and were transposed in France by Order No. 2020-1635 dated December 21, 2020, while most CRR II requirements became applicable as of June 28, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the European Commission published legislative proposals regarding the CRD and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, which aim at contributing to financial stability in the context of the post-COVID-19 crisis recovery. On November 8, 2022, the Council of the European Union published its agreed-upon position on the European Commission's proposals to amend the CRD and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013. Following the publication by the European Parliament of its proposed amendments to the CRD and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on January 24, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on June 26, 2023. This provisional agreement was approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) of the European Parliament on December 11, 2023. The plenary vote at the European Parliament is scheduled on April 22, 2024. This provisional agreement will then have to be approved by the Council of the European Union before it can come into force.\n\nMoreover, certain AXA entities are subject to Directive 2014/65/ EU dated May 15, 2014, on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID II') and Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 on markets in financial instruments, as amended ('MiFIR' and, together with MiFID II, and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, the 'MiFID II Package') which entered into force in 2018. The MiFID II Package, which was designed to better integrate the European Union's financial markets and increase cross-border investments, market transparency and investor protection, imposes a wide variety of new requirements including with respect to trading/",

The European Commission conducted a public consultation on the review of the MiFID II Package, which expired in May 2020, and consequently revised the MiFID II Package in successive Commission delegated regulations published on March 26, 2021, July 14, 2021 and August 2, 2021. These regulations require investment firms that manufacture and distribute financial instruments to, among other things, (i) clarify that their processes and internal control systems appropriately reflect sustainability risks, (ii) confirm that they have the knowledge and technical capacities to analyze those risks, and (iii) confirm that, for each financial instrument that is intended to be distributed to clients seeking to invest in financial instruments with a sustainability-related profile, sustainability factors are considered in (a) the product approval process and (b) other product governance and oversight arrangements.\n\nIn addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') simultaneously conducted a public consultation on several issues arising out of the MiFiD II Package and published its MiFIR review report on March 23, 2021, specifically on the obligations to report transactions and reference data, with a view towards simplifying the current reporting regimes whilst ensuring the quality and usability of the reported data.\n\nA legislative review of certain aspects of the MiFID II Package, related to market structure topics, was proposed by the European Commission on November 25, 2021. On March 9, 2022, ESMA published its assessment of, and recommendations on, the European Commission's proposal. Following the publication by the European Parliament of its proposed amendments to the MiFID II Package on March 2, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on June 29, 2023. The provisional agreement was published on October 18, 2023 by the Council of the European Union. This provisional agreement will have to be approved first by the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union (COREPER II) of the Council of the European Union and the Committee on Economic and Monetary A/ff airs (ECON) of the European Parliament before being adopted in a plenary vote at the European Parliament, and at the Council of the European Union.\n\nSome AXA entities are directly or indirectly subject to Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 dated November 26, 2014, on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation') which entered\n\ninto force in 2018, the objective of which is to enhance retail investor protection by standardizing the information through predefined key information documents. While the PRIIPs Regulation has already impacted insurance undertakings, banks and asset managers, its technical regulatory standards are under review by the European Commission, and review of the PRIIPS Regulations under consideration by the European Union in order to reach better convergence with other EU regulations. On May 2, 2022, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published a report presenting to the European Commission its technical advice on the PRIIPs Regulation. On May 24, 2023, the European Commission (i) adopted a retail investment strategy aimed at empowering retail investors to make investment decisions that are aligned with their needs and preferences and ensuring that they are treated fairly and duly protected, and (ii) published its proposal for a regulation amending the PRIIPs Regulation in order to, among other things, protect retail investors from misleading marketing communications and practices and prevent undue costs. The vote of the Committee on Economic and Monetary A/ff airs (ECON) of the European Parliament is expected to take place on March 20, 2024, before being discussed in a plenary session at the European Parliament in April 2024.\n\nThe European Union (Regulation (EU) 648/2012 dated July 4, 2012, also referred to as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation - 'EMIR') and similar US regulations (principally under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), as amended from time to time, establish various requirements and prescriptive guidelines which impact operations, liquidity and credit Risk Management for derivatives. AXA's asset managers and banks, which manage derivatives on behalf of various AXA Group a/ff iliates (including on behalf of AXA), operate in conformity with these rules, in line with the Group's overall financial risk framework. On December 7, 2022, the European Commission presented a proposal to review EMIR in order to make the clearing services landscape more attractive and resilient, to support the European Union's open strategic autonomy and to preserve the European Union's financial stability. On February 7, 2024, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement which among other things, strengthens cooperation, coordination and information sharing among supervisors and ESMA, while ensuring an appropriate division of tasks between national authorities and ESMA. The provisional agreement was published on February 13, 2024 by the Council of the European Union. This provisional agreement needs to be approved by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament before going through the formal adoption procedure.\n\nFor additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

The GDPR applies to both EU and non-EU companies, if the latter are o/ff ering goods and services or monitoring the behavior of individuals in the European Union. As insurance and reinsurance companies need a EU license for providing insurance services in the European Union, the GDPR applies primarily, in the insurance and reinsurance sector, to companies operating in the European Union.\n\nIn France, the EU Data Protection Reform has beentransposed notably  by Law No. 2018-493 regarding personal data protection, which entered into force on May 25, 2018, and various implementing measures, including Decree No. 2018-687 dated August 1, 2018.\n\nFor further information concerning data protection, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Personal data transfers to non-EU jurisdictions (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission)\n\nIn 2020, the European Union Court of Justice ('ECJ') invalidated a data transfer mechanism, referred to as the 'EU-US Privacy Shield,' which was created in July 2016 and had allowed, under certain conditions, for the transfer of personal information for commercial purposes from companies in the European Union to companies in the United States which had signed up to the US\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDepartment of Commerce 'Privacy Shield Principles'. The ECJ also required that supplementary measures be considered for other mechanisms for data transfers to any non-EU jurisdiction (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission).\n\nAs banks, insurance and reinsurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group has continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data between companies within the AXA Group. We currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the US and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required. In July 2023, the European Commission announced a final adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the 'EU-US DPF'), a data transfer mechanism that replaces the invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield. As with the EU-US Privacy Shield, the EU-US DPF is limited to entities subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission or Department of Transportation, though other US statutory bodies recognized by the EU may be included in future annexes of the EU-US DPF. Because of this, the AXA Group believes that it may continue to rely on standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules as data transfer mechanisms to transfer data from the EU to the United States and other non-EU jurisdictions. For further information concerning transatlantic data transfers, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\nIn February 2020, EIOPA finalized its 'Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers', which national supervisors have been enforcing since January 2021. In addition, on October 8, 2020, EIOPA issued an additional set of guidelines, the 'Guidelines on information and communication technology security and governance', aimed at promoting the operational resilience of the digital operations of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Both sets of guidelines provide guidance to national competent authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings on the information and communication technology ('ICT') security and governance requirements envisaged under Solvency II, and have applied since July 1, 2021. AXA Group has tracked the progress of both sets of guidelines, provided feedback to EIOPA and confirmed the alignment of its practices or strategy with the guidelines.",

        "page_content": "## SHARES, SHARE CAPITAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n7.3 GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nRegulation 2022/2254/EU of December 14, 2022 on digital resilience for the financial sector ('DORA') was adopted by the European institutions and will come into e/ff ect in January 2025. DORA is designed to establish a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial institutions, including  insurance  and  reinsurance  undertakings  and intermediaries, credit institutions, investment firms, alternative investment fund managers and UCITS management companies. This framework is aimed at enhancing the ICT Risk Management conducted by financial institutions, establishing a thorough testing of ICT systems, increasing supervisors' awareness of cyber risks and ICT-related incidents faced by financial institutions, as well as introducing powers for competent supervisory authorities to oversee risks stemming from financial institutions' dependency on ICT third-party service providers. DORA also creates a consistent incident reporting mechanism in order to strengthen supervisory e/ff ectiveness.\n\nObligations under DORA are detailed by regulatory technical standards ('RTS') and implementing technical standards ('ITS'), aiming at harmonizing requirements and facilitating implementation. On June 19, 2023, the ESAs published the first batch of dra/f\\_t   RTS and ITS, providing details around, among other things, ICT security tools, policies and procedures, policies on the use of third-party ICT services concerning critical or important functions, criteria for the classification of ICT-related incidents, and register of agreements with third-party ICT service providers. Those dra/f\\_t  RTS and ITS were open to public consultation from June 19, 2023 until September 11, 2023. On January 17, 2024, the ESAs published the first set of final dra/f\\_t s of RTS and ITS and submitted them to the European Commission for adoption.\n\nOn December 8, 2023, the ESAs launched a public consultation on the second batch of policy mandates under DORA, which includes four draft RTS, one set of draft ITS and two sets of guidelines. These policy instruments aim to harmonize the legal framework in areas such as major ICT-related incident reporting, digital operational resilience testing, ICT third-party Risk Management and oversight over critical ICT third-party providers. This public consultation will run until March 4, 2024. The ESAs expect to submit these dra/f\\_t  RTS, ITS and guidelines to the European Commission by June 17, 2024 for adoption.\n\n## Financial Data Access (FIDA)\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the European Commission published a regulatory proposal for the Financial Data Access ('FIDA')\n\nframework (1) . The purpose of FIDA is to establish rules relating to the (i) access, sharing and use of certain categories of customer data in financial services and (ii) authorization and operation of financial information service providers. Once finalized, FIDA is expected to create a framework for controlled and consentbased sharing of financial data, such as financial data contained in insurance-based investment products and non-Life insurance products, and therefore to expand the open banking datasharing obligations (which currently apply only to payments accounts data) to nearly all financial services data. The vote of the Committee on Economic and Monetary A/ff airs (ECON) of the European Parliament is expected to take place on March 21, 2024.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Artificial intelligence act\n\nOn April 21, 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence (the 'AI Act') (2) , which follows a risk-based approach and aims to achieve four objectives: (i) ensuring that artificial intelligence ('AI') systems placed and used in the European Union market are safe and comply with existing laws on  rights and  values of the European Union, (ii) ensuring legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI, (iii) enhancing governance and  enforcement of existing laws on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems and (iv) facilitating the development of a single market for AI .\n\nA  provisional agreement was reached on December 9, 2023 between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The provisional agreement amends the AI Act with the following main new elements: (i) rules on high-impact, general-purpose AI models and high-risk AI systems that can cause systemic risks , (ii) a revised system of  enforcement powers , (iii) extension of the list of prohibitions  and (iv) a fundamental rights impact assessment by high-risk system providers prior to putting an AI system into use. The provisional agreement was published on February 2, 2024 by the Council of the European Union. On February 13, 2024, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament voted in favor of the provisional agreement on the AI Act.\n\nThe final text of the AI Act still needs to be formally adopted by both the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The AI Act is expected to apply starting from 2026.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

At this stage, a decision of the parliamentary committee is still pending with respect to the AI Liability Directive.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nSolvency II sets out the remuneration policy principles and governance requirements to be implemented by European insurers and specifies that the companies subject to Solvency II must adopt a written remuneration policy compliant with a number of principles set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 dated October 10, 2014 (as amended, the 'Solvency II Regulation')  which  promotes  sound  and  effective  Risk Management and does not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk tolerance limits of the Company. In this context, AXA has reviewed and formalized its existing Group remuneration policy, identified the individuals responsible for managing and having an impact on the Group's overall risk profile, and defined a consistent approach to manage remuneration of individuals in charge of control functions. AXA's Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee is in charge of overseeing the design of the remuneration policy and remuneration practices, their implementation and operation.\n\nSince 2008, there have been a variety of proposals with respect to executive compensation practices at financial institutions including from the FSB and other regulatory bodies. Certain of these proposals have been embodied in regulation or legislation, while others remain best practice recommendations.\n\nIn  2009,  the  FSB  published  the  'Principles  for  Sound Compensation Practices', together with implementation standards. Among the matters covered in these standards and principles are a variety of mechanisms (including minimum recommended deferrals of cash bonuses, greater use of longterm equity grants rather than cash as a form of compensation, minimum vesting/deferral periods, and performance criteria for vesting of long-term awards) that are designed to ensure an appropriate alignment of interests between (i) Executive Management and certain employees (such as traders) who can have a potentially significant impact on the nature and duration of risks incurred, (ii) the Company and (iii) shareholders. The FSB's principles were supplemented by additional guidance published by the FSB in 2018, which has been developed in the form of recommendations regarding improvements in compensation practices and tools that could be used to reduce misconduct risk and address misconduct incidents.\n\nIn addition, on April 7, 2020, EIOPA published an opinion on the supervision of remuneration principles in the insurance sector. This opinion is based on EIOPA's views that the remuneration principles defined in the Solvency II Regulation are high-level and leave considerable discretion to undertakings and supervisory authorities, and aims at ensuring that consistent practices be applied in the application of the remuneration principles included in the Solvency II framework. As a result, EIOPA's opinion sets out guidance to national supervisory authorities on how to challenge the application of certain remuneration principles, and focuses on employees identified as potential higher profile risk-takers including, subject to certain variable compensation thresholds, (i) members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking, (ii) Executive Directors who e/ff  ectively run the undertaking, (iii) key function holders within the meaning of the Solvency II regulations ( i.e. , Risk Management, compliance, internal audit and actuarial), and (iv) employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the undertakings' risk profile. EIOPA has indicated that it will begin monitoring the application of this opinion by national supervisory authorities two years a/f\\_t er its publication ( i.e. , a/f\\_t er April 7, 2022). As of December 31, 2023, no further guidance from national supervisory authorities has been published.\n\nThese principles and standards are reflected in a variety of regulations and legislative initiatives that have been enacted over the past few years in various jurisdictions where the Group does business. While these restrictions do not apply uniformly to the Group across the various jurisdictions where it does business, the Group has largely aligned its global executive compensation practices with these standards and principles, and conducts regular reviews of its compensation practices and policies in light of these standards as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The application of these principles and standards may vary among the di/ff erent actors in the financial sector (such as banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity funds and hedge funds) and across the various jurisdictions where the Group does business, which may give rise to certain competitive issues for the Group, including by a/ff ecting the Group's ability to attract and retain top-rate talents.\n\n## Evolution of accounting standards\n\nUntil year-end 2022, policyholders' liabilities were accounted for according to IFRS 4, which generally allowed the use of a wide variety of accounting practices for insurance contracts, reflecting di/ff  erent national accounting requirements, and the continuation of accounting policies applied prior to conversion to IFRS. On May 18, 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') issued the IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, which replaced IFRS 4, finalizing a project of the IASB to develop a single and consistent approach to the accounting for insurance contracts. In particular, IFRS 17 requires insurance obligations to be accounted\n\nI\n\nI",

Following amendments issued by the IASB on June 25, 2020, the updated IFRS 17 became e/ff ective for annual periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January 1, 2023. The amended version of IFRS 17 was adopted by the European Union on November 19, 2021 with an exemption, used by the Group, setting forth that a company may choose not to apply the annual cohort requirement prescribed in IFRS 17 to certain groups of contracts under certain circumstances. The Group has begun applying IFRS 17 as from January 1, 2023 with a transition date at January 1, 2022, corresponding to the beginning of the Annual Reporting period immediately preceding the date of initial application, and restating retrospectively the comparative period corresponding to the consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2022.\n\nIn parallel with IFRS 17, the Group is applying (from January 1, 2023 onward) IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments. The published e/ff  ective date of IFRS 9 was January 1, 2018. However, given the interaction between financial assets and insurance liabilities, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 4 allowing, under certain conditions, entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 to defer the implementation of IFRS 9 until the e/ff ective date of IFRS 17, but no later than January 1, 2023, so that qualifying insurers could apply both standards for the first time simultaneously. The Group was eligible for this temporary exemption and decided to apply it.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 resulted in significant accounting changes. The nature and e/ff ects of these changes are disclosed in the Note 1.2.1.1 IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments within the Section 6.6 Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives\n\nThere are various initiatives at the French, EU and international levels with respect to climate change and sustainable finance, which generally aim at proposing reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting investment activities, disclosure requirements and requirements relating to the inclusion of (i) Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') considerations in insurance and Asset Management products and advice and (ii) climate change in stress testing.\n\n## Disclosure requirements with respect to climate change and sustainable finance\n\n## French national framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies\n\nIn France, the national framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies (including financial institutions) has been successively strengthened by (i) article 173-VI of Law No. 2015-992 dated August 17, 2015, on the energy transition for green growth ('article 173') and (ii) article 29 of Law No. 20191147 dated November 8, 2019 on energy and climate ('article 29') and the decree implementing article 29 published on May 27, 2021.\n\nArticle 173 imposes increased transparency obligations on investors (including institutional investors), requiring them to disclose how they incorporate ESG objectives, including the specific consideration of climate risk, into their investment strategies and the measures implemented to support the energy and ecological transition.\n\nArticle 29 maintains the current disclosure framework under article 173 and strengthens certain of its provisions, particularly with respect to the publication of risks related to climate change and biodiversity erosion. The decree implementing article 29 published on May 27, 2021, provides a framework for extrafinancial reporting by market participants, which will include certain entities of the AXA Group, and defines how ESG qualitative information and the means implemented to support the energy and ecological transition are to be presented. The instruction n\u00b02022-I-24 published by the ACPR on December 14, 2022 provides additional guidance about, and includes templates with respect to, the disclosure requirements set forth above.\n\n## French national framework for greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements\n\nSince 2012, companies (including financial institutions) with a registered o/ff ice located in France and employing more than 500 employees have been required to prepare, establish and publish a report on greenhouse gas emissions ('GHG emissions') ( bilan des \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre (BEGES)). This report (the 'GHG Emissions report') had to include a summary of actions planned to reduce such GHG emissions. Between 2012 and 2022, the GHG Emissions report covered only Scope 1 GHG emissions and Scope 2 GHG emissions.\n\nThe framework for establishing the GHG Emissions report has been enhanced, notably by article 28 of Law No. 2019-1147 dated November 8, 2019 on energy and climate ('article 28') and Decree No. 2022-982 dated July 1, 2022. Article 28, which entered into force in November 2020, replaced the summary of actions expected to reduce GHG emissions included in the GHG Emissions report with a transition plan presenting the goals, means and measures expected to be implemented in order to reduce GHG emissions. Decree No. 2022-982 dated July 1, 2022, applicable as from January 1, 2023, among other things (i) introduced consolidation rules according to which a consolidated GHG Emissions report (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a consolidated transition plan) could be published for all companies within the same group subject to this disclosure requirement ( i.e. , companies (including financial institutions) with a registered o/ff ice located in France and employing more than 500 employees) and (ii) broadened the scope of the GHG emissions to be included in the GHG Emissions report to include Scope 3 GHG emissions.\n\n## European framework for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2089 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation in connection with the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks and sustainabilityrelated disclosures for the benchmarks was adopted on November 27, 2019, and seeks to, among other things, ensure the integrity of low-carbon benchmarks .\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

The SFDR sets out harmonized rules for financial market participants, which includes certain AXA Group entities, on transparency with respect to the integration of sustainability risks, the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts of market participants' processes and the provision of sustainability-related information of certain financial products.\n\nOn April 6, 2022, the European Commission adopted a delegated regulation supplementing the SFDR with respect to RTS for the content and presentation of disclosure requirements under the SFDR, which was published in the O/ff icial Journal of the European Union as the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 on July 25, 2022. The Joint Committee of the ESAs published a set of questions and answers regarding the RTS on November 17, 2022. The RTS became applicable as of January 1, 2023. On October 31, 2022, following a final report by the Joint Committee of the ESAs, the European Commission adopted amendments to the RTS to require financial market participants to disclose the extent to which their portfolios are exposed to gas and nuclear-related activities (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/363).\n\nOn December 4, 2023, the Joint Committee of the ESAs published a final report recommending amendments to the RTS, including, among other things, adding new social indicators, streamlining the framework for the disclosure of principal adverse impacts of investment decisions on the environment and society and introducing new product disclosures regarding 'greenhouse gas emissions reduction' targets. The European Commission is expected to study the dra/f\\_t  RTS and decide whether to adopt them within a period of three months following the publication of this report.\n\n## European framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies - Taxonomy Regulation\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') was adopted on June 18, 2020. The Taxonomy Regulation applies, in particular, to undertakings (such as the Company) that are required to publish a non-financial statement. The Taxonomy Regulation establishes the criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable.\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 dated June 4, 2021 supplements the Taxonomy Regulation by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to other environmental objectives. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 was successively amended by (i) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214\n\nI\n\nI\n\ndated March 9, 2022, regarding economic activities in certain energy sectors and (ii) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 dated June 27, 2023 supplementing the technical screening criteria for certain activities that were not initially identified as eligible.\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 dated July 6, 2021 supplements the Taxonomy Regulation by, among other things, specifying the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed in a non-financial statement. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 was further amended by (i) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 dated March 9, 2022, regarding certain specific public disclosures and (ii) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 dated June 27, 2023, which supplements the Taxonomy Regulation by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any other environmental objectives, and which amends Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 regarding specific public disclosures for those economic activities.\n\n## European framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies - CSRD\n\nOn April 21, 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability reporting (the 'CSRD') which, with respect to corporate sustainability reporting, amends the Accounting Directive, Directive 2004/109/EC (the Transparency Directive, as amended), Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\nThe CSRD (Directive (EU) 2022/2464 dated December 14, 2022) was published in the O/ff icial Journal of the European Union on December 16, 2022 and entered into force on January 5, 2023. The CSRD introduced, among other things, new sustainabilityrelated reporting requirements for companies, including (i) the principal risks the issuer faces with respect to sustainability matters and how the issuer manages those risks, (ii) the resilience of the issuer's business model and strategy in light of risks related to sustainability matters, (iii) the opportunities that sustainability matters may present for the issuer, (iv) the issuer's plan(s) to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the global warming limit of 1.5\u00b0C set by the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement that entered into force on November 4, 2016, (v) a description of the targets set by the issuer related to sustainability matters and the progress the issuer has made towards achieving those targets, (vi) the role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies with regards to sustainability matters, and (vii) the due diligence process(es) implemented by the issuer with respect to sustainability matters.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, the European Commission adopted the delegated act specifying the European sustainability reporting",

The ESRS cover a range of environmental, social, and governance issues, including climate change, biodiversity and human rights, and provide information for investors to understand the sustainability impact of the companies in which they invest. They also take account of discussions with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in order to ensure interoperability between EU and global standards.\n\nOn December 22, 2023, such delegated act was published in the O/ff  icial Journal of the European Union (1) . It entered into force on December 25, 2023 and became applicable starting on January 1, 2024. The CSRD and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 apply to AXA as from January 1, 2024, with respect and for the financial years beginning on January 1, 2024.\n\nIn France, the CSRD has been transposed notably by (i) Order No. 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 relating to the publication and certification of information with respect to sustainability matters, and requirements with respect to environmental, social and corporate governance matters of commercial companies and (ii) Decree No. 2023-1394 dated December 30, 2023.\n\n## European framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies - CSDD Directive\n\nOn February 23, 2022, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence (the 'CSDD Directive'). The CSDD Directive aims at, among other things, improving corporate governance practices to better integrate Risk Management and mitigation processes of human rights and environmental risks and impacts into corporate strategies, and improve access to remedies for those a/ff ected by adverse human rights and environmental impacts of corporate behavior.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on its position and published a compromise text, with proposed amendments to the CSDD Directive which result, among other things, in narrowing the scope of the CSDD Directive by increasing the net revenue and employee thresholds, rejecting the European Commission's proposal that due diligence should fall under the directors' fiduciary duty of care and leaving to each EU member state the decision as to whether the obligations set forth in the CSDD Directive should apply to companies in the financial sector.\n\nFollowing the publication by the European Parliament of its agreed-upon position regarding the CSDD Directive on June 1, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on December 14, 2023, which, among other things, frames the scope of the CSDD Directive, clarifies the liabilities for non-compliant companies, defines the di/ff erent penalties, and completes the list of rights and prohibitions that companies should respect. The provisional agreement reached between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament was submitted to the vote of the Council of the European Union on February 28, 2024. The qualified majority at the Council of the European Union was not reached. The procedure with respect to the CSDD Directive is still unknown at this stage.\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe Group supports and implements the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Group publishes voluntary information in line with these recommendations, which include, among others, recommendations with respect to:\n\n- \u25a0 disclosure of actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the Group's businesses, strategy, and financial planning;\n- \u25a0 disclosure of governance on climate risks and opportunities; and\n- \u25a0 disclosure of metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities.\n\n## Requirements relating to the inclusion of Environmental, Social and Governance considerations in insurance and Asset Management products and advice\n\nOn April 30, 2019, EIOPA issued a technical opinion to the European Commission with respect to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the delegated acts under the Solvency II Directive and Directive (EU) 2016/97 dated January 20, 2016, on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'). On September 30, 2019, EIOPA issued its opinion on sustainability under Solvency II framework.\n\nBased on the public consultation conducted by the European Commission between June 2020 and July 2020, the European Commission adopted on April 21, 2021, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 amending the regime for the integration of sustainability factors, risks and preferences into the product oversight  and  governance  requirements  for  insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and into the rules on conduct of business and investment advice for insurance-based investment products. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 became applicable on August 2, 2022.\n\nAt the international level, the IAIS completed in January 2021 a public consultation on a draft Application Paper on the supervision of climate-related risks in the insurance sector, developed to support insurance supervisory authorities in their e/ff orts to integrate climate-related risks into their respective supervisory frameworks.\n\n## Requirements in connection with climate change in stress testing\n\nThe ACPR conducted an initial climate pilot exercise that incorporated certain climate change scenarios and assumptions into stress testing, the first results of which were published in May 2021. Pursuant to these first results, the exposure of French financial institutions to the sectors that are most impacted by the risks related to the ecological transition (as identified in the climate pilot exercise) was relatively limited. In February 2022, the ACPR published a report analyzing the evolution of measures taken by the industry in addressing climate risks. Further, the ACPR and the AMF published joint reports monitoring French financial institutions' climate commitments in November 2021 and November 2022, noting that the implementation of those commitments remains insu/ff icient. On July 6, 2023, the ACPR announced the launch of its second climate stress test covering the insurance sector and published the assumptions and expectations of such stress test. The results will be the subject of\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 dated June 8, 2016 (as amended, the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), which entered into force on January 1, 2018, as well as the EU Benchmark Regulation as incorporated into UK law as from January 1, 2021 (the 'UK Benchmark Regulation' and, together with the EU Benchmark Regulation, the 'Benchmark Regulation') imposed additional requirements on the provision of financial market-related benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK.\n\nSeveral interbank market benchmarks have since been designated as critical benchmarks under the Benchmark Regulation, including LIBOR, EURIBOR and EONIA, and their related benchmark methodologies made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks have been discontinued, including EONIA, which ceased to be published on January 3, 2022, and LIBOR (publication of most LIBOR settings ceased on December 31, 2021, and publication of most USD LIBOR settings ceased on June 30, 2023). In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation was published on February 10, 2021, and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the operation of financial markets in the EU. This new statutory benchmark would replace other benchmarks used in contracts and financial instruments, which (i) have not been renegotiated before the date of cessation of the benchmark, and (ii) contain either no contractual replacement (or so-called 'fallback provision'), or a fallback provision which is deemed unsuitable be supervisors. The European Commission has designated statutory replacements for EONIA and CHF LIBOR. The FCA has also exercised certain powers under the UK Benchmark Regulation to compel the publication of (i) the 3-month GBP LIBOR settings on the basis of a changed or 'synthetic' methodology until endMarch 2024, a/f\\_t er which publication will cease permanently and (ii) the 1-, 3- and 6-month USD LIBOR settings on the basis of a changed or 'synthetic' methodology until end-September 2024, a/f\\_t  er which publication will cease permanently.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nBecause these reforms affected the whole financial services sector, the transition to new benchmarks created industrywide risks . AXA conducted a Group-wide project to manage this transition and manage the impacts of benchmark changes, as well as implications for our capital models, Risk Management e/ff  orts, investment strategies and product design, among others.\n\n## Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment\n\nThe Group's insurance, reinsurance, asset management and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services. In the European Union, initiatives related to the financial sector include in particular the IDD, MiFID II and the PRIIPs Regulation. Similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions where the Group operates, and these initiatives are likely to continue to expand, resulting in increased operational compliance costs to meet regulatory expectations.\n\n## Consumer protection\n\nThe IDD superseded the Insurance Mediation Directive and is designed to improve consumer protection by ensuring that all distributors of insurance products operate on a level playing field. The main provisions of the IDD relate to enhanced professional requirements ( e.g. , continuing training and development for distributors), conduct of business rules, conflicts of interest (relating to fees, commissions and bonuses), increased disclosure and transparency and extensive product governance requirements. It also includes additional requirements for the sale of insurance products with investment elements in order to ensure that policyholders receive a similar level of protection as buyers of retail investment products regulated under MiFID II ( e.g. , when providing advice, distributors have to assess whether the insurance-based investment product is suitable for the customer).\n\nThe IDD entered into force on October 1, 2018, while MiFID II and the PRIIPs Regulation entered into force at the beginning of January 2018.\n\n## Anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international sanctions compliance\n\nFinancial crime compliance programs of financial institutions (anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international sanctions compliance) continue to be a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, with increasingly significant penalties imposed for compliance failures. In particular, French Law No. 2016-1691 dated December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy, known as 'Sapin II', which was introduced in June 2017, included new requirements for all large French companies to establish internal procedures to prevent and detect acts of corruption",

Sapin II also established a new French anti-corruption agency ( Agence fran\u00e7aise anticorruption ), which was given strengthened supervisory and enforcement powers.\n\nFurthermore, Orders No. 2020-1342 of November 4, 2020 and No. 2020-115 of February 12, 2020, enhanced the requirements for French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures and prevent and detect acts of corruption committed in France and abroad, while strengthening the supervisory and enforcement powers of supervisory authorities. In addition, French Law No. 2022-401 dated March 21, 2022 amended certain provisions of Sapin II to improve the protection of whistleblowers and became e/ff ective on September 1, 2022.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the European Commission presented a package of legislation to strengthen the European Union's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime (the 'AML Package'), which consisted of (i) a regulatory proposal establishing a new anti-money laundering authority in the European Union, which would have the ability to impose sanctions and penalties (1) , (ii) a proposal to update existing rules on information accompanying transfers of funds, which aims to make transfers of crypto-assets more transparent and fully traceable (2) , (iii) a regulatory proposal on anti-money-laundering requirements for the private sector (3) and (iv) a proposal for a directive on anti-money-laundering mechanisms (4) .\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 of the European Parliament and of the Council on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets was adopted. This regulation establishes rules (i) with respect to the information on payers and payees accompanying transfers of funds, and on the information on originators and beneficiaries accompanying transfers of crypto-assets, for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering and terrorist financing and (ii) on internal policies, procedures and controls to ensure implementation of restrictive measures.\n\nOn December 13, 2023, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement with respect to the regulatory proposal establishing a new anti-money laundering authority in the European Union. The provisional agreement was published on February 14, 2024 by the Council of the European Union. The text of the provisional agreement\n\nwill be presented to representatives of EU member states, and to the European Parliament for approval. If approved, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament then will have to formally adopt the proposed amendments.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement with respect to the proposal for a regulation on anti-moneylaundering requirements for the private sector and the proposal for a directive on anti-money-laundering mechanisms. The provisional agreements were published on February 12, 2024 and February 13, 2024, respectively, by the Council of the European Union. The text of the provisional agreements will be presented to representatives of EU member states, and to the European Parliament for approval. If approved, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament then will have to formally adopt the proposed amendments.\n\nIn light of these and other initiatives with respect to compliance requirements, Management believes that the complexity and risks for international financial institutions like AXA in this area will likely continue to increase, and that compliance costs will also increase accordingly.\n\n## Litigation environment\n\nThe litigation environment in which the Group operates also continues to evolve. In continental Europe, the introduction of class actions, including in France in 2014, has, and is likely to continue to, increase litigation risks and costs for insurers, asset managers and other financial institutions. Most recently, the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 dated November 25, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at the EU level aims at enabling qualified entities to seek remedy through representative actions against infringements of provisions of EU law in a variety of areas (including data protection and financial services), in order to provide an e/ff ective and e/ff icient way of protecting the collective interests of consumers. This directive was required to be transposed by EU member states by December 25, 2022, for a scheduled application date of June 25, 2023. A bill to transpose this directive was introduced before the National Assembly on December 15, 2022 (5) and adopted. It was transmitted to the Senate on March 9, 2023 for review (6) .\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, holders of property and casualty insurance policies increasingly seek coverage for losses caused by the governmental actions and measures implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdown measures. A number of lawsuits have been and may be introduced against insurers, such as AXA, in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nFor additional information, please see 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' and 'We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/ or other proceedings which may affect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' and Section 5.8 'Other material risks - Regulatory risks' of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## AXA Group Tax Policy\n\nBoth as a multinational company and as a provider of investments and savings products, the AXA Group follows a responsible and transparent approach on tax issues.\n\nThe taxes AXA pays are an important part of its wider economic and social impact and play a key role in the development of countries where it operates (1) . AXA regards it as a critical element of its commitment to grow in a sustainable, responsible and socially inclusive way.\n\nAXA also squares its responsibilities as a co-operative, compliant taxpayer in each and every country in which it operates, with the need to support competitive business growth - serving all its stakeholders including investors, suppliers and employees. We seek an open dialogue with our stakeholders, including relevant tax authorities, our shareholders and regulators.\n\nThis group tax policy is shared and agreed with the Group Audit Committee once a year.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS IN RELATION TO AXA AS A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY\n\n## The AXA Group's approach to tax issues\n\nIn the countries where it operates, AXA is both a taxpayer and a tax collector, given that many specific taxes are levied on insurance and reinsurance policies and collected from our customers as part of the insurance, reinsurance and Asset Management revenues while others are remitted to the various state and federal administrations around the world.\n\nThe tax function is organized within the Group to ensure full compliance with all tax legislation in the countries where AXA operates. In addition to the Group Tax Department based in France, all key operational entities/countries/geographic zones\n\nhave a tax team in charge of ensuring that tax regulations are well understood and fully satisfied by the entities.\n\nAs a part of the global internal risk assessment, a specific tax internal control program is implemented. These controls must be reported and documented by each team in scope to ensure full compliance. There is a yearly update made to the Group Audit Committee around tax topics with a specific focus on ongoing tax audits and litigation.\n\nA Tax Code of Ethics, agreed between Group Tax Department and local tax teams, highlights the key principles guiding the actions of the various tax teams:\n\n- \u25a0 to remain up to date with respect to applicable laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 to comply with tax laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 to maintain a good relationship with the local tax authorities; and\n- \u25a0 not to engage in aggressive tax driven transactions that could compromise the good reputation of the Group, or otherwise put the Group at risk.\n\nWithin the objective of keeping good relationship with tax authorities, the AXA Group may seek, when necessary, certainty in advance from tax authorities to confirm an applicable tax treatment based on full disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nThe satisfaction of this Code of Ethics is a prerequisite of the activities performed by all AXA tax teams and gives rise to an annual certification by each head of tax, which is provided to the Group Tax Department. In addition, a bi-annual tax review process of each key entity or business line is performed by the Group Tax Department in connection with each local team. During these reviews, specific attention is given to tax audits and associated tax risks as well as market positions on tax matters\n\nI\n\nI",

These reviews o/ff er a global framework for the tax teams to identify, analyze, control, and report tax risks.\n\nLastly, an International Tax Committee composed of various senior tax executives within AXA tax teams meets every quarter to ensure consistency in approach on some technical topics, as well as agreements on guidelines, when necessary, connected to specific items.\n\nAs an international group operating in several countries, the AXA Group is subject to various tax regimes and regulations and takes into account any changes in tax law. AXA is specifically vigilant about the changes that could result in higher tax expenses and payments, higher compliance costs or that may a/ff ect the AXA Group's tax liability, return on investments and business operations. In particular, please see the paragraph 'Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations' in Section 5.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhen considering how AXA entities structure commercial arrangements, tax implications are analyzed in parallel with other consequences such as capital e/ff iciency and legal and regulatory aspects when deciding between potential alternative arrangements.\n\nAXA has no licensed insurance or operating business activities in the countries specifically identified as non-cooperative jurisdictions (1) under French and European rules, except in Panama and in Russia. The presence in these jurisdictions is purely driven by operational purposes. In Panama, AXA still holds two non-consolidated operating companies (one providing assistance services to local customers, and the other delivering health claim services) employing circa 40 people.\n\nIn Russia, AXA holds a minority financial investment in Reso Garantia, a Russian insurance company.\n\nMore globally, AXA does not use non-cooperative jurisdictions to avoid taxes on operational activities performed elsewhere.\n\nAny presence in countries in which AXA operates with tax rates lower than France are driven by business operations. Since the acquisition of the XL Group in September 2018, AXA  has a material presence and substance in Bermuda with nearly 200 employees working for AXA XL there. Despite the fact that Bermuda has historically been a low-tax jurisdiction, it is a center of expertise\n\nand one of the key locations of the worldwide reinsurance market.  It is not considered as a non-cooperative jurisdiction according to the French and European Union laws. This presence is mainly driven by local capital management regulation enabling flexibility on the required capital for reinsurance activities and AXA supports the Economic Substance legislation enacted in this country. It should be noted that Bermuda enacted at the end of 2023 a tax reform to create a corporate tax at 15% as from January 1, 2025. This situation will in no way change how the AXA Group is managed on the tax side. AXA will continue to tax its operations in the various countries where operational profits are made.\n\n## Disclosure on tax matters and information on taxes connected with the Group's activities in each country\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in compliance with IFRS standards (as disclosed in  Section 6.6 Note 1 'Accounting principles'  of this Annual Report). Accounting for income taxes recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of the entity's assets and liabilities, as required by IAS 12 (see Section 6.6 - Note 1.17.1 'Income taxes'  of this Annual Report).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements present the reconciliation between the theoretical tax charge and the e/ff ective tax charge under IFRS. All di/ff erences are fully explained (see Section 6.6 - Note 17 'Tax' of this Annual Report). It should be noted that in many jurisdictions where AXA operates, the income and capital gains on savings products benefit from a favorable tax treatment, also when such products are included in Life insurance products. This leads to a lower e/ff ective tax rate for Life insurance companies.\n\nIn addition to the details reported around the Group e/ff ective tax rate, AXA reports substantial information on the impacts of any change in local tax regulations on its business, as well as details of the tax burden per line of business and per country. AXA's income tax expenses/benefits are extensively disclosed in the Annual Report and are broken down by business segment and country. For each, a dedicated paragraph provides a comment about the line related to Tax Income (see Section 2.3 'Activity report' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

This report is available on the AXA website (www.axa.com) at the end of the AXA Group Tax Policy page. AXA updates this report annually and the most recent version was issued in May 2023.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS OF ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE GROUP\n\n## Activities of the Group\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to strict regulations and rigorous control in each territory in which AXA operates. In addition to these regulations, AXA has developed a set of detailed internal standards that applies to all Group entities that are managed or controlled by AXA, regardless of the activities undertaken by the entity or its ownership structure.\n\nAccording to these internal standards, Chief Executive O/ff icers must ensure that sta/ff  are fully conversant, and comply with applicable laws, mandatory Codes of Conduct, rules and regulations (including applicable tax laws and regulations) relevant to their area of operations.\n\nThis means that local senior management must appreciate the tax implications of the activities in their entity. The main considerations are:\n\n- \u25a0 compliance with the taxation of employees in the territory in which they are employed;\n- \u25a0 compliance with the taxation of business undertaken in the territory (including levies and sales taxes); and\n- \u25a0 cross-border tax issues.\n\nA specific focus on transfer pricing is made in application of these standards, to ensure that the pricing of our intra-group activities is consistent with the OECD 'arm's length' principle as well as with local transfer pricing rules to pay adequate tax on profits where the value is created.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn particular, Chief Financial O/ff icers must ensure that insurance and reinsurance policies entered into represent a true transfer of risk and that their status as insurance or reinsurance contracts could not be subject to challenge. Business between Group companies must be transacted at market prices where a market price exists, or in the absence of market prices, must be supported by formally documented justification for the charge made.\n\n## Products o/ff  ered by the Group\n\nAXA products are not designed to allow or encourage tax evasion. The Group has set up a validation framework to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they go to market.\n\nThe local decision to launch a new product must result from a documented approval process that complies with the AXA Group's standards in terms of product features, pricing, assetliability management and aspects related to legal, compliance, regulatory, accounting and reputation.\n\nMoreover, AXA has established strict policies regarding its cross-border activities and knowledge of its customers, in order to ensure that our products and services are not misused for money laundering or tax evasion purposes and are governed by specific rules according to which cross-border Life insurance proposals must be presented to the Group Tax and Compliance Departments for validation.\n\nWhile all Group entities must in any case comply with local regulations, the Group Tax Department can veto a product if this product is not compliant with internal rules.\n\nPursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/822, AXA may, as a provider of investments and savings products, have tax reporting obligations with respect to certain cross-border products it designs or implements. In particular, certain investments and savings products with no particular tax motive may be reportable under the above-mentioned Directive.",

On May 26, 1977, the Shareholders' Meeting decided that each ordinary share fully paid up and held in registered form by the same person for at least two full fiscal years entitled its holder to double voting rights with respect to such share.\n\nIn the event of a capital increase by capitalization of existing reserves, profits or premiums, shares granted for free to any shareholder holding shares entitled to double voting rights will also carry double voting rights.\n\nThe rights of the holders of double voting rights may only be modified or cancelled upon the decision of an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting and after authorization by a special meeting of the holders of these rights.\n\nWith the exception of double voting rights, there is currently only one class of shares with equal rights for all shareholders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nUpon proposal by the Board of Directors of AXA SA, the shareholders of AXA SA may decide to allocate all or part of distributable profits to special or general reserves, to carry them forward to the next fiscal year as retained earnings, or to allocate them to the shareholders as dividends. If AXA SA has earned a distributable profit since the end of the previous fiscal year, as reflected in an interim balance sheet certified by its Statutory Auditors, the Board of Directors may distribute interim dividends to the extent of the distributable profit without prior approval of the shareholders. AXA SA's Bylaws require AXA SA to distribute any dividends between its shareholders in proportion to their share in the capital.\n\nUnder the provisions of AXA SA's Bylaws, the actual dividend payment date is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nAXA SA's Bylaws provide that the Shareholders' Meeting may grant each shareholder the choice to receive dividends in either cash or additional ordinary shares.\n\n## Pre-emptive rights\n\nUnder French law, shareholders have preferential subscription rights to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, additional ordinary shares (and/or convertible, exchangeable or other securities\n\nI\n\nI\n\ngiving a claim, directly or indirectly, to AXA SA ordinary shares). This subscription right is transferable and normally trades separately during the subscription period for a capital increase. Issuing additional shares without preferential subscription rights requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Liquidation rights\n\nIf AXA SA is liquidated, the assets remaining after it pays its debts, liquidation expenses and all prior claims will be used to repay AXA SA's shareholders up to the amount of the liquidation balance and the par value of the shares held by each shareholder. Any surplus will be divided among all shareholders, subject to rights arising, if any, from di/ff  erent classes of shares, in proportion to the rights they own in the Company's share capital.\n\n## MODIFICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS\n\nUnder French law, shareholders of a French public company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) have the power to amend AXA SA's Bylaws. Such an amendment generally requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting. However, no such Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings may decide (i) to increase the liability of the shareholders in respect of the Company or a third party; or (ii) to reduce the individual rights vested in each shareholder (such as voting rights, right to distributable profits of the Company, right to sell one's shares and right to sue the Company).\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS\n\nShareholders are convened, meet and deliberate in accordance with applicable French laws and AXA SA's Bylaws.\n\nA notice of meeting must be published in the Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires ('BALO'), at least 35 days before any Shareholders' Meeting (or 15 days in certain specific cases), and must indicate, in particular, the agenda and the proposed resolutions.\n\nAt least 15 days (or six days in certain cases) prior to the date set for the meeting on first call, and at least 10 days (or four days in certain cases) before any second call, the Company shall send a final notice containing all the information requested by law by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares for more than one month prior to the date of this final notice and publish a final notice in a bulletin of legal notices, as well as the BALO.",

        "page_content": "All shareholders are entitled to attend these meetings, either in person or by proxy, provided that they show valid proof of ID and share ownership as specified under French law. This ownership is justified by a book entry showing the number of shares in the name of the shareholder (or the intermediary for the account), on the second business day preceding the meeting at 0:00 am, Paris time (France), either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by a qualified intermediary.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of A rticle L.22.10-10 5\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, the conditions for the participation to Shareholders' Meetings are detailed in article 23 of AXA SA's Bylaws, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.\n\nIn addition, the information referred to in Article  L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code is made public in the corporate governance report approved by AXA SA's Board of Directors' and attached to the Management Report ( Rapport de gestion ) of the Board of Directors included in this Annual Report. For further information, please refer to Appendix VI  'C orporate governance report - Cross Reference Table' to this Annual Report.\n\n## ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS\n\nThere are no French anti-takeover statutes similar to the antitakeover statutes enacted by certain states in the United States and other jurisdictions. However, a number of French law provisions, in particular those resulting from Law No. 2014-384 dated March 29, 2014 ( visant \u00e0 reconqu\u00e9rir l'\u00e9conomie r\u00e9elle ), from Law No. 2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 ( relative \u00e0 la croissance et la transformation des entreprises ), known as 'PACTE', or from certain provisions of Directive 2004/25/EC dated April 21, 2004 on takeover bids (which was implemented in France in 2006), may have certain anti-takeover e/ff ects. In the case of AXA, the relevant provisions include, among other things, the existence of AXA shares with double voting rights, which are described above, and specific notification requirements applicable when holdings exceed specified thresholds, as described below.\n\nFrench law generally requires mergers and certain consolidations to be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to decide on such matters.\n\n## NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHEN HOLDINGS EXCEED SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS\n\nPursuant to article 7 of AXA SA's Bylaws, any person, acting alone or jointly, who comes to hold, directly or indirectly, through companies it controls within the meaning of article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code, a number of shares representing 0.5% of the Company's share capital or voting rights, shall notify the Company by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt within five days from the threshold crossing. This notification shall detail the total number of shares and voting rights held as well as the total number of securities giving a deferred claim to the share capital and the potential voting rights attached thereto.\n\nThe notification shall be repeated in the conditions stated above each time an additional fraction of 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed upward or downward.\n\nIn  the  event  of  failure  to  comply  with  the  notification requirements described above, shares exceeding the fraction that should have been notified will be deprived of voting rights at the Shareholders' Meetings if, at such meetings, the notification failure has been recorded and if one or more shareholders jointly holding at least 5% of the share capital so request. Loss of voting rights shall be applicable in all Shareholders' Meetings that would be held up until two years following proper notification.\n\n## CHANGES IN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's share capital may be modified only under the conditions stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions in force. The provisions of the Bylaws or the terms of reference of the Board of Directors of AXA SA shall not prevail over changes in the law governing the Company's share capital.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

AXA's Statutory Auditors provide a reasonable assurance report on AXA Group's ICOFR each year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group Internal Control Standard and the Group Internal Control Policy, which include additional specific requirements for the IFC framework.\n\n## (a) IFC framework\n\nThe IFC framework is based on the 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to define the IFC scope, governance, and principles in order to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting.\n\n## (A.1) IFC SCOPE\n\nThe IFC program includes primarily the entities which are individually significant to consolidated financial position or results of operations, as well as the entities which provide significant services to AXA and/or its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\n## (A.2) IFC GOVERNANCE\n\nManagement, including the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer (CEO), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICOFR.\n\nThe IFC program is steered by the Group IFC Committee chaired by the Group CFO and involves the Planning Budgets Results Central (PBRC) Department, other relevant AXA departments, and representatives from each in-scope entity. The IFC program and the conclusion of management as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR are also reviewed by AXA's Audit Committee.\n\n## (A.3) IFC PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA Group's ICOFR includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- \u25a0 the maintenance of records accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Group assets;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- \u25a0 the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles;\n- \u25a0 the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Group; and\n- \u25a0 unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Group assets that could have a material e/ff ect on the Group's financial statements would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to assess the e/ff ectiveness of ICOFR, financial reporting risks are initially identified at Group level with a focus on identifying those risks that may result in a material misstatement of Consolidated Financial Statements not being prevented or detected in a timely manner. This top-down and risk-based approach enables to identify in-scope entities and processes.\n\nIn line with the COSO framework, AXA Group's ICOFR is organized around the following key process categories: Entity-Level Controls (ELC), IT ELC, Financial Statement Closing Process, Business Processes, and IT General Controls.\n\nFor every key process category, the in-scope entities (i) document the significant processes and/or controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level, (ii) test the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of key controls based on the test plans elaborated with insight into risks, and (iii) remediate identified control deficiencies.\n\nOutstanding control deficiencies are consolidated at Group level to evaluate their impact on Consolidated Financial Statements, compensating controls and other qualitative factors. This evaluation process is designed to identify any control deficiencies that may rise to the level of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on time.\n\n## (A.4) IFC CERTIFICATION\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities are required to perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process. This process involves formal sign-o/ff  by the entity's process owners and culminates with a formal management report from the entity's CFO or another senior executive o/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.",

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that AXA Group's ICOFR was e/ff ective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined\n\nto be e/ff ective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ff ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.\n\n## (c) Report of the Statutory Auditors on ICOFR\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young Audit have performed audit procedures in order to be able to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether management's conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR based on the IFC framework is fairly stated.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

The assessment of the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria set out in the IFC Framework.\n\nOur independence is defined by the requirements set out in Article L. 821-28 of the Commercial Code, the Code of deontology for statutory auditors and the IESBA Code of ethics (International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)).\n\nFurthermore, we apply the International Standard on Quality Management 1 which requires that we design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur role, in response to AXA's request, is to express a reasonable assurance opinion as to whether the statement of AXA's Management on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, was prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set out in the IFC Framework.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with professional standards and ISAE 3000 (revised). These standards require that we design and perform procedures which enable us to obtain reasonable assurance that the statement of AXA's Management on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, is fairly presented in all material respects. Our work consisted in obtaining an understanding of the internal control procedures over financial reporting, assessing the risk regarding the existence of any material weakness, testing and assessing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of internal control on a risk by risk basis, and where relevant performing any other procedures that we considered necessary. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is su/ff icient and appropriate to express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nDue to the limitations inherent to internal control over financial reporting, the procedures related thereto may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, the assessment of their e/ff ectiveness in respect of any future periods, is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or in the event that the degree of compliance with the principles or procedures were to deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, Management's statement on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2023 was prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set out in the IFC framework.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 18, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nGr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nOlivier Durand\n\nPatrick Menard\n\nI\n\nErnst & Young Audit\n\nTour First, TSA 14444 92037 Paris-La D\u00e9fense",

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS\n\nSignificant changes are commented on in the tables included in this appendix.\n\n## 2. CHANGE IN METHOD AND PRESENTATION\n\nNo change in method or presentation was made during the 2023 financial year.\n\n## 3. INFORMATION ON POST-CLOSING EVENTS\n\n## AXA announced the successful placement of \u20ac1.5 billion Restricted Tier 1 Notes\n\nOn January 10, 2024, AXA announced the successful placement of \u20ac1.5 billion of Reg S perpetual deeply subordinated notes (the 'Notes') with institutional investors. The Notes qualify as Restricted Tier 1 capital under Solvency II. Investor demand for the issuance was strong with a book subscribed more than 5 times.\n\nThe initial fixed rate has been set at 6.375% per annum until the end of a 6-month call window period (ending on January 16, 2034), when the interest rate will reset and every five years therea/f\\_t er at the prevailing Euro 5-year Mid Swap rate plus a margin of 384.1 basis points. In line with the Solvency II requirements, the Notes\n\nfeature a loss absorption mechanism in the form of a write-down (1) of the nominal amount of the Notes in the event that one of the solvency-related triggers (2) is breached (3) . Interest payments are at the full discretion of AXA unless they are mandatorily prohibited.\n\nThe Notes are rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor's and Baa1(hyb) by Moody's. They will be treated as capital from a regulatory and rating agencies' perspective within applicable limits.\n\nThis issuance is part of AXA Group's funding plan for 2024 and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of part of the AXA Group's outstanding debt.\n\nThe settlement of the Notes took place on January 16, 2024.\n\n## Execution of a share repurchase agreement in relation to AXA's share buy-back program of up to \u20ac1.6 billion\n\nOn February 23, 2024, AXA has executed a share repurchase agreement with an investment services provider, whereby AXA will buy back its own shares for a maximum amount of \u20ac1.6 billion, reflecting:\n\n- \u25a0 \u20ac1.1 billion share buy-back, in line with its new capital management policy, as announced on February 22, 2024;\n- \u25a0 \u20ac0.5 billion anti-dilutive share buy-back related to the reinsurance agreement for an in-force Savings portfolio at AXA France, as announced on December 20, 2023.\n\nThe share repurchase agreement will be executed in accordance with the terms of the applicable Shareholders' Annual General Meeting authorization (4) .\n\nUnder the share repurchase agreement (5) announced on February 23, 2024, shares will be bought back commencing on February 26, 2024, and ending at the latest on August 5, 2024. On each day during the purchase period, the price per share to be paid by AXA (6) will be determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price.\n\nAXA intends to cancel all shares repurchased pursuant to this share buy-back program.\n\n- (1) With discretionary reinstatement subject to conditions as further described in the Prospectus dated January 10, 2024.\n- (2) As determined under Solvency II.\n- (3) Either at AXA Group level or at AXA SA solo level. AXA SA expects to transition the calculation of its Solo Solvency II ratio from the Solvency II standard formula to the AXA Group's Internal Model by the end of 2024, subject to prior approval by the ACPR. At AXA SA level, the impact of such transition is expected to result in a reduction in the AXA SA Solo Solvency II ratio to a level more consistent with AXA Group's Solvency II ratio. At Group level, such transition is expected to have an immaterial impact on the AXA Group's Solvency II ratio and a limited negative impact on the AXA Group's MCR coverage. The AXA SA MCR coverage is expected to remain materially above the AXA Group MCR coverage.\n- (4) The Shareholders' Annual General Meeting authorization granted on April 27, 2023, or the authorization expected to be granted by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 23, 2024, as applicable.\n- (5) The up to \u20ac1.6 billion share buy-back program will be executed in addition to any other potential anti-dilutive share buy-back including the previously announced share buy-back to be executed following the closing of the sale of a Life & Pensions portfolio by AXA Germany.\n- (6) The purchase price will not exceed the maximum purchase price approved at the applicable Shareholders' Annual General Meeting.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, RULES AND METHODS\n\n## 4.1 General principles\n\nAXA SA's 2023 annual financial statements were prepared , in accordance with the accounting provisions set out in Title IV of Book III of the French Insurance Code and the regulation of the French Accounting Standards Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC) No. 2015-11 of November 26, 2015 modified.\n\n## 4.2 Reinsurance activity within AXA SA\n\nThe Company is the AXA Group's internal reinsurer and reinsures exclusively the Group's insurance entities ('cedants'), both for Property and Casualty and Life risks.\n\nAccepted operations concern transactions whereby AXA SA, the reinsurer, agrees to assume a portion of the risks underwritten by AXA's entities.\n\nThe retrocessions correspond to the transfer of risks by AXA SA to other market players, whether internal or external to the AXA Group.\n\nAssumed reinsurance is recognized by the Company upon receipt of the accounts transmitted by the ceding company. In accordance with the provisions of article 152-1 of ANC Regulation No. 201511 of November 26, 2015, accounts not received from the ceding company at the end of the financial fiscal are estimated. When the Company becomes aware of a foreseeable loss, it is provisioned.\n\nRetroceded reinsurance premiums are recognized in proportion to the period in which the reinsurance coverage is provided.\n\nEstimates of commissions receivable or payable are recognized in the income statement with a counterpart entry in accruals assets or liabilities.\n\nWhere the treaties so provide, the Company must make deposits with the assignees so that they can have a guarantee on their ceded technical reserves.\n\n(2)\n\nI\n\nThe reinsurance premium paid by the ceding company to the reinsurer only constitutes a basic premium intended to cover the reinsurance capacity. As claims occur, the ceding company must pay an additional premium called 'reinstatement premium' which corresponds to the renewal of the portion of the capacity absorbed by the claim and up to the limit of the annual guarantee.\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Company reduces the carrying value accordingly and recognizes this impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is tangible evidence, following an event occurring a/f\\_t er the initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Company may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the treaty, and the impact of this event on the amounts to be received from retroceding companies by the Company can be reliably estimated.\n\n## 4.3 Principles of presentation of the financial statements\n\n## NON-LIFE AND LIFE INCOME STATEMENTS\n\nPursuant to article 410-1 of ANC Regulation No. 2015-11 of November 26, non-Life activities in the non-Life income statement include the reinsurance of bodily injury related to accidents and illness.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES BY TYPE\n\nThe general expenses of the reinsurance activity, a/f\\_t er having been previously recognized by type in class 9 financial statements, are cleared for allocation to expense accounts by type and in Life/ non-Life technical income statements.\n\nTwo cases are provided for:\n\n- \u25a0 either the expense can be allocated directly to a type of expense;\n- \u25a0 or the expense cannot be allocated directly, and distribution and distribution keys are used.\n\nGeneral expenses allocation keys are updated every year to reflect the categories defined by the Insurance Accounting Plan: acquisition costs, claims settlement costs, administration expenses, investment management costs and other technical expenses.\n\nExpenses relating to the holding company's activity are individualized and allocated in full and unequivocally to nontechnical expenses without the application of a distribution key.\n\n## INVESTMENT INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nNet investment income relating to the portfolio of assets covering the holding company and reinsurance operations is recorded in the non-technical income statement.\n\nAccording to the terms specified in article 337-11 of the ANC Regulation 2015-11, net investment income is allocated between technical and non-technical results, based on the relative weight of equity and technical provisions. A portion of the financial result allocated to technical provisions is transferred to the technical income statement (Life and non-Life), in proportion to the technical provisions and equity.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION TREATMENT\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article R.341-7 of the French Insurance Code, foreign currency transactions carried out by the Company are recognized in their original currency. These transactions are converted into euros at the prices known on the inventory date.\n\nThe Company applies the rules relating to the accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions of companies governed by the French Insurance Code in accordance with ANC Regulation 2015-11.\n\n## Foreign exchange balance sheet position applicable to receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, foreign currency items shown in the balance sheet must be translated into euros by breaking down transactions as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 transactions involving assets or liabilities generating a so-called structural foreign exchange position, mainly investments in subsidiaries and the financing of these in foreign currencies;\n- \u25a0 transactions generating an operational foreign exchange position concerning other transactions in foreign currencies.\n\nTranslation di/ff erences are valued as the di/ff erence between the exchange rate of the currency concerned on the day of the transaction (historical rate) and the closing rate. Translation di/ff  erences in structural foreign exchange positions are recognized in the balance sheet while translation di/ff erences in operational foreign exchange positions are recognized in foreign exchange income.\n\n## Foreign exchange o/ff -balance sheet positions applicable to Forward Financial Instruments (FFIs)\n\nDi/ff erences between the o/ff -balance sheet foreign exchange positions of Forward Financial Instruments (FFIs) and the corresponding exchange value accounts represent unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses. They are recorded on the balance sheet in a 'translation adjustments' account as opposed to the 'Accruals related to financial instruments account', according to the underlying strategy.\n\nThe treatment of the 'translation adjustments ' account aims to respect the symmetry of treatment with that of exchange di/ff erences on the underlying items:\n\n- \u25a0 when the FFIs is linked to a structural element, the 'translation adjustments' account is maintained in the balance sheet until the date on which the structural element is realized;\n- \u25a0 when the FFIs is part of an investment strategy, the 'translation adjustments' account is maintained on the balance sheet until the date of the investment;\n- \u25a0 when the FFIs is linked to an operating item, as part of a divestment or yield strategy, or when the FFIs is linked to a non-structural financial debt, the 'translation adjustments' account is recorded in income.\n\nDi/ff  erences in interest on forward foreign exchange transactions, or carry-forwards, are recognized on a staggered basis over the e/ff  ective term of the hedged transaction.\n\n## PENSION COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of the update to pension commitments, an assessment was made of the additional reserves to be established to cover\n\ncommitments under defined-benefit pension plans, in accordance with ANC Recommendation No. 2013-02. Method 1 defined by this recommendation has been applied: the cost of past services is spread out in the income statement over the vesting period of the rights, and the expected return on the assets is retained as part of the expense for the period.  The option retained by the Company is to not record any provisions in the balance sheet.\n\n## 5. PRESENTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS\n\n## BALANCE SHEET - ASSETS\n\n## 5.1 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets mainly include the AXA brand.\n\n## 5.2 Investments\n\nInvestments include land and buildings, investments in a/ff iliated companies and in companies in which there is a shareholding link, and other investments as well as receivables for cash deposited with ceding companies that are related to the reinsurance business.\n\n## LAND AND BUILDINGS\n\nThey include shares in real estate companies (SCIs).\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND IN COMPANIES WITH WHICH THERE IS A SHAREHOLDING LINK\n\n## \u25a0 A/ff iliated companies\n\nFrench or foreign companies meeting the conditions in French Commercial Code articles L.233-16 and L.233-18 to be fully consolidated in the entity to which the insurance or reinsurance company belongs, under the full consolidation method according to the same terms, except for companies that are not insurance or reinsurance companies and which may not be consolidated pursuant to French Commercial Code article L.233-19 1 \u00b0 or 2 \u00b0 of II.\n\n## \u25a0 Companies with which the reinsurance undertaking has a participating interest\n\nUndertakings other than related parties in which the insurance company directly or indirectly holds a stake within the meaning of article 20 of the Decree of November 29, 1983, or which directly or indirectly hold such a stake in the insurance company; in accordance with this article and with French Commercial Code article L.233-2, equity stakes of at least 10% of the share capital is presumed to be participating interests.\n\nIn the context of the holding company, participating interests are defined as shareholdings representing at least 10% of the issuing company's share capital and those whose long-term ownership is deemed useful to the Company.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at acquisition cost or transfer cost. At the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, and the lower of these two values is then recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

Estimating value in use of these securities requires the management judgement in choosing valuation approaches, depending on the investments involved, and in determining the data and assumptions used to estimate expected earnings when these are considered into the valuation. For the Life business, the methods used to estimate value in use changed following the first-time application of IFRS 17. Value in use is now determined on the basis of shareholders'equity according to IFRS, to which the value of future profits estimated on the basis of the margins on contractual services determined according to IFRS 17, and the profitability of future contracts estimated on the basis of multiples of the present value of expected profits on contracts underwritten during one year, are added.\n\nFor Property and Casualty business the value in use approach relies on the earnings of the strategic plan approved by management discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value.\n\nPursuant to article 242-2 of Regulation ANC No. 2015-11, transactions involving structural investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies are considered as transactions in euros and are frozen in euros at the historical exchange rate, and no translation di/ff erences are recognized subsequently.\n\n## OTHER INVESTMENTS\n\n## Bonds and other fixed-income securities\n\nBonds and other fixed-income securities are recorded at the acquisition value, excluding accrued interest. The di/ff erence between the purchase price and the redemption value, premium or discount, is amortized in income over the remaining period until the redemption date, according to the e/ff ective interest rate method, pursuant to the provisions of article 122-1 of ANC Regulation No. 2015-11 of November 26, 2015.\n\nUnrealized losses arising from the di/ff erence between the carrying value (considering the premium/discount) and the realizable value of the corresponding securities are not subject to a reserve. Nevertheless, when there is a reason to consider that the debtor will not be able to meet its commitments, either for the payment of interest or for the repayment of the principal, an impairment must be recognized in the inventory.\n\n## Shares and other variable-income securities\n\nShares and other variable-income securities are recorded at their acquisition cost, excluding fees. The realized value at the end of the fiscal year is determined in accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2015-11 of November 26, 2015 and corresponds, for listed securities, to the stock market price on the day of the inventory and, for unlisted securities, at the market value determined on the basis of the net position.\n\nWhen the realizable value is more than 20% lower than the acquisition cost for more than six consecutive months, it is proceeded by an analysis of the permanent nature of the impairment.

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the matter\n\nAt December 31, 2023, investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists represented \u20ac66 745 million, a significant balance sheet item.\n\nThese investments are initially carried at acquisition cost or their contribution value. At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment allowance is recognized if the value at closing date is less than the acquisition cost.\n\nAs described in note 5.2 to the financial statements, the value at closing date corresponds to the value in use and is determined by management on the basis of the share price, the equity value (including unrealized gains), or the future prospects of the subsidiary.\n\nEstimating the value in use of these types of investments requires a significant degree of judgment from management in terms of selecting the measurement methods, depending on the investment in question, and in determining which data and assumptions should be used to estimate the expected profits when these are taken into account in the valuation.\n\n## In  particular:\n\n- \u25a0 For the 'Life' activities, the estimation method of the value in use has evolved since the first-time application of IFRS 17. The value in use is now determined based on equity according to the IFRS framework, to which the value of future profits is added. It is estimated based on the the residual contractual service margin services determined according to the IFRS 17 standard, and the profitability of future contracts estimated based on multiples of the present value of expected profits on contracts underwritten during a year;\n- \u25a0 For 'Property and Casualty' activities, the estimation method of the value results from cash-flow projections based on the strategic plan approved by management, discounted using a risks adjusted rate. Beyond the strategic plan horizon, future cash-flows are extrapolated using long term growth rates deemed achievable, to derive a terminal value.\n- \u25a0 Given the inherent uncertainty involved in the use of forecasts (in terms of whether or not they will be achieved) and in the judgment required to assess value in use, we deemed the correct measurement of investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists, particularly those based on forward-looking data, to be a key audit matter.\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of the estimated value in use of investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists, based on the information provided to us, our audit work consisted primarily of controlling that the estimated values determined by management were based on an appropriate measurement method and assumptions, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nFor the 'Life' activities, we have:\n\n- \u25a0 Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology retained by Management\n- \u25a0 Checked the consistency of the data on the equity, the residual contractual service margin and the profitability of future contracts used for the value in use and the one of the audited consolidated financial statements.\n- \u25a0 Verified the accuracy of the value in use calculated;\n- \u25a0 For the other 'Property and Casualty' activities notably, we have, on a sample of securities and on the basis of the projections for cash flow and operating cash flow for the businesses produced by the operational management teams:\n- -Checked the consistency of the historical data used with the financial statements of the audited entities;\n- -Checked that the assumptions are consistent with the economic environment at the closing date and at the date the financial statements were prepared;\n- -Compared projections made in previous periods with actual results in order to assess the reliability of the estimates;\n- -Verified the accuracy of the value in use calculated;\n- -Checked that the value in use, which is based on projected cash flows, has been adjusted to account for debts.\n\nWe also exmined the recording of other non technical reserves where the company is exposed to the losses of a subsidiary with negative equity.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 et R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## easurement of Investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists\n\n(See Notes 5.2 to the financial statements)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

They are established on the basis of data provided by the ceding compagnies and supplemented by actuarial estimates based on historical statistics and indications provided by underwriters. These estimates, based on reinsurance commitments or on statistical and actuarial bases, involve significant uncertainties and require a significant degree of judgment from management.\n\nIn this context, we considered the measurement of claims reserves for reinsurance contracts to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn order to cover the risk relating to the measurement of claim reserves, we have implemented the following audit approach with our actuarial specialists:\n\n- \u25a0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by AXA SA with current accounting standards and its application;\n- \u25a0 We evaluated and tested the design and operating e/ff ectiveness of the internal controls we deemed key to our audit and related to:\n- -the management of claims and, in particular, the measurement of reserves on a case-by-case basis;\n- -the calculation of the ultimate cost (assumptions, judgments, data, methodologies, compliance with the applicable accounting principles and methods), including second opinion supplied by Risk Management with respect to technical reserves;\n- -the IT systems used to process the technical data and integration into the accounting system.\n\nFor the treaties with mutualized risks on which AXA SA establishes its own estimate:\n\n- \u25a0 Our work also consisted in assessing the statistical methods and actuarial inputs applied, as well as of the assumptions used, with respect to the applicable regulations, and the economic and financial context of AXA SA;\n- \u25a0 We tested the reliability of the data used as the basis for the estimates;\n- \u25a0 We have, undertook an independent evaluation of these reserves for some insurance risk categories.\n- \u25a0 We have, notably on branches of activity where the estimation of claims provisions has a higher risk of uncertainty and judgment, evaluated the outcome of the accounting estimates made the previous years with a view to assessing the reliability of the process used by management to calculate these estimates;\n\nFor the other treaties we have, verified an a sample basis, the reciprocity of the data recorded in the annual accounts of AXA SA with those of the ceding subsidiaries.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFIC  VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by law and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders with the exception of the point below:\n\nConcerning the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information on supplier payment terms referred to in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following matter to report: as explained in the management report, the information does not include reinsurance transactions because the Company considers that they do not fall within the scope of the disclosure requirement in accordance with the circular issued by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de l'Assurance dated 29 May 2017.\n\nI\n\nI",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ff airs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25a0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff ectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u25a0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 \u00e0 L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors (code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March 18 , 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon\n\nGr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nOlivier Durand\n\nPatrick Menard\n\nI\n\nI",

AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing gross debt (financing debt, as disclosed in Section 6.6 - Note 15 'Financing debt', and undated and deeply subordinated debts, as disclosed in Section 6.6 - Note 11 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' in this Annual Report) by total capital employed (shareholders' equity excluding undated and deeply subordinated debts), gross debt and Contractual Service Margin (net of tax), as it represents the unearned profit to be recognized as services are provided to policyholders.\n\n## OTHER DEFINITIONS\n\n## Asset Management - Net inflows\n\nNet inflows represent inflows of client money less outflows of client money. Net inflows are used by the Management to measure the impact of sales e/ff orts, product attractiveness (mainly dependent on performance and innovation), and the general market trend in investment allocation.\n\n## Asset Management - Cost Income ratio\n\nUnderlying cost income ratio is the ratio of general expenses excluding distribution-related expenses to gross revenues excluding distribution fees received.\n\n## Assets under Management ('AuM')\n\nAssets under Management are defined as the assets the management of which has been delegated by their owner to an asset management company such as AXA Investment Managers. AuM only include funds and mandates which generate fees and exclude double counting.\n\n## Average Assets Under Management ('Average AuM')\n\nAverage Assets under Management represent an annual measure of the assets during the period, taking into account net flows, market e/ff ect and foreign exchange to compute the year-to-date average. They also exclude assets held in joint venture companies which are consolidated under the equity method.",

EOF is defined as the excess of market value of assets over best estimate liabilities and risk margin as per Solvency II regulation.\n\n## Financial Result\n\nFinancial Result consists of investment income on assets backing Building Block Approach ('BBA') and Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA') contracts as well as assets backing shareholder's equity, net of the Insurance finance expenses ('IFE') defined as the unwind of the present value of future cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross Written Premiums and Other Revenues\n\nGross Written Premiums represent the insurance premiums collected during the period (including risk premiums, premiums from pure investment contracts with no discretionary participating features, fees and revenues, net of commissions paid on assumed reinsurance business). Other Revenues represent premiums and fees collected on activities other than insurance ( i.e. , banking, services and Asset Management activities).\n\n## Long-Term Business\n\nLong-Term Business refers to insurance activities measured using the Variable Fee Approach ('VFA') or the Building Block Approach ('BBA'), as well as Protection with Savings, even if the latter is measured using Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA'). Long-Term Business margin analysis includes CSM Release and Technical Experience.\n\n## New Business Value ('NBV')\n\nNBV represents the value of newly issued contracts during the current year. It consists of the sum of (i) the New Business Contractual Service Margin, (ii) the present value of the future profits of Short-Term Business newly issued contracts during the period, carried by Life entities, considering expected renewals, and (iii) the present value of the future profits of pure investment contracts accounted for under IFRS 9, net of (iv) the cost of reinsurance, (v) taxes and (vi) minority interests.\n\n## NBV Margin\n\nNBV Margin is the ratio of (i) New Business Value representing the value of newly issued contracts during the current year to (ii) Present Value of Expected Premiums (PVEP).\n\n## New Business Contractual Service Margin ( 'NB  CSM')\n\nNB CSM represents a component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for newly issued insurance contracts during the period, representing the unearned profit to be recognized as insurance contract services are provided.\n\n## Present Value of Expected Premium ('PVEP')\n\nPVEP represents the new business volume, equal to the present value at the time of issue of the total premiums expected to be received over the policy term. PVEP is discounted at the reference interest rate and PVEP is Group share.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

Short-Term Business margin is analyzed using the Combined Ratio. Short-Term Business covers Property & Casualty, Health and Life Pure Protection when measured using the PAA. Bank and Asset Management activities are presented in the aggregate 'Financial Results and Other' in the Group Earnings table.\n\n## S olvency II  ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as per Solvency II and is equal to the total amount of the Group's Eligible Own Funds ('EOF') divided by the Group's Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'). The Solvency Capital Requirement, i.e. , the denominator of the Solvency II ratio, is set at a level to ensure that insurers and reinsurers are able to meet their obligations towards policyholders and beneficiaries over the next 12 months, with a 99.5% probability. The Solvency Capital Requirement can be calculated either based on the standard formula or an internal model.\n\nThe Solvency II ratio is estimated primarily using AXA's internal model calibrated based on an adverse 1/200-year shock. For further information on AXA's internal model and Solvency II disclosures, please refer to AXA Group's Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) as of December 31, 2022, available on AXA's website ( www.axa.com ).\n\nI\n\n## Technical Experience\n\nTechnical Experience consists of the impacts on the underlying earnings of (i) the di/ff  erence between the expected and incurred cash flows of the defined period, (ii) the risk adjustment release, (iii) the changes in onerous contracts and (iv) the other longterm elements which are mainly composed of non-attributable expenses.\n\n## Underlying Return on in-force\n\nUnderlying Return on in-force represents the release of the time value of options and guarantees plus the unwind of CSM at the reference rate plus the underlying financial over-performance.",
