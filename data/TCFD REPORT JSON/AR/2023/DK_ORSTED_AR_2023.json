To meet these requirements, a set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) have been adopted by the EU.\n\nIn 2023, we decided to develop the 'Sustainability statements', a new section in our annual report for 2023. The sustainability statements have been prepared with reference to the ESRS. In 2023, our aim was to adapt as much as possible of the fundamental structure of the standards and to integrate it with the other parts of the annual report in the best way possible. We have done this by using the 'Incorporation by reference' option.\n\nAs a result of the new section, we will no longer publish separate ESG performance or sustainability reports.\n\nFurthermore, our statutory corporate governance report has been incorporated into the governance section of the annual report.\n\nGet an overview of all of our reporting material by downloading our reports and investor presentations.\n\nIn our remuneration report, you will get a transparent and comprehensive overview of the remuneration of our Executive Board and our Board of Directors.\n\nIn our green bond impact report, you will get an insight into our green bond portfolio and the sustainability impact from our projects financed with green bonds. Outstanding green bonds and green hybrid bonds currently account for more than 88 % of \u00d8rsted's total portfolio of bonds and hybrid capital.\n\n- \u2192  See our reports at orsted.com\n\n## The cover photo is from our offshore wind farm Hornsea 2 in the North Sea\n\nHornsea 2 is operated and maintained from our East Coast Hub in Grimsby, the UK, which supports a workforce of over 600 people.\n\nThe wind farm spans an area of 462 square kilometres (178 square miles) and powers over 1.4 million UK homes with renewable energy.\n\n- \u2192  See more at orsted.com",

In the autumn of 2023, we took the tough but necessary decision to cease development of our Ocean Wind 1 offshore wind project in the US in the form it was awarded by the New Jersey Board of Public  Utilities.\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ocean Wind 1 had been faced with a variety of challenges, such as higher costs of capital (US risk-free rate increasing by approx. 300 bps from the award in 2019), cost inflation, supply chain challenges, and slow permitting. As explained in our interim financial report for the first nine months of 2023, the decision to cease the development was taken after additional supplier delays further impacted the project schedule, which led to an additional significant delay to the project.\n\nIn addition, we had updated our view on certain assumptions, including tax credit monetisation and\n\nthe timing and likelihood of final construction permits. Finally, continued increases to long-dated US interest rates had further deteriorated the business case.\n\nIn addition to the impairments we recognised in the third quarter on Ocean Wind 1 and other of our US projects, the decision to cease development of Ocean Wind 1 resulted in significant costs for terminating contracts, driven by high commitments prior to reaching final investment decision (FID).\n\nWe have reviewed our Ocean Wind 1 project and are implementing the learnings into our operating model to reduce risks in the development and execution of projects, with a particular focus on monitoring of and updates on project execution, including risk reviews with the Group Executive Team and the Board of Directors, structured external reviews for select projects, internal peer assessments, contingency planning, and monitoring of suppliers. Furthermore, we will prioritise inflation protection in offtake arrangements in future projects.\n\n\u2191  Mads Nipper and Thomas Thune Andersen.",

        "page_content": "In the UK, we reached a significant milestone when our offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 reached FID\ufffd With a capacity of 2\ufffd9 GW, it will be the world's single largest offshore wind farm\ufffd\n\nWe will continue our work to manage future breakaway profiles by scrutinising financial commitments before taking final investment decision (FID) to avoid high capital commitments relative to project maturity and by ensuring greater flexibility on project timelines and commissioning dates as well as phasing of CAPEX. We will use the breadth of our execution portfolio and our deep, industry-leading capabilities to ensure greater resilience to external shocks or supply chain weaknesses across the portfolio.\n\nOur fundamental strategic choices on technologies and regions are unchanged. We aim to be the world leader in Offshore and a regional player in Onshore and P2X in Europe and the US. However, we have revisited our portfolio to prioritise growth options with the highest potential for value creation. In the US, our offshore wind portfolio will primarily be focused towards the North-East Atlantic, and to reduce development costs, we are exiting several offshore markets (e.g. Norway, Spain, and Portugal), deprioritising development\n\nactivities in Japan, and plan for a leaner development within floating offshore wind and P2X.As a result of this, we have updated our ambition for installed renewable capacity to 35-38 GW by 2030, which is more than a doubling of our current installed capacity. By 2026, we expect to have an installed capacity of 23 GW.\n\nFor Offshore, the 2026 contribution will be based on projects already under construction or awarded (assuming rebid award to Sunrise Wind), whereas the Onshore contribution will come from a mix of projects under construction and in our pipeline.\n\nWe will go beyond decarbonising energy systems and proactively enhance nature through biodiversity initiatives to deliver a sustainable build-out, which is net-positive to society. We are confident we can deliver on this commitment as our underlying business of operating assets remains strong as reflected in our underlying financial performance, which was above our initial guidance.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nThe costs related to terminating our Ocean Wind 1 project as well as lower forward power prices, further supply chain delays and costs to mitigate this, increasing capital expenditures (per MW) and OPEX due to cost inflation and supply chain bottlenecks have negatively impacted our credit metric (FFO/adjusted net debt) projections in 2023. Therefore, we have taken and will continue to take measures to ensure a robust balance sheet, supporting long-term growth and capital structure resilience towards 2030.\n\nBesides reducing our growth ambition, and thereby reducing capital expenditures and project development costs, we have decided to pause dividends for the financial years 2023-2025 and will accelerate our divestment programme. In addition, we have set a target to reduce our fixed costs by DKK 1 billion by 2026 compared to 2023, on a like-for-like basis, by simplifying our organisation and increasing our efficiency.\n\nWe have updated our financial targets to reflect our new strategic ambition for installed capacity by 2030. We maintain our targeted value creation of 150-300 bps spread to WACC when we bid in tenders or take FIDs. Based on the GW ambition and value creation target, we expect our EBITDA to increase to approx. DKK 39-43 billion in 2030, corresponding to an annual growth (CAGR) of 8 %. Additionally, we expect to achieve a return on capital employed (ROCE) of 14 % on average towards 2030.\n\nIn 2026, we expect EBITDA to reach approx. DKK 30-34 billion. To enable our build-out, we have a DKK 270 billion investment programme towards 2030, of which we expect to use approx. DKK 130 billion by 2026.\n\nTo support this programme, we expect farm-downs and divestments to contribute with proceeds of approx. DKK 115 billion towards 2030, of which DKK 70-80 billion is expected in 2024-2026.\n\nIn 2023, we recycled capital of DKK 8 billion by divesting the remaining 25 % of the offshore wind farm London Array to funds managed by Schroders Greencoat and farming down 50 % of Gode Wind 3 in Germany to funds managed by Glennmont Partners from Nuveen. We have identified a portfolio of assets, which we aim to farm down or divest in 2024 and the coming years. As of now, we have selected Cathay Life Insurance as preferred bidder for the acquisition of a 50 % ownership stake in Greater Changhua 4.\n\n## Strategic and operational progress remains strong\n\nWhile our current situation has required adjustments to our growth trajectory, our traction and underlying momentum remained strong in 2023. Our large portfolio of renewable assets continued to grow within both Offshore and Onshore with several projects reaching COD and FID. Our renewable share of heat and power generation amounted to 93 %. In 2023, we advanced three large offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 4.5 GW to FID, one in the UK, the US, and APAC, respectively.\n\nIn the UK, we reached a significant milestone when our offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 reached FID. With a capacity of 2.9 GW, it will be the world's single largest offshore wind farm. Hornsea 3 will provide low-cost renewable energy for the UK and deliver thousands of high-quality jobs and billions of pounds of investment in the UK's offshore wind supply chain. Additionally, we received development consent for Hornsea 4",

The possible future addition would create an offshore wind cluster in excess of 7 GW.\n\nIn APAC, another important achievement was reached with the FID of our 0.9 GW offshore wind farms Greater Changhua 2b and 4. We expect completion of the wind farms by the end of 2025. Additionally, we are finalising Greater Changhua 1 and 2a, which are Taiwan's first large-scale offshore wind farms. The last four of the 111 turbines will be installed in the spring of 2024 with subsequent COD in Q2 2024. With a total capacity of more than 1.8 GW, these wind farms represent a significant contribution to Taiwan's transition to new energy sources and its decarbonisation journey.\n\nThe US is still an important region for us, and in November, we took FID on our offshore wind farm Revolution Wind, which we own in a 50/50 partnership with Eversource. The 0.7 GW wind farm has an attractive forward-looking value creation and will power more than 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. At South Fork in New York, we are in the final stages of constructing what will be New York's first offshore wind farm. We expect COD in Q1 2024.\n\nIn January 2024, we signed an agreement with Eversource to acquire their 50 % share of Sunrise Wind. The acquisition is subject to the successful award of Sunrise Wind in the ongoing New York 4 solicitation for offshore wind capacity, signing of an OREC contract with New York's energy agency, NYSERDA, entry into\n\nlong-form acquisition agreements, receipt of construction and operations plan (COP) approval, and relevant regulatory approvals. If the project is not successful in the solicitation, the existing OREC contract for Sunrise Wind will be cancelled per the state's requirements, and our 50/50 joint venture with Eversource will remain in place. In that scenario, the joint venture will evaluate its next steps.\n\nIn Germany, our offshore wind farms Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 are progressing according to plan with CODs in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The wind farms will have a total capacity of 1.2 GW once completed.\n\nWe continue to explore new value-creating opportunities for offshore wind. In Ireland, we entered into a partnership with ESB, the leading utility company in the country, to jointly develop an Irish offshore wind portfolio.\n\nFurthermore, we were granted a 1.6 GW electricity business license (EBL) by the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy for an offshore wind project located 70 km off the coast of Incheon City.\n\nOur Onshore business continues to grow. In 2023, four projects with a total capacity of 0.6 GW reached COD, and we added several new assets to our portfolio.\n\nIn the US, we completed the onshore wind farm Sunflower Wind in Kansas, and in Arizona, we began the construction of Eleven Mile Solar Center, a solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) with\n\n## Selected events\n\n## March\n\n## 920 MW\n\nFID on offshore wind farms Greater Changhua 2b and 4 (920 MW), Taiwan.

        "page_content": "expected completion in 2024. In Texas, the construction of our 471 MW AC Mockingbird Solar Center is going as plan-ned, with COD expected in the second half of 2024.\n\nWe continue to develop our European onshore renewables portfolio. In the UK, we entered our first solar project in 2023, One Earth Solar Farm, a 740 MW AC solar project with associated battery storage. If built, it will be one of the largest solar farms in the country. Additionally, we took FID on phase one of Garreenleen, our first solar project in Ireland, and in January 2024, the onshore wind farm Farranrory in Tipperary reached FID. We secured contracts for both projects in the Irish Government's third onshore auction. Lastly, we entered a partnership with renewable energy developer Terra Solar to develop a portfolio of Irish solar projects with a capacity of up to 400 MW AC .\n\nIn our P2X business, the construction of our FlagshipOne project has started. It is the largest e-methanol project under construction in Europe, and we expect it to start production in 2025. To support this innovative project, Breakthrough Energy Catalyst will acquire a 15 % equity interest in FlagshipONE and provide a grant, subject to the fulfilment of funding conditions. In addition, FlagshipONE is also expected to receive a grant from Horizon Europe and a quasi-equity investment from EIB through InvestEU.\n\nIn December, we embarked on the construction of the two carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities in our project \u00d8rsted Kalundborg CO 2 Hub, which has been awarded a 20-year contract by the Danish Energy\n\nAgency (DEA). During 2025, the Asn\u00e6s and Aved\u00f8re combined heat and power plants will begin to capture and store biogenic carbon.\n\n## Financial results\n\nEBITDA totalled DKK 18.7 billion in 2023 compared to DKK 32.1 billion in 2022. EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees amounted to DKK 24.0 billion, an increase of DKK 3.0 billion compared to 2022 and above our guidance of DKK 20-23 billion. Earnings in 2023 were impacted by a provision of DKK 9.6 billion for cancellation fees related to ceasing the development of the Ocean Wind 1 project. EBITDA from new partnerships in 2023 contributed with DKK 4.3 billion and was related to the divestment of London Array and the 50 % farm-down of Gode Wind 3.\n\nEarnings from sites in operation in Offshore more than doubled to DKK 20.2 billion in 2023 due to ramp-up of generation at Greater Changhua 1 and 2a and Hornsea 2, and as the negative effects from hedges in 2022 were not repeated in 2023. Earnings from Onshore decreased due to lower-than-expected power prices and wind speeds and availability issues at some of our assets in the US.\n\nSimilarly, earnings in Bioenergy & Other decreased due to lower power prices and lower optimisation opportunities related to gas storages and sourcing contracts.\n\nIn 2023, we recognised impairments of DKK 26.8 billion, with the majority (DKK 19.9 billion) relating to Ocean Wind 1.",

        "page_content": "We have learned from this year's challenges, and we are adapting our operating model to further strengthen our ability to shape and lead our industry\ufffd\n\nROCE was -14.2 % for the year. Adjusted for impairments and cancellation fees, ROCE amounted to 12.9 % in 2023. Profit for the year amounted to DKK -20.2 billion. Excluding impairments (after tax) and cancellation fees, profit for the year was DKK 14.9 billion.\n\n## Employees and safety\n\nWe value our employees at \u00d8rsted, and we are pleased that our employee satisfaction measured in our annual employee survey showed 76 in 2023, which is at level with last year and within the top 25 % percentile of our external benchmark.\n\nEqually important is our strong safety culture, which is anchored in our organisation. In 2023, we further reduced our total recordable injury rate (TRIR) to 2.8, down from 3.1 last year. We are very pleased with this development and will continue to focus on reducing it even further.\n\nAs part of our ambition to reduce our fixed costs and increase our efficiency, we will be reducing a number of positions in the organisation and unfortunately also see\n\nredundancies. We are committed to carrying through these redundancies in a fair and respectful manner. Maintaining and improving the motivation and wellbeing of our remaining employees remain a key priority to us.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe year 2023 turned out to be a challenging year for the renewable industry in general and for \u00d8rsted in particular. And while the pressures on the renewable industry continue, we have seen positive initiatives from politicians and governments to support a sustainable and viable build-out of the industry. In Europe, the Net-Zero Industry Act proposed by the European Commission and the shared Action Agenda agreed by the North Sea countries and the European Commission are signs of this and supplement the US Inflation Reduction Act from 2022. However, the pace with which it is moving forward needs to be accelerated.\n\nIn the offshore industry, awarded prices must reflect the higher cost and interest levels across markets.\n\nRecently, the UK government significantly increased the maximum CfD level for the upcoming auction in 2024, and in New York, we saw higher PPA prices in the state's third offshore wind solicitation round. These are positive signs for the industry. Focusing solely on concession payments as key decision criteria in auctions risks putting additional pressure on the supply chain and leaves limited room for investing in scaling manufacturing capacity.\n\nFor offshore wind, regaining momentum is crucial to realise the strong value proposition it offers for societies and its key role in the renewable energy transition. We continue to engage stakeholders and partners to jointly overcome challenges to create a renewable, secure, and affordable energy system.\n\nWe are dedicated to restoring our capital structure, and we will work disciplined towards our long-term growth ambition for 2030 through prioritised growth options with the highest potential for value creation.\n\nWe have learned from this year's challenges, and we are adapting our operating model to further strengthen our ability to shape and lead our industry.\n\nWe remain optimistic about the future of the renewable energy industry. The global ambitions for renewable energy have never been higher. Most recently, we saw this at COP28 where more than 130 governments agreed to work together to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nWe are confident we can be a key contributor in accelerating the renewable build-out in the years to come.\n\nMads Nipper Group President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chair of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Bioenergy & Other - significantly higher\n\nEarnings from CHP plants (including ancillary services) and 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' are expected to increase compared to 2023.\n\nThe positive impact on EBITDA in 2024 is driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 earnings from our CHP plants, which are expected to increase as 2023 were negatively impacted by the high costs of biomass and coal relative to the market price of power. This was partly offset by lower prices and market spreads in 2024\n- \u00b7 earnings from our offshore oil and gas pipelines in 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure', which are expected to increase due to the anticipated re-opening of the Tyra gas field (not owned by \u00d8rsted) in April.\n\n## Gross investments\n\nGross investments for 2024 are expected to amount to DKK 48-52 billion, mainly driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Offshore (Greater Changhua 2b and 4, Revolution Wind, Sunrise Wind, South Fork, Hornsea 3, Borkum Riffgrund 3, Gode Wind 3, and Baltica 2)\n- \u00b7 Onshore (Mockingbird, Eleven Mile, and projects from our substantiated pipeline in both the US and Europe).\n\nOur gross investments guidance for 2024 assumes that we acquire full ownership of Sunrise Wind in H1 2024.\n\n## Uncertainties, prices, and hedges\n\nThe most significant uncertainty to the operating profit in 2024 is the power generation, which depends on wind conditions, ramp-up of new wind and solar assets, asset availability, timing of possible farm-downs, and the attractiveness of spreads on our CHP plants.\n\nOur wind and solar PV assets are largely subject to prices that are indexed to inflation or are fixed nominal, implying a high degree of revenue certainty, setting aside the above-mentioned volume risk. This means that we know the price (or minimum price) per generated MWh for most wind farms in Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Germany and for the CfD wind farms in the UK. For our British ROC wind farms, we also know the subsidy per generated MWh, which we will receive in addition to the market price.\n\nIn 2024, 81 % of our expected revenue from our wind and solar PV assets will be inflation-indexed or fixed nominal. The remaining 19 % will be exposed to fluctuations in power prices. Our hedging approach is to hedge up to 70 % of this remaining merchant exposure. For 2024, we have hedged approx. 60 % of this, leaving \u00d8rsted with an unhedged price exposure of 8 % from generation from our wind and solar PV assets. See note 6.2 'Energy price risks'.\n\nHigh gas and power price volatility could impact earnings for the year through optimisation possibilities of our gas storage and sourcing contracts as well as higher balancing and intermittency costs. In addition, a delay in the reopening of the Tyra gas field could adversely impact earnings from our gas activities.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions intensity for scope 1 and 2 is expected to decrease in 2024 due to higher renewable generation, and as we expect to cease coal-based power generation in August. However, as all scope 3 emissions from renewable assets are included from COD, we expect the scope 1-3 emissions to increase as more of our renewable assets reach COD in 2024.\n\nDue to the anticipated reopening of the Tyra gas field in April, we expect more gas delivered under our contract with The Danish Underground Consortium (DUC). Therefore, we expect an increase in our scope 3 emissions from natural gas sales.\n\n## \u00a7  Forward-looking statements\n\nThe annual report contains forward-looking statements, which include projections of our short- and long-term financial performance and targets as well as our financial policies.\n\nThese statements are by nature uncertain and associated with risk. Many factors may cause the actual development to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, changes in temperature, wind conditions, wake and blockage effects, precipitation levels, the development in power, coal, carbon, gas, oil, currency, inflation rates, and interest rate markets, the ability to uphold hedge accounting, changes in legislation, regulations, or standards, the renegotiation of contracts, changes in the competitive environment in our markets, reliability of supply, and market volatility and disruptions from geopolitical tensions.\n\nRead more about the risks in the chapter on 'Risks and risk management' and in note 6 'Risk management' in the financial statements.\n\nFurthermore, the proceeds we can realise from our anticipated farm-downs and divestments as part of the measures we take to support a robust capital structure are subject to uncertainty.",

This shift is supported by increasingly larger renewable energy projects and a significant scale-up of transmission infrastructure connecting several markets.\n\nAt the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai, more than 130 governments, including the European Union, agreed to work together to triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nTowards 2030, we are anticipating exponential growth in the renewable energy market, with total combined capacity (offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, and energy storage) reaching more than 4,200 GW, excluding China (BNEF).\n\nOffshore wind is expected to increase by a combined average growth rate (CAGR) of 21 %. In 2024, we are anticipating up to 40 GW of offshore wind capacity to be auctioned. Forecasts for onshore renewables (wind, solar PV, and energy storage) indicate a CAGR of approx. 12 %, and global targets to meet forecasted demand for P2X now exceed 260 GW of installed electrolyser capacity by 2030. However, reaching the 2030 ambition will require significant acceleration by the industry and governments through a doubling of the current rate of investment, scaling up through a mix of technologies, and addressing current barriers within the industry.\n\nAcross the renewables market, we are seeing positive signs of these ambitions, such as rising political momentum, increased support for offtake agreements, new sources of demand, and improved system integration and flexibility management.\n\nIn September, the European Union updated its Renewable Energy Directive to reach 42.5 % renewable energy consumption by 2030, requiring a massive increase in installed renewable capacity. Following this, the European Commission presented a European Wind Power Action Plan in 2023 to help maintain a healthy and competitive wind energy supply chain. Additionally, the European Commission proposed a Net-Zero Industry Act to strengthen the European manufacturing capacity of net-zero technologies and overcome barriers to scaling up the capacity. Some initiatives are already on the table, which will provide significant opportunities for the renewable energy sector. However, to reach the ambition, the pace in which it is being moved forward needs to be accelerated.\n\nIn November, the North Sea countries and the European Commission agreed on a shared Action Agenda to coordinate offshore auctions in the North Sea to increase the predictability of demand in the wind power supply chain, which will help facilitate investment in new capacity.\n\nIn the UK, the government has further enhanced its commitment to the British Energy Security Strategy established in 2022 by announcing its 2023 Energy\n\nSecurity Plan (ESP). For the renewables industry, a key element is the contract for difference (CfD) auctions, which are now held annually. Furthermore, the government significantly increased the administrative strike price for the upcoming auction in 2024. This is a strong signal from the government, recognising the true cost of delivering offshore wind at scale in the current supply chain constrained environment.\n\nIn the US, we have seen positive support through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was put forward in 2022. The IRA provides USD 0.4-1.2 trillion in funding for investments in climate and renewable energy. However, while offshore wind projects commissioned towards the end of the decade will benefit from the IRA as intended, projects with earlier construction and commission schedules are experiencing challenges in qualifying for the support for domestic content due to the short-term lack of an established US supply chain, which is a prerequisite for getting the highest levels of support.\n\n## Offshore wind industry\n\nOffshore wind remains a high growth industry and an important part of the global energy transition.

While there have been some price increases to power purchase agreements (PPA) and inflation-indexed agreements in certain markets, awarded prices do not yet reflect the higher cost and interest rate levels across all markets. Where prices are not reflective, the developers behind many of the awarded projects are seeking to renegotiate offtake agreements. If unsuccessful, projects may ultimately be terminated. While there has been increased alignment on expectations, the conditions to date have challenged developers to move forward with projects.\n\nIn the current market, the gigawatts auctioned by governments does not meet the demand from developers. As a consequence, some governments choose to conduct auctions based on concession payments as the key decision criteria. To compensate for the upfront payments, developers must put additional pressure on the supply chain, which leaves limited room to invest in scaling manufacturing capacity. Moreover, it limits project-specific solutions that create a positive impact on biodiversity, advance social sustainability, and stimulate innovation and system integration.\n\n## Navigating and shaping the future of renewable energy\n\nThe current market conditions require a new approach and joint industry action. At \u00d8rsted, we are working to navigate and shape the future of renewable energy by engaging the right stakeholders and partners to jointly overcome challenges and create a secure and affordable renewable energy system. Close collaboration between governments and industry has been critical for the industry's maturation to date.\n\nFor offshore wind, regaining momentum is of mutual interest to realise the strong value proposition it offers for societies and its key role in the green energy transition.\n\nTherefore, among our initiatives, we have developed a seven-point plan as an advice for governments and the industry to build momentum and navigate the challenges facing the offshore wind industry. The seven points are to:\n\n- 1   acknowledge the challenges and mobilise political commitment to overcome them to instil market confidence and attract capital\n- 2   build a bridge from development to operation for existing projects to enable the all-important 'next wave' of projects to drive industry investment\n- 3   bring volumes to market and create foresight for demand to unlock supply chain growth\n- 4   design tenders for sustainable industry growth to de-risk the build-out for both developers and energy consumers\n- 5   introduce strong non-price criteria to ensure delivery and value creation while addressing long-term structural barriers to offshore wind build-out\n- 6   ensure predictable, transparent, and fast permitting without compromising on environmental or social sustainability\n- 7   enable and empower a global and sustainable industry by carefully balancing domestic industrial policies with the needs for a level playing field and the potential synergies of global supply chains.\n\nWe believe that governments and industry can work together to weather the current challenges and facilitate future offshore wind deployment.",

Rather, it means reaching leading positions across five pillars: 1) to be one of the world's largest green electricity producers, 2) to be one of the world's largest and most value-creating deployers of capital to the green energy transformation, 3) to be the world's leading talent platform in renewable energy, 4) to be a globally recognised sustainability leader, and 5) to be a core contributor and catalyst for change towards reaching our vision of a world that runs entirely on green energy.\n\nAs with the rest of the industry, we have felt the impact of market challenges over the past few years. This was made especially clear in August when we announced anticipated impairments on our US offshore wind portfolio, in particular attributable to supply chain challenges as well as lack of favourable progress on tax credit guidance and increased interest rates.\n\nWe have learnt from these challenges and are adapting to changing market conditions.\n\nOur fundamental strategic choices on  technologies and regions are unchanged. We aim to be the world leader in offshore wind and a regional player in onshore renewables and P2X in Europe and the US. However, we have accelerated an adaption of our operating model to better match our rapid expansion into the US and Taiwan and the broader market conditions. We have strengthened our risk processes and expanded regular reviews by senior executives and the Board of Directors.\n\nBased on our portfolio review and given our financial position, we have revised our GW ambition for installed renewable energy capacity.

In the US, we have refocused our portfolio towards the Northeast  Atlantic, and to reduce development costs, we are exiting several markets (e.g. Norway, Spain, and Portugal), deprioritising development activities in Japan, and planning for a leaner development within floating wind. Towards 2026, the growth contribution will largely be based on projects already under construction or awarded.\n\nIn onshore renewables, we are growing our platform across the US and Europe, working towards our 2030 ambition of 11-13 GW. Towards 2026, the contribution will come from a mix of projects under construction and in the pipeline. In the US, we are prioritising projects in select energy markets with an eye towards maximising value creation, while we focus on four core markets in Europe (Germany, Spain, the UK, and Ireland).\n\nIn P2X, we plan for a more lean development and are working towards our 2030 ambition of ~1 GW, with projects in development in the US and Scandinavia.\n\nTo enable the build-out, we plan to invest DKK 270 billion in 2024-2030, of which we plan to invest DKK 130 billion trough to 2026. The investments will be distributed between technologies with approx. 70 % within offshore, 25 % within onshore, and 5 % within P2X and Bioenergy.\n\nWe are also taking action to enhance our capability set. We remain confident in our industry-leading scale, execution abilities, and commercial capabilities, but we want to make sure we stay ahead of competition. To enhance our competitiveness, we are adapting our operating model to fit the more unpredictable market and to increase the effectiveness of our organisation. We are also working on improving our revenue capabilities to take advantage of more and more auctions becoming merchant.\n\nWe will continue to collaborate on developing robust integrated solutions with our strategic partners, including leading the structural shift towards corporate demand at scale to deliver electrons at the right place, at the right time, and with the right profile. These efforts are important steps to continue to be a leader within renewable energy.\n\nDespite the current industry headwinds, we believe the future of renewables is bright, and we remain fully confident that we can ensure consistent value creation in the years to come while driving forward the green energy transformation.\n\nThe financial targets and policies and the sustainability ambitions supporting our strategic ambition are highlighted on pages 6 'Strategic ambitions' and 18 'Financial targets and policies'.",

In the following sections, we have outlined some of our concrete achievements in the past year.\n\n## Offshore wind\n\nIn 2023, we took final investment decisions (FIDs) on three development projects, one in each of our three regions: Europe, the US, and APAC, and we further advanced construction of three projects in the regions. We formed valuable partnerships that will help us accelerate the development of offshore wind on the Irish coast and began the deployment of floating offshore wind technologies in Scotland.\n\nWe are the world leader in offshore wind, having developed around a quarter of the global capacity installed, excluding China. We have played a key role in maturing the industry and have built more offshore wind farms worldwide than any other company. By the end of 2023, we had 8.9 GW of capacity installed, 6.7 GW of capacity under construction, and a further 3.7 GW of capacity awarded, resulting in a total capacity of 19.2 GW.\n\nOur commitment to offshore wind is highlighted by our status as the first energy company to join the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA) to  accelerate offshore wind deployment and create a global community of action, consisting of governments and\n\ncompanies. Another important milestone has been reached through a pioneering sustainability partnership between \u00d8rsted and Vestas, both recognised as global leaders in renewable energy. Under this partnership, we commit to source low-carbon steel wind turbine towers and blades made from recycled materials from Vestas for all joint offshore wind projects, advancing the agenda for net-zero wind farms.\n\n## Strategic progress and expansion of our portfolio\n\nIn the UK, a significant milestone was achieved, as our offshore wind farm Hornsea 3 reached FID. With a capacity of around 2.9 GW, the wind farm will become the world's single largest offshore wind farm. Hornsea 3 will provide low-cost, green energy for the UK and deliver thousands of high-quality jobs and  billions of pounds of investment in the UK's offshore wind  supply chain. For Hornsea 4, we received development consent from the British authorities to continue the development of the project. The possible future addition would create an offshore wind cluster in excess of 7 GW, making it the largest offshore wind zone in the world.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, we took FID on Greater Changhua 2b and 4 with expected CODs in 2025. Additionally, we are finalising the construction of Taiwan's first largescale offshore wind farms, Greater Changhua 1 and 2a. The final four of the 111 turbines are expected to be installed in the spring of 2024, and the wind farm will then reach COD, expectedly in Q2 2024.",

Onshore construction has started, and offshore construction will start in 2024, with the completion of the project expected in 2025.\n\nConstruction of our German portfolio is progressing. We have finalised installation of foundations for our offshore wind farm Gode Wind 3, and at Borkum Riffgrund 3, the installation of foundations has commenced. The wind farms have expected CODs in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Once completed, the wind farms will have a total capacity of 1.2 GW.\n\nAt our 130 MW South Fork project in the US, we have installed the first turbines which will send power directly to Long Island, New York. When fully complete, the project will consist of 12 turbines and generate enough renewable energy to power 70,000 US households. Furthermore, we acquired Eversource's 50 % stake in Lease Area 500 adjacent to the associated operational assets, and we now own 100 % of the area.\n\nIn Ireland, we have entered into a partnership with ESB, the leading utility company in the country, to jointly develop an Irish offshore wind portfolio. With a maritime area more than ten times the size of its landmass, Ireland is well-positioned to grow a strong offshore sector. The partnership also encompasses an agreement to explore opportunities from renewable hydrogen produced from the projects in the longer term. The first of the offshore wind projects is expected to compete in the next Irish offshore wind auction.\n\nIn Korea, we have been granted a 1.6 GW electricity business license (EBL) by the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy for an offshore wind project located 70 km off the coast of Incheon City. The license grants us exclusive development rights for the Incheon offshore wind project, which is set to become the largest in Korea on completion, with a capacity to provide renewable energy to over one million Korean households.\n\nIn January 2024, we signed an agreement with Eversource to acquire their 50 % share of Sunrise Wind. The acquisition is subject to the successful award of Sunrise Wind in the ongoing New York 4 solicitation for offshore wind capacity, signing of an OREC contract with New York's energy agency, NYSERDA, entry into longform acquisition agreements, receipt of construction and operations plan (COP) approval, and relevant regulatory approvals. If the project is not successful in the solicitation, the existing OREC contract for Sunrise Wind will be cancelled per the state's requirements, and our 50/50 joint venture with Eversource will remain in place. In that scenario, the joint venture will evaluate its next steps.",

In parallel, we are working collaboratively on the reconfiguration and revised schedule of Baltica 3.\n\n## Ceasing development of Ocean Wind 1 and 2\n\nIn the US, we took the decision to cease the development of the Ocean Wind 1 project, in the form it was awarded by the NJ BPU. The decision was a consequence of additional supplier delays, leading to significant project delays, which, together with a lower anticipated probability of qualifying for tax credits and increasing interest rates, significantly deteriorated the value of the project. We also decided to cease the development of the adjacent Ocean Wind 2 project as currently awarded by the NJ BPU.\n\nAs the OREC we have been awarded for our Skipjack project in Maryland no longer can ensure an investable project, we have decided to withdraw the OREC. In total, the three projects amounted to a capacity of 3.2 GW.\n\n## Farm-downs\n\nDuring 2023, we reached an agreement with funds managed by Schroders Greencoat, a world-renowned specialist asset manager for renewable energy infrastructure assets, to sell our remaining 25 % minority stake in the offshore wind farm London Array in the UK.\n\n- 1 Projects that have reached a level of maturity (e.g., reached site control stage), but not yet taken final investment decision (FID).\n- 2 Early development activities initiated.\n- 3 Farranrory (43.2 MW) was FID'ed in January 2024.\n\nIn addition, we concluded an agreement with Glennmont Partners of Nuveen, an infrastructure fund manager, to farm down 50 % of our shares in Gode Wind 3.\n\nFollowing a competitive divestment process, we selected Cathay Life Insurance, Taiwan's leading insurance company, as the preferred bidder for the acquisition of a 50 % ownership stake in our offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 4 in Taiwan. The dialogue with Cathay Life Insurance is progressing well, and the transaction is expected to close in 2024.\n\n## Onshore renewables\n\nIn 2023, we added three projects to our assets under construction, and four of our projects reached COD, totalling a capacity of 0.6 GW. By the end of 2023, we had 4.8 GW capacity installed and 1.6 GW capacity under construction.\n\nTo reach our ambition of 11-13 GW installed onshore capacity by 2030, we will need to add an additional 4-7 GW to our capacity. The additional capacity will be based on our substantiated pipeline of around 11 GW and other opportunities that may arise.\n\n## Strategic progress and expansion of our portfolio\n\nIn the US, we now have 15 operational onshore wind farms. In 2023, our 201 MW onshore wind farm Sunflower Wind, located in Kansas, became fully operational, making it our latest edition to our growing US onshore portfolio. Sunflower Wind will be capable of providing renewable energy to more than 70,000 US households.",

In Texas, the construction of our 471 MW AC Mockingbird Solar Center is going as planned, with the installation of modules commencing and COD expected in the second half of 2024. In Arizona, construction has begun on our combined Eleven Mile solar PV and storage project, with capacities of 300 MW AC and 300 MW, respectively. The project is expected to reach COD in Q2 2024.\n\nFor the two solar projects Old 300 and the solar part of Helena Energy Center, we have been experiencing detainment of module shipments in 2022 and part of 2023. However, for the solar part of Helena Energy Center, most of the modules have now been cleared from US customs and delivered to the sites. For Old 300, 80 % of the capacity has been commissioned. We expect the solar part of Helena Energy Center to reach COD in Q2 2024 and Old 300 to reach COD in Q3 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we entered into one of the largest solar PV projects in the UK, One Earth Solar Farm, with a capacity of 740 MW AC with associated battery storage. If built, it will be one of the largest solar farms in the country. If constructed, the solar farm in Nottinghamshire will generate enough renewable electricity to power up to 200,000 UK homes. Together with our co-developer PS Renewables, we are aiming for COD before 2030. Additionally, we acquired Garreenleen, one of the largest solar projects in Ireland. With a capacity of 160 MW AC , Garreenleen will be able to power up to 56,000 Irish homes annually. In December, we took FID on the first phase of the project (81 MW AC ). In January 2024, we took FID on Farranrory (43.2 MW). We secured contracts for both projects in the Irish government's\n\nthird onshore action. We expect COD on both projects in 2026. Phase two of Garreenleen (79 MW AC ) is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nIn Germany, we began construction of our wind farm Bahren West 1 (50 MW) in September.\n\nAdditionally, we entered into a partnership with renewable energy developer Terra Solar, headquartered in Dublin, to develop a portfolio of Irish solar projects with a capacity of up to 400 MW AC .\n\nDuring 2023, we signed several offtake contracts, including our first PPA with Google in the US, a 150 MW power purchase agreement spanning a 15-year period. The contract covers more than half of the capacity of our 268 MW Helena Wind Farm located in Texas, the US, and was commissioned in mid-2022. With this agreement, we have entered into PPAs with the tech companies Google, Amazon, and Meta in both Europe and the US as well as with Microsoft in the US.\n\n## Evolving technologies\n\nIn addition to offshore and onshore renewable technologies, we continue to explore possibilities within P2X and carbon capture.\n\n## Strategic progress and expansion of our P2X portfolio\n\nDuring 2023, we entered a new era of sustainable shipping by breaking ground on FlagshipONE, Europe's largest e-methanol project, located in Northern Sweden. We expect the project to start production in 2025.\n\nBreakthrough Energy Catalyst will acquire a 15 % equity interest in FlagshipONE and provide a grant, subject to the fulfilment of funding conditions. Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is a first-of-its-kind model, bringing together government partners and leading organisations from across the private sector to fund and scale emerging climate technologies. With the funding supporting the project, we will seek to sign long-term offtake agreements, creating a new model for the shipping industry to purchase fuel, which will be needed for future projects to secure the capital required to scale the production of green fuels.\n\nIn addition, FlagshipONE is also expected to receive a grant from Horizon Europe and a quasi-equity investment from EIB through InvestEU.\n\nIn the US, we were awarded funding from the Department of Energy (DoE) as one of seven core industry participants in the US HyVelocity Hydrogen Hub. The vision of the HyVelocity Hub, which has been awarded USD 1.2 billion, is to create the nation's largest renewable hydrogen hub along the Gulf Coast. Our share of the funding is approx. USD 143 million.\n\n## Pioneering carbon capture\n\nIn December, we embarked on the construction of the two carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities in our project \u00d8rsted Kalundborg CO 2 Hub. It is expected that the project, which was awarded a 20-year contract by The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) in May 2023, will pave the way for capturing and storing 430,000 tonnes of biogenic carbon dioxide, setting a transformative precedent for our carbon reduction efforts. The project includes the installation of carbon capture technology at our wood chip-fired Asn\u00e6s Power Station in Western\n\n\u2191  Sorne wind farm, Donegal, Ireland.\n\nZealand in Denmark. In addition, we will install CCS technology at the straw-fired boiler at Aved\u00f8re Power Station in the Greater Copenhagen area in Denmark. In direct support to the project, Microsoft has agreed to purchase 2.76 million tonnes of high-quality, durable carbon removal over 11 years from the capture and storage of biogenic carbon. This represents one of the world's largest carbon removal offtake agreements by volume to date.",

A vision that accelerates the energy transition in a way that supports our nature and societies as well as a resilient renewable energy industry. Only then can we deliver the transition at the pace and scale we so urgently need.\n\n## Renewable energy is the cornerstone in the fight against climate change\n\nThe global transition to renewable energy is the most important step we can take to counter climate change. Fossil-based energy continues to make up 74 % of global carbon emissions, and any remaining hope of keeping the rise in the global temperature to 1.5 \u00b0C hinges on immediate action to transform our energy systems at a speed and scale we have not seen before - more precisely, we need to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, as more than 130 governments recently pledged to do at COP28.\n\nTo make this happen, we need far more action than current stated policies and commitments. And with the current challenges facing parts of the renewable energy sector, we risk further delays. Delays that we\n\ndo not have the time for. We must find a way to build renewable energy now - and to do so, we must also build it right .\n\n## How sustainability can help accelerate a successful energy transition towards 2030\n\nThe global renewable energy build-out will be the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken. It also represents an extraordinary opportunity to create positive value for both climate, nature, and wider society. In addition to decarbonising our energy systems, renewable energy provides clean, affordable, and reliable energy, it improves air quality and health, and it strengthens energy security. And, when done sustainably, we can use it to take even further action for our climate and nature and boost local jobs, supply chains, and socio-economic development.\n\nHowever, the build-out of renewable energy is currently facing implementation challenges, not least related to supply chain bottlenecks and concerns over impacts to nature and communities. A sustainable approach is not just a desirable goal we can achieve if we chose to pursue it - it is essential to address these challenges. Building in balance with nature and people is therefore not only the right thing to do but fundamental to enable a transition at pace and scale.\n\nLet's take a closer look at three examples of how a sustainable approach can help tackle some of the key challenges facing the build-out - while delivering a lasting positive impact on wider society.\n\nIt can help strengthen supply chain resilience and play a role in decarbonising carbon emission intensive sectors\n\nResilient renewable energy supply chains are essential to deliver a rapid transition, but bottlenecks and material scarcities are slowing progress in many markets. We can reduce some of these pressures mediumto long-term through a strategic use of decarbonisation and circularity efforts. By considering material mix, increasing recycling and reusing, and innovating for low-emission solutions, we can reduce the demand for virgin materials and alleviate capacity pressures while also diversifying suppliers.\n\nMoreover, by driving decarbonisation efforts throughout the supply chain, the renewable energy sector can make additional contributions to global climate targets. Our supply chains are dependent on carbon emission intensive sectors such as steel and shipping, which account for 7 % and 3 % of global emissions, respectively, and reducing emissions from these is\n\ntherefore critical to limit global heating. By collaborating with our suppliers and other industries that share the same supply chains, we can help incentivise and drive demand for net-zero solutions. At \u00d8rsted, we work to do this through our science-based netzero 2040 target validated by the SBTi.\n\nIt can support the co-use of land and ocean and help revive nature\n\nThe space required for the build-out will be significant, raising the need to find suitable areas at land and ocean where renewable energy can coexist with other users and nature. How we plan and manage the use of space is therefore of huge importance, and to be granted access to build renewables, we need to site thoughtfully. That is, in ways that respect other users, maximise space efficiency, and minimise environmental impacts.\n\nThis is of particular importance as we are not only fighting a global climate crisis but also a biodiversity crisis. These two are often portrayed as being  conflicting agendas, competing for space. However, they are in fact deeply interconnected, and we can take action to make them mutually supportive. As such, the buildout brings a unique potential to unite action on the two biggest crises of our time if we integrate action on nature protection, restoration, and enhancement into how we build and operate renewable energy.\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we have set the ambition that all new renewable energy projects we commission from 2030 onwards should deliver a net-positive biodiversity impact, and we have built an innovative and business-inclusive approach to get us there.",

        "page_content": "It can facilitate community support\n\n## Policy makers:\n\nand deliver a positive impact on people A clear majority of the world's population supports renewable energy. However, for the communities living close to renewable energy projects, support is sometimes replaced by concerns. To maintain the pace and scale of the build-out, it is crucial that we engage and consult with impacted communities to understand their needs and priorities and ensure they benefit from the energy transition too.\n\nIn addition, renewable energy is, or will become, a new industry in many parts of the world. We can build it up in a way that generates millions of well-paid jobs. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the transition towards net-zero will lead to an estimated increase in energy sector jobs of 14 million by 2030. We can also use it to boost local supply chains and actively deliver and share benefits with communities through initiatives such as local job and training opportunities or co-ownership of assets. Realising this potential is a core part of how we want to drive the build-out at \u00d8rsted, and we work hard to identify and integrate local jobs, training, and community engagement opportunities into our project delivery.\n\n## Here is how we can do it - a call to action\n\nIt is clear that if we are to deliver an energy transition at the pace and scale needed to meet the Paris Agreement, we must build sustainably. This will take ambitious action and enhanced collaboration. We therefore encourage all relevant actors to come together now - to use our voice and respective capabilities to facilitate and push for a sustainable build-out.\n\nThe starting point is for policymakers to further include environmental and social perspectives beyond price into renewable energy deployment where this is not yet the case. Focusing only on price incentivises developers to solely optimise for the minimal cost of energy, undermining efforts to avoid and mitigate sustainability impact and resulting in a missed opportunity for the wider societal value creation the sector can deliver. By incorporating supplementary criteria on societal value in tenders, governments can effectively incentivise such efforts - and simultaneously increase acceptance for the energy transition.\n\n## The renewable energy industry:\n\nA critical step towards rewarding societal value creation is the development of industry standards and measurement frameworks. This will also enable a more transparent and level playing field for which the industry can compete. At \u00d8rsted, we are using our expertise to support this, and we have already made great strides for carbon, creating an industry life cycle assessment (LCA) model for offshore wind together with The Carbon Trust and 11 energy peers to measure and compare carbon emission footprints. We are also collaborating with the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) to develop a measurement framework for biodiversity and with a range of partners, including the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Capitals Coalition, to define how to measure and track social impact that matters to our communities. Further joining forces on this with peers will be a powerful accelerator for success for the industry.\n\n## Other industries:\n\nWith a strong and collective demand pool across industries that share materials, we can more effectively incentivise investments in the sustainable solutions we all need. The First Movers Coalition is a great example of this. Here, we are building demand for decarbonised steel and concrete across industries, creating incentives and opportunities for new low-emission technologies, partnerships, and ecosystems along the way. We can expand this approach to many more areas, using our combined power to drive real and fast transformation across supply chains.\n\n## NGOs and academia:\n\nFinally, as an industry, we must continue to work together with NGOs and academia to join forces on advancing research and innovation. By combining our capabilities, we can accelerate learnings on measures and solutions and more strongly advocate for a buildout that is done right and done fast.\n\n## Let's do it right, now\n\nAchieving the renewable energy build-out at the pace and scale needed will be a massive undertaking unlike anything we have done before. We have much work ahead of us, and while the road is far from easy, collectively, we can choose to act now to facilitate the energy transition we so urgently need - in harmony with nature and people. The good news is that we know what is needed and have most of the solutions ready; now we need accelerated action and will to scale a fast and sustainable build-out. Let's do it right, now.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191  3D-printed reefs.",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to sustainability\n\nSustainability is integral to how we operate as a business. On the following pages, we zoom in on focus areas currently guiding our approach and work. For detailed information on our sustainability efforts, including ambitions, actions, and performance data, please see the 'Sustainability statements' section.\n\n## Creating value through sustainability\n\nThroughout everything we do, we are guided by how and where we can create the most value for both society and our business. We believe being clear on this is crucial to credibly set and deliver on ambitions as well as to direct efforts and resources to where we have the biggest potential for impact.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, we are guided by how we can best use our position, capabilities, and reach to address our key impacts as a renewable energy developer, including those where we must either mitigate negative impacts or are in a unique position to deliver positive value.\n\nFrom a business perspective, it is about using sustainability to help strengthen our resilience and ability to compete in a world with both increasing stakeholder expectations and challenges. We work strategically with sustainability to open new doors to customers, partnerships, and commercial opportunities. We employ it to optimise our resource use and secure access to critical materials, new technologies, and talent. And we use it to attract financing and to develop resilient projects that can proactively address stakeholder expectations, avoid delays, and meet permitting and regulatory requirements.\n\nCombined, these considerations have led to the formulation of our four strategic focus areas: Sciencealigned climate action; Green energy that revives nature; A green transformation that works for people; and Governance that enables the right decisions and underlying priorities, see page 33. Together, the four areas respond to our material sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\nClimate change, resource use and circular economy, workers in the value chain, and affected communities (topics E1, E5, S2, and S3 according to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)) are assessed to be our most material sustainability matters, followed by biodiversity and ecosystems, own workforce, and business conduct (ESRS E4, S1, and G1). To read more about how we have identified these through a double materiality assessment, see the 'General' section in the sustainability statements on pages 68-79.\n\n## Delivering on sustainability\n\n- - moving from target to action\n\nIt is the actions we take in the real world - the impact that we have on the ground - which matter the most. In recent years, we have committed to ambitious, and often long-term, targets. Translating these into tangible action today is a key focus of our work to demonstrate continuous progress and avoid long-term commitments failing to make a short-term impact.\n\nIn 2023, we have again taken action to progress across our four focus areas. See selected highlights to the right.\n\n## Selected 2023 highlights across our focus areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Science-aligned climate action\n\nLaunched partnerships together with our strategic partners to reduce emissions from the key elements of an offshore wind farm, including towers, blades, and foundations. As the world's largest offshore wind developer, we play a key role in incentivising investments in low-emission solutions. These solutions will not only benefit the climate but also our customers and business as it will help us meet future demands for net-zero solutions and future-proof our operating model in the medium- to long-term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Green energy that revives nature\n\nMade important progress towards our net-positive biodiversity ambition, successfully testing our biodiversity measurement framework, which will help us measure biodiversity losses and gains at our assets, and initiating exciting new pilots to further innovate solutions, including our BioReef project in Denmark and our prairie restoration project in the US. These projects are a cornerstone of our approach as we are still learning and exploring along the way on how to best meet our commitment.\n\n## A green transformation that works for people\n\nAs a testament to our aspiration to deliver a build-out that works for people, we took the first steps towards measuring the total economic value (TEV) of our jobs and skills-building efforts. This will be an important tool going forward to demonstrate the value we can create for society.\n\nLaunched \u00d8rsted's first Youth Panel comprised of eight young climate action leaders outside of \u00d8rsted. By bringing them together with \u00d8rsted's top decision-makers and integrating their perspectives into our corporate discussions centered around our sustainability agenda, the panel will serve as a platform for mutual learning and exchange to strengthen our sustainability efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance that enables the right decisions\n\nLaunched a series of new initiatives to make our offices even more sustainable, introducing improved waste sorting as well as updated and more inclusive facilities, including spiritual and baby care rooms.",

Based on the taxonomy, we have now defined a sustainability standard for all \u00d8rsted assets, and we are working to integrate performance requirements into our asset project model and relevant decision gates to ensure that all assets we build are taxonomy-aligned.\n\nWe have also defined annual wheels for sustainability involvement for our Board of Directors and top management committees, including our Group Executive Team, Sustainability Committee, and Audit & Risk Committee, and we have integrated sustainability metrics into our bi-annual portfolio review to inform our leadership of how their decisions impact our ability to meet our 2040 net-zero target.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue this work along with an increased focus on building sustainability competences across the entire organisation, including for our top management and Board of Directors, to ensure we have the right expertise and understanding of sustainability at all levels.\n\nAltogether, at \u00d8rsted, we work to push the renewable energy transition forward, by being a leading voice for a resilient and sustainable renewable energy industry and by demonstrating how renewable energy, when done right, can create transformational value for both society and business.",

We aim to mitigate our risks and reduce them to an acceptable level through risk management.\n\n## How we assess risk\n\nEach year, we perform a risk assessment with the overall objective of identifying our most significant business, sustainability, and legal risks. All business segments, regions, and selected staff functions identify and prioritise business risks. An assessment is made of the potential financial impact of individual risks, and whether they are of a short-term (0-2 years), a medium-term (2-5 years), a long-term (5+ years), or a recurring nature. All our risks are then consolidated and evaluated at Group level.\n\nBusiness risks are defined as incidents that, with some likelihood, will materialise and cause a negative impact on our earnings and costs and hence impact our credit rating and value. Many of our risks are interdependent, and movements in the macroeconomic environment will likely impact multiple business risks.\n\nThe top six business risks identified are shown to the right where they are illustrated based on their potential impact (post-risk mitigation) on our value and credit metrics over the next years. You can read more about these risks on the following pages.\n\nWhen we invest in new assets and activities or divest assets, the consolidated risks associated with our portfolio change. Therefore, we assess the impact of a given decision on the portfolio upfront and work systematically with risks.\n\n## How we manage risk\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees our risk management in general and have delegated the oversight of our financial and business-related risks to the Audit & Risk Committee. The responsibility for each of the individual risks identified as part of the annual risk assessment rests with a member of the Group Executive Team.\n\nThe purpose of our risk management is to identify and quantify our risks and decide how best to manage and mitigate them on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn recent years, we have seen substantial adverse impacts on our business from financial risks and risks in relation to the development and construction of assets. This has led us to start implementing a new framework for governing our financial risks. Furthermore, we are implementing the learnings from our review of the Ocean Wind 1 project into the governance of our operating model to reduce risks in the development and execution of projects, with a particular focus on monitoring of and updates on project execution including risk reviews with the Group Executive Team and the Board of Directors, structured\n\nexternal reviews for select projects, internal peer assessments, contingency planning (including more proactive contracting for back-up supply chain capacity), and monitoring of suppliers (including from site visits to track manufacturing progress). Furthermore, we will prioritise inflation protection in offtake arrangements in future projects.\n\nWe will continue our work to manage future breakaway profiles by scrutinising financial commitments before taking final investment decision (FID) to avoid high capital commitments relative to project maturity, and by ensuring greater  flexibility on project timelines and commissioning dates as well as phasing of CAPEX.\n\nBesides business risks (incl. financial risks), we also manage risks in connection with legal compliance and sustainability risks, both at a strategic and operational level.\n\n## Development in risks in 2023\n\nWe have introduced 'Farm-downs and partnerships' as a new top six risk in 2023 and have seen changes in the relative importance of our top risks from last year.\n\n'Supply chain and cost inflation' is now assessed to be our largest risk. Throughout the year, we have seen bottlenecks in several parts of our supply chain, leading to increased costs and risk of delayed projects.\n\nQuantification of risks is based on a scenario where the risk occurs with 10 % probability (P90). Our Internal Audit function has examined the process for identifying and measuring the accompanying portfolio risks.\n\ne\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nn v\n\nt o\n\nc\n\na\n\np\n\nm\n\nI\n\n## Top 6 business risks\n\nEffect on our value and credit metric\n\n- Change in risk quadrant from 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact on FFO/adjusted net debt\n\n| 6   | 5 \u2191   | 1 3 \u2191   |\n|-----|-------|---------|\n|     |       | 4 \u2193     |\n| Low |       | High    |\n\n- 1 (#3 in 2022) Supply chain and cost inflation\n- 2 (#1 in 2022) Inflation, interest rate, and currency risks\n- 3 (New in 2023) Farm-downs and partnerships\n- 4 (#2 in 2022) Power prices and energy markets\n- 5 (#6 in 2022) Cybersecurity\n- 6 (#5 in 2022) Competition",

Furthermore, the financial position of several suppliers in the market is stretched.\n\n'Inflation, interest rate, and currency risks' is now assessed to be our second-largest risk. During the year, we have continued to see increasing inflation and interest rates across our markets. Higher interest rates have had an adverse impact on our WACCs and a negative effect on the NPVs of our projects, leading to impairments on our US portfolio.\n\n'Farm-downs and partnerships' is placed as our third-largest risk. Higher interest rates and increased\n\nglobal geopolitical uncertainty are negatively impacting investor demand for renewable assets. Furthermore, the recent challenges in the offshore industry have led to multiple renewables companies rebalancing their investments and looking to divest parts of their portfolio, which might increase the supply of renewable assets to potential investors.\n\n'Power prices and energy markets' has moved down and is assessed as our fourth-largest risk in 2023. During 2023, energy prices have stabilised at a lower level compared to 2022, resulting in a partial reversal of cash posted for collateral and a reduction of our negative hedge reserve. The combination of lower hedge levels (in accordance with our new energy\n\nhedge framework), lower power prices, and fewer trades on exchanges subject to collateral have led to a reduction of this risk.\n\n'Cybersecurity' has moved up as our fifth-largest risk. The geopolitical development over the past years has shown that cyberattacks remain a threat to our operations. It is of the utmost importance that we protect our infrastructure and systems from malicious attacks. Furthermore, we can see that the demand for cybersecurity professionals continue to rise and currently outpace availability.\n\n'Competition' remains in our top six risks but has dropped to our sixth-largest risk, mainly because other risks have increased in magnitude.\n\n## Extreme events\n\nIn addition to our ordinary business risks, we are exposed to risks which have a very small  probability of occurring, but which could potentially impact our finances or reputation substantially. These risks include but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 fatal  injuries\n- \u00b7 direct or indirect consequences of war and geopolitical activity, which may lead to loss of production or assets or disrupt the financial and energy markets through extreme price movements and volatility\n- \u00b7 strong hurricanes, typhoons, hailstorms, arctic blasts, or earthquakes, especially in Taiwan and the US, which may lead to the partial loss of offshore and  onshore wind farms, solar farms, and storage assets\n- \u00b7 broken pipes at the Nybro Gas Treatment Plant in Denmark, which may lead to personal injury and damage to the environment\n- \u00b7 breakdowns at power stations that may lead to personal injury and partial loss of assets.\n\n## Sustainability-related risks\n\nClimate and sustainability-related risks present financial risk to the global economy as well as a risk to our planet as we know it. In \u00d8rsted, climate and sustainability-related risks and opportunities are directly linked to our green vision and strategy, and we address them as an integral part of our daily business.\n\nFor several years, we have reported on climate- related risks and opportunities as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD). This year, the climate change section in our new sustainability statements and the strategy and governance sections in the management's review cover all relevant TCFD disclosures. A full overview of our TCFD disclosures can be seen on page 139.\n\nIn the sustainability statements, we have included a double materiality assessment (DMA). For impacts deemed significant or crucial, we have disclosed our mitigating actions. To read more, see page 70.\n\nLastly, during 2023, we have assessed whether our taxonomy-eligible activities are taxonomy-aligned by determining if they: 1) contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, 2) do no significant harm to the other environmental objectives, and 3) comply with the minimum safeguards. Our assessment showed that all our eligible activities were aligned.",

        "page_content": "- 1. Supply chain and cost inflation\n- 2. Inflation, interest rate, and currency risks\n\n## Description\n\nAs a global renewable energy developer, we are exposed to risks related to cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, the performance of our suppliers, and our suppliers' financial positions.\n\nAmong other things, we are exposed to highly volatile prices, which are influenced by high global demand with widespread application in various sectors.\n\nAs the industry continuously grows with new technological developments and enters new markets, we are exposed to potential bottlenecks in parts of the supply chain if there is no regional supply chain or only a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting future demands.\n\nWe are also exposed to counterparty risks if one of our suppliers should default or deliver unsatisfactory products. Furthermore, we are exposed to risks, such as import restrictions and price increases related to trade restrictions.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nThe inability of our suppliers to deliver on agreed schedules, lack of available production capacity or transportation and installations vessels, and sudden inflation in key materials could result in project delays and budget overruns as well as cancellation of projects.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe enter into volume agreements and source wind turbines from key suppliers in a timely manner to reduce uncertainty, and we have entered into long-term vessel supply contracts. Based on the learnings from our US projects, we are currently adjusting our operating model to strengthen the focus on suppliers and introduce more flexibility and alternatives in our project plans and installation schedules.\n\nTo mitigate cost inflation risks, we have implemented a hedging programme for steel and other commodities, which will be rolled out to our asset projects.\n\nOur process for vetting new suppliers is thorough, and we have strict credit risk policies in place to manage credit and counterparty risks.\n\n## Description\n\nOur inflation, interest rate, and currency risks are related to volatility in the macroeconomic environment where we operate. Changes to inflation rates, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates all have an impact on the value of our assets.\n\nWe are exposed to inflation both directly through the real return but also indirectly through cost inflation and higher interest rates. Approx. 45 % of our revenue in 2024-2030 is inflation-indexed and expected to follow the development in consumer prices, thereby protecting the real value of our assets and equity. However, for assets and in markets where we don't have inflation-indexed PPAs or subsidies, we are exposed to inflation risks where an increase in inflation will adversely impact the expected real value of our revenue.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in interest rates, inflation, and foreign exchange rates may adversely impact our earnings and the value of our assets.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe actively incentivise investing in assets and entering into contracts with inflation-indexed revenue streams to mitigate cost inflation, and we match our debt with our assets per currency and the same payment structures (modified duration). Hence, our European fixed nominal subsidies are being offset by EUR-denominated fixedrate debt. In contrast, we have entered into inflation swaps for part of our inflation-indexed revenue in the UK to match our nominal GBP debt. In new markets, we execute interest rate swaps to lock in interest rates before financing is secured.\n\nOur currency exposure is managed by hedging more in the near years and less in the later years over a fiveyear horizon.\n\nRead more about inflation and interest rate risks in note 6.3 'Inflation and interest rate risks' and about currency risks in note 6.4 'Currency risks'.\n\n## 3. Farm-downs and partnerships\n\n## Description\n\nThe partnership strategy in \u00d8rsted continues to be a cornerstone in managing financial planning and reaching our strategic ambition, with a sizeable number of farm-downs and joint venture partnerships expected in the coming years. This entails risks related to delays, lower proceeds, the lack of potential buyers, regulatory and contractual restrictions, and the macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to complete future farm-downs of projects or delays could lead to an adverse impact on our credit rating and value. Furthermore, increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on investment capacity and on the value extracted from partnerships.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe have years of experience in handling all aspects of divestment and partnership processes with a strong track record of creating value through our partnership model.\n\nOur highly experienced team is capable of not only managing the equity transaction; it also takes lead on structuring the financing package together with or on behalf of the partners.\n\nWe continuously engage with current and future investors and partners to help secure demand for our portfolio of assets.\n\n- 4. Power prices and energy markets\n\n## Description\n\nPower price risks primarily originate from the sale of our renewable power generation in the UK, the US, and north-western Europe. Our CHP plants constitute a spread risk due to the difference between prices of the power generated and the fuel consumed (i.e., biomass, coal, gas, and carbon dioxide allowances).\n\nWe are also exposed to second-order risks arising from power price hedges not fully matching our actual revenue exposure (i.e. position, intermittency, and regulatory risks). Furthermore, we are exposed to liquidity risks where we are required to post collateral at exchanges if our positions are 'out of the money' (which was the case when the energy prices soared throughout 2022). Lastly, we are exposed to risks related to government intervention (i.e. price caps, taxation of windfall profits, etc.).\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in energy prices and energy policies can have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nApprox. 80 % of our expected revenue from generation of power from renewable offshore and onshore assets in 2024-2030 has no exposure to power price risk as the price is either regulated through subsidies or contracted through CPPAs. This significantly reduces our exposure towards volatility in power prices.\n\nWe manage the remaining 20 % of our exposure through a hedge framework, under which we hedge up to 70 % of the power production volume in the first two years. The 70 % is set based on an assessment about uncertainties related to power generation volumes. The hedge level is based on a holistic assessment of the risk profile of the combined offshore and onshore assets as well as the balance between market, credit, and liquidity risks.\n\nRead more about our risk framework and energy price risks in notes 6.1 'Risk framework' and 6.2 'Energy price risks'.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Cybersecurity\n\n## 6. Competition\n\n## Description\n\nThe cybersecurity risks are a product of individuals, groups, and nations actively working to harm and profit off of \u00d8rsted. As a global renewable energy major, we are exposed to several different cyberattack threats: ransomware attacks, data exfiltration attacks, cyber-physical impact attacks, and more. Our  adversaries' capacities and capabilities are constantly improving, and we must strive to stay ahead.\n\nFurthermore, the energy crisis and the ongoing war in Ukraine have resulted in an increased cyber threat in a geopolitical context where Russian hackers have been known to target energy grids and assets.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nMinor digital risk events, such as viruses and attempted break-ins, are everyday risks without significant impact. However, major cyberattacks or events may impact all or part of our assets or, in the event of a ransomware attack, have an impact on our financial position.\n\n## Mitigation initiatives\n\nWe face different types of cyber risks. Some are related to our assets and some to our systems. Thus, we mitigate cyber risks with several different initiatives, which are continuously assessed and prioritised based on our strategic cybersecurity risk assessment with the aim of lowering our risk exposure.\n\nAt our operating assets, we have deployed production cyber defences to enhance protection against onsite and offsite attacks. In addition, we have a top-level information and cybersecurity management system and framework supported by our global governance model. We also have regular trainings and roll-out of new security measures as they are approved.\n\nThis way, our cyber capability is continuously improved in order to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover across the enterprise and production sites.\n\n## Description\n\nGlobal renewable energy markets are expected to grow rapidly over the next decade within all the technologies where we are present. Key drivers for this growth are ambitious government policies and targets and the push from corporates for the green transition. The growth prospect is attracting significant interest from existing and new players.\n\nIn offshore wind, the competitive auction and tender mechanics being implemented across the various regions and markets are becoming more competitive and diversified. While the mature European markets increasingly want innovation and system integration (e.g. storage and renewable hydrogen) to play an increasingly important role in auctions and tenders, developing markets in Europe, the US, and Asia Pacific often emphasise costs and job creation as determination criteria. Similarly in Onshore, we see solar PV continuing to gain market shares relative to onshore wind due to cost reductions. As demand hours shift with growing solar penetration, solar PV projects lose market value, and combined solar PV and storage solutions become necessary to capitalise on higher pricing hours.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nThere is a risk that we will not win the targeted capacity in the auctions and tenders in which we participate, or that our value creation from the projects we win ends up being lower than targeted, which might increase pressure on our credit rating metric and our value.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo ensure our competitive edge, we continue to utilise portfolio-scale advantages and knowhow gained from previously executed projects to develop supply chain solutions and reduce costs and risks. Over the last year, we have performed a strategic review of all our assets and regions and are firmer in prioritising the auctions and tenders in which we participate, which limits our DEVEX spent before taking final investment descision. Furthermore, we have and will continue to enter into strategic partnerships to strengthen our position in all the regions where we operate.\n\n## Legal compliance\n\n## Description\n\nRisks associated with legal compliance are assessed based on financial and reputational significance and probability. Our most significant risks are 1) tax law, 2) financial regulation, and 3) tender law. (1) We operate in tax regimes with different tax rules and rates, and our tax affairs span over corporate tax compliance, transfer pricing, and indirect taxes. (2) We are subject to several financial regulations, such as REMIT, MAR, EMIR, Dodd Frank, MiFID, SFTR, and AML1. The financial regulations are relevant for a large part of our activities. (3) Many of our purchases of goods, services, and work in the EU are subject to EU and local tender rules.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to comply with the above-mentioned rules and regulations may result in severe legal sanctions, such as imprisonment, fines, and damage claims, but will also impact sourcing processes and subsequently increase the risk of project delays.\n\n## Mitigating initiatives\n\n(1) We have implemented a comprehensive tax control framework and a mandatory compliance framework, including transfer pricing documentation, in line with OECD recommendations and local requirements. This has been prepared on a contemporary basis to mitigate our tax risks. (2) We have implemented comprehensive policies, procedures, training, and controls for relevant parts of our business to ensure compliance with financial regulations. (3) To ensure compliance with tender laws, our legal team carries out training courses for procurement teams in basic tender law and practical courses on how to apply the standard tender documents. The legal team also works closely together with the procurement team on major tenders.",

We also had lower balancing costs due to power prices decreasing at a faster pace than expected. Furthermore, we decided to reduce our project development activities as a result of the adverse developments on our US portfolio, and we had a positive impact from reversal of wake and warranty provisions. This was only partly offset by the divestment of London Array, which was not included in our guidance and resulted in lower site earnings.\n\nEarnings in Onshore ended up significantly lower than expected due to lower power prices, lower wind speeds, and lower availability due to outages at a number of our assets.\n\nEarnings from our CHP plants were lower than expected due to much lower power prices than anticipated.\n\nThis led to lower condensing power generation and negative accounting effects from the first-in, first-out principle. This was only partly offset by a compensation from Energinet related to their order in 2022, but recognised in 2023, when we had to continue or resume operations of three power station units.\n\nIn 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure', we achieved higher earnings from our gas storage activities than expected.\n\n## Q4 EBITDA\n\nEarnings came in higher than expected in our interim report for the first nine months, primarily due to higher wind speeds for offshore assets, the wake and warranty provision reversals, the compensation from Energinet, and higher earnings on our gas activities.\n\n## EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Results\n\n## Financial results\n\n## Revenue\n\n## EBITDA\n\nPower generation from offshore and onshore assets increased by 5 % and totalled 31.1 TWh in 2023. The increase was due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 and 2a, our onshore assets Old 300, Ford Ridge, and Sunflower Wind, and the wind part of Helena Energy Center. The ramp-up of generation was partly offset by lower availability, the farm-down of Hornsea 2 in Q3 2022, and the divestment of London Array in Q3 2023.\n\nHeat generation increased by 3 %, mainly due to colder weather, whereas thermal power generation decreased by 26 %, mainly due to less attractive spreads for power condensing generation.\n\nOur renewable share of generation amounted to 93 %, 2 percentage points higher than last year, driven by higher generation from offshore assets due to rampup at Greater Changhua 1 and 2a and Hornsea 2. This was partly offset by the farm-down of 50 % of Hornsea 2 in Q3 2022.\n\nRevenue amounted to DKK 79.3 billion. The decrease of 31 % relative to 2022 was primarily due to the significantly lower power and gas prices across all markets as well as lower power and gas volumes sold.\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) for the year amounted to DKK 18.7 billion, DKK 13.3 billion lower than in 2022. In 2023, we had cancellation fees of DKK 9.6 billion related to our decision to cease the development of Ocean Wind 1. In both years, we had significant effects from gains on farm-downs. In 2023, we divested our ownership share of London Array and farmed down 50 % of Gode Wind 3, whereas we farmed down 50 % of Borkum Riffgrund 3 and Hornsea 2 in 2022. EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees was DKK 3.0 billion higher than in 2022 and amounted to DKK 24.0 billion. For further information on our provision for cancellation fees, see note 3.10 'Provision and contingent liabilities' in the financial statements.\n\nEBITDA from offshore sites amounted to DKK 20.2 billion, an increase of DKK 10.3 billion compared to last year. The increase was mainly due to ramp-up of generation from Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 and 2a in 2023, higher prices on the inflation-indexed CfD and ROC wind farms, lower balancing and BSUoS costs, good performance from our power trading activities, slightly higher wind speeds, and a significant negative impact from hedges in 2022 which was not repeated in 2023.\n\n## EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial results\n\n| DKKm                                                | 2023     | 2022    | %       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue                                             | 79,255   | 114,417 | (31 %)  |\n| EBITDA                                              | 18,717   | 32,057  | (42 %)  |\n| New partnerships                                    | 4,324    | 10,993  | (61 %)  |\n| Cancellation fees                                   | (9,621)  | -       | n.a.    |\n| EBITDA excl. new partnerships and cancellation fees | 24,014   | 21,064  | 14 %    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                       | (9,795)  | (9,754) | 0 %     |\n| Impairment losses                                   | (26,775) | (2,529) | 959 %   |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)                      | (17,853) | 19,774  | n.a.    |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises            | 234      | 331     | (29 %)  |\n| Financial items, net                                | (1,443)  | (2,536) | (43 %)  |\n| Profit before tax                                   | (19,026) | 17,609  | n.a.    |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                   | (1,156)  | (2,613) | (56 %)  |\n| Tax rate                                            | (6 %)    | 15 %    | (21 %p) |\n| Profit (loss) for the year                          | (20,182) | 14,996  | n.a.    |",

        "page_content": "## EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis was partly offset by a negative impact on our merchant exposure due to declining prices after having lowered our hedge ratios for 2023 at a time when prices were higher than the realised levels in the period.\n\nEBITDA from existing partnerships amounted to DKK 0.9 billion in 2023, mainly from adjustment of wake and warranty provisions. This was partly offset by a reduction in earnings from our construction agreement on Greater Changhua 1, due to higher costs and later commissioning of the wind turbines.\n\nIn 2022, we had positive earnings from a reversal of DKK 0.5 billion of the DKK 0.8 billion warranty provision related to the cable protection system issues at some of our offshore wind farms towards our partners, recognised in 2021, and from an adjustment to wake loss provisions in our German portfolio.\n\nEBITDA from our onshore business amounted to DKK 3.0 billion in 2023, DKK 0.7 billion lower than in 2022. Ramp-up of generation from new assets was more than offset by lower prices in the US and in the UK and Ireland and by lower generation in the US driven by lower availability due to outages at a number of our assets and lower wind speeds.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants amounted to DKK 1.2 billion in 2023, a decrease of DKK 4.6 billion compared to the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to very high power prices and favourable spreads for power condensing generation in 2022 not being repeated in 2023. In addition, earnings from power generation were negatively impacted by the high costs of biomass and coal relative to the market prices in 2023, as the cost is measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. The fuel we used during 2023 was bought last year at higher price levels. The opposite was the case in 2022. The negative impacts were partly offset by a compensation from Energinet related to their order in 2022 when we had to continue or resume operations of three power station units.\n\nEBITDA from our gas business totalled DKK 0.6 billion in 2023, DKK 2.6 billion lower than last year. The decrease was driven by strong earnings in 2022, when we were able to lock in gains from optimising the offtake flexibility in some of our sourcing contracts and storages, which was partly offset by our decision to unwind gas hedges related to the Gazprom Export contract.\n\n## Impairment\n\nDue to adverse impacts relating to the supply chain and increased interest rates, combined with a lower anticipated probability of getting additional tax credits, a lower expected value from monetising these, and the timing and likelihood of obtaining final construction permits for Ocean Wind 1 as well as a change in OREC assumptions for Sunrise Wind, we recognised impairment losses of DKK 26.8 billion in 2023. The majority of these (DKK 19.9 billion) related to our US offshore project Ocean Wind 1. See note 3.2 'Impairments' in the financial statements for further information.\n\n## EBIT\n\nEBIT decreased by DKK 37.6 billion to DKK -17.9 billion in 2023, primarily due to impairment losses and cancellation fees. EBIT excluding impairments and cancellation fees amounted to DKK 18.5 billion in 2023. This was a decrease of DKK 3.8 billion compared to 2022 but an increase of DKK 2.9 billion excluding earnings from new partnerships.\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nNet financial income and expenses amounted to DKK -1.4 billion compared to DKK -2.5 billion in 2022. The lower net expenses were mainly due to a gain of DKK 2.4 billion from ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps driven by less funding needs in the US after our decision to cease Ocean Wind 1, partly offset by negative exchange rate adjustments related to internal loans in 2023 versus positive adjustments in 2022, neither of which had impact on cash flow and NIBD.\n\n## Tax and tax rate\n\nTax on profit for the year amounted to DKK 1.2 billion, DKK 1.5 billion lower than last year. The tax rate was -6 % and was affected by non-taxable gains on London Array and Gode Wind 3, unrecognised deferred tax assets related to impairment losses and cancellation fees on our US portfolio, and a reversal of a recognised deferred tax liability in the US related to the tax equity partnership for Ocean Wind 1.\n\n## Profit for the year\n\nProfit for the year totalled DKK -20.2 billion, DKK 35.2 billion lower than 2022. The decrease was mainly due to impairment losses and cancellation fees. Profit for the year excluding impairment losses (after tax) and cancellation fees amounted to DKK 14.9 billion.",

In 2022, we tied up DKK 6.9 billion. The development was driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 the variation margin payments, which were a cash inflow of DKK 7.1 billion versus a cash outflow of 10.3 billion in 2022\n- \u00b7 the initial margin payments, which were a cash inflow of DKK 2.4 billion versus a cash inflow of DKK 3.5 billion in 2022\n- \u00b7 in 2022, we issued parent company guarantees (PCG) in total of EUR 1 billion to reduce our initial margin payments and, to some extent, variation margin payments. The PCG were only partly utilised at the end of 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we had a net cash outflow from work in progress of DKK 0.7 billion, mainly from construction work at Greater Changhua 1 and the Hornsea 3 offshore transmission asset, partly offset by the divestment of the remaining 50 % of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 2 and milestone payments from partners in Gode Wind 3.\n\nIn 2022, we had a net cash inflow of DKK 4.3 billion, mainly from the divestment of the first 50 % of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 2 to our partner and receipt of milestone payments from partners in Borkum Riffgrund 3. This was partly offset by construction work at Greater Changhua 1.\n\nIn 2023, we received tax equity contributions from partners for Sunflower Wind and South Fork, and in 2022, we received tax equity contributions for the wind part of Helena Energy Center and Old 300, phase 1. This led to a cash inflow from tax equity contributions in 2023, net of the reversal of tax credits recognised in EBITDA, compared to a net cash outflow last year.\n\nFurthermore, 'Change in other working capital' was positively impacted by lower receivables and the lower value of gas at storage due to the falling prices in 2023 in addition to the aforementioned release of initial margin payments. In 2022, the positive effect in 'Change in other working capital' from lower initial margins was partly offset by higher fuel inventories and lower payables.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 38.5 billion in 2023. The main investments were:\n\n- \u00b7 offshore wind farms (DKK 28.6 billion), including Greater Changhua 1, 2a, 2b, and 4 in Taiwan, our portfolio of US and German projects, and Hornsea 3\n- \u00b7 onshore wind and solar farms (DKK 9.1 billion), including the construction of Eleven Mile, Mockingbird, Sunflower Wind, the solar part of Helena Energy Center, and our portfolio of European projects.\n\n## Cash flows and net debt\n\n| DKKm                                            | 2023     | 2022     | %      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities            | 28,532   | 11,924   | 139 %  |\n| EBITDA                                          | 18,717   | 32,057   | (42 %) |\n| Reversal of gain (loss) on divestment of assets | (5,745)  | (10,885) | (47 %) |\n| Change in derivatives, excl. variation margin   | (2,812)  | 1,645    | n.a.   |\n| Change in variation margin                      | 7,086    | (10,332) | n.a.   |\n| Change in provisions                            | 8,454    | (1,935)  | n.a.   |\n| Other items                                     | 287      | (278)    | n.a.   |\n| Interest expense, net                           | 1,384    | (563)    | n.a.   |\n| Paid tax                                        | (2,717)  | (1,263)  | 115 %  |\n| Change in work in progress                      | (722)    | 4,271    | n.a.   |\n| Change in tax equity partner liabilities        | 374      | (353)    | n.a.   |\n| Change in other working capital                 | 4,226    | (440)    | n.a.   |\n| Gross investments                               | (38,509) | (37,447) | 3 %    |\n| Divestments                                     | 1,542    | 25,636   | (94 %) |\n| Free cash flow                                  | (8,435)  | 113      | n.a.   |\n| Net interest-bearing debt at 1 January          | 30,571   | 24,280   | 26 %   |\n| Free cash flow                                  | 8,435    | (113)    | n.a.   |\n| Dividends and hybrid coupons paid               | 6,613    | 6,052    | 9 %    |\n| Addition of leasing obligations, net            | 978      | 1,598    | (39 %) |\n| Repurchase of hybrid capital, net               | 699      | (1,747)  | n.a.   |\n| Exchange rate adjustments, etc.                 | 83       | 501      | (83 %) |\n| Net interest-bearing debt at 31 December        | 47,379   | 30,571   | 55 %   |\n\nGain (loss) on sale of assets is part of EBITDA but is presented as part of the 'divestment' cash flow.

        "page_content": "In 2023, 'Divestments' amounted to DKK 1.5 billion and was related to our divestment of London Array and our 50 % farm-down of Gode Wind 3 and to our acquisition of Eversource's 50 % ownership share of Lease Area 500 and PSEG's 25 % equity stake in Ocean Wind 1, both in the US. As the two US acquisitions are with non-controlling shareholders, they are not included in 'Gross investments' but as part of 'Divestments'. In 2022, divestments amounted to DKK 25.6 billion and were mainly related to the 50 % farmdowns of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3.\n\n## Interest-bearing net debt\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 47.4 billion at the end of 2023 against DKK 30.6 billion at the end of 2022. The increase was mainly due to dividend payments of DKK 6.6 billion and a negative free cash flow of DKK 8.4 billion.\n\n## Equity and capital employed\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity was DKK 77.8 billion at the end of 2023 against DKK 95.5 billion at the end of 2022. The change in equity was primarily due to the impairment losses of DKK 25.4 billion, net of tax, and cancellation fees of DKK 9.6 billion, whereas the post-tax hedging and currency translation reserve increased by DKK 16.2 billion to DKK -10.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\n## Capital employed\n\nCapital employed was DKK 125.2 billion at the end of 2023 against DKK 126.1 billion at the end of 2022,\n\nwith impairment losses and cancellation fees more or less offseting new investments.\n\n## Financial ratios\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) was -14.2 % in 2023. The decrease of 31 percentage points compared to last year was attributable to a lower EBIT due to the impairment losses and cancellation fees. ROCE adjusted for impairment losses and cancellation fees in 2023 was 12.9 %.\n\n## Credit metric (FFO/adjusted net debt)\n\nThe funds from operations (FFO)/adjusted net debt credit metric was 28.6 % in 2023 against 42.7 % in 2022. The decrease was due to lower FFO and higher NIBD.\n\n## ESG results\n\n## Renewable share of heat and power generation\n\nThe renewable share of heat and power generation amounted to 93 % in 2023, 2 percentage points higher than last year. The increase was primarily due to an increased share of offshore wind generation.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nOur greenhouse gas emissions from heat and power generation (scope 1 and 2) decreased by 37 % compared to 2022 to 1.6 million tonnes in 2023. This was primarily due to the decrease in the use of coal at our CHP plants.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain and sales activities (scope 3) were 49 % lower than in 2022, primarily due to a 47 % reduction in natural gas sales, lower emissions related to capital goods as we only commissioned four onshore sites in 2023, and lower emissions related to transport of fuels and sale of power.\n\nOur scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity decreased to 38 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2023 against 60 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2022. The decrease was a result of a 37 % decrease in scope 1 and 2 emissions (numerator) in combination with a nearly unchanged total heat and power generation (denominator).\n\nOur scope 1-3 greenhouse gas intensity (excluding natural gas sales) decreased to 80 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2023 against 147 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2022. The decrease was a result of the lower scope 1 emissions and lower emissions related to capital goods, fuels, and power sales (numerator) in combination with an unchanged total heat and power generation (denominator).\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2023, we had 73 total recordable injuries (TRIs), of which 50 injuries were related to contractors' employees. In total, this was a decrease of five injuries compared to 2022. The number of hours worked was 25.8 million hours, an increase of 4 % compared to 2022. The total recordable injury rate (TRIR) decreased to 2.8 in 2023 from 3.1 in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned KPIs\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned share of revenue was 86 %, EBITDA was 95 %, gross investments was 99 %, and OPEX was 79 % in 2023.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned part of revenue increased by 17 percentage points due to a substantial decline in revenue from our noneligible natural gas and power sales activities.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned part of EBITDA increased by 10 percentage points due to a substantial decline in earnings from our noneligible natural gas sales and fossil-based CHP generation activities.\n\nRead more about our EU taxonomy-aligned KPIs in the environment section in our sustainability statements for 2023.\n\n## Revenue  86 %\n\nEBITDA  95 %\n\nGross investments  99 %\n\nOPEX  79 %",

In Q4 2023, the decision to cease development of Ocean Wind 1 led to cancellation fees of DKK 9.6 billion. Furthermore, we farmed down 50 % of Gode Wind 3. Adjusted for new partnerships and cancellation fees, EBITDA was DKK 2.0 billion above Q4 2022 and amounted to DKK 8.6 billion.\n\nEarnings from Offshore sites amounted to DKK 7.2 billion, an increase of DKK 3.4 billion compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to higher wind speeds, ramp-up of generation from Greater Changhua 1 and 2a, lower BSUoS and balancing costs, and a significant negative impact from hedges in Q4 2022 which was not repeated in Q4 2023. This was only partly offset by the divestment of London Array.\n\nEBITDA from existing partnerships increased by DKK 1.4 billion and amounted to DKK 0.4 billion in Q4 2023, mainly related to adjustment of wake and warranty provisions. In Q4 2022, we had negative earnings due to delays with commissioning of the wind turbines at Greater Changhua 1 and higher costs for the project, which reduced earnings under the construction agreement.\n\nEBITDA from our Onshore business amounted to DKK 0.5 billion and was DKK 0.3 billion lower than in Q4 2022. Ramp-up of generation from new assets was more than offset by lower availability and significantly lower prices in Q4 2023.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants amounted to DKK 0.8 billion in Q4 2023, a decrease of DKK 0.9 billion compared to the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to very high power prices and favourable spreads for power condensing generation in Q4 2022, which were not repeated this year. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by accounting FIFO effects. The negative impacts were partly offset by a compensation from Energinet related to their order in 2022 when we had to continue or resume operations of three power station units.\n\nEBITDA from our gas business totalled DKK 0.6 billion in Q4 2023, DKK 1.5 billion lower than in the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a lower positive effect from gas at storage in Q4 2023 than in Q4 2022, and the release of a provision in Q4 2022 related to the close-down of our B2B business in the UK.\n\nEBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| DKKm                                                | Q4 2023   | Q4 2022   | %       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Revenue                                             | 21,530    | 30,256    | (29 %)  |\n| EBITDA                                              | (686)     | 6,696     | n.a.    |\n| New partnerships                                    | 317       | 77        | 312 %   |\n| Cancellation fees                                   | (9,621)   | -         | n.a.    |\n| EBITDA excl. new partnerships and cancellation fees | 8,618     | 6,619     | 30 %    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                       | (2,366)   | (2,792)   | (15 %)  |\n| Impairment loss                                     | 1,647     | (2,529)   | n.a.    |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)                      | (1,405)   | 1,375     | n.a.    |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises            | (44)      | 32        | n.a.    |\n| Financial items, net                                | 2,001     | (985)     | n.a.    |\n| Profit (loss) before tax                            | 557       | 460       | 21 %    |\n| Tax                                                 | (841)     | (789)     | 7 %     |\n| Tax rate                                            | 151 %     | 172 %     | (21 %p) |\n| Profit (loss) for the period                        | (284)     | (329)     | (14 %)  |",

In Q4 2022, we had a net cash inflow of DKK 1.8 billion, mainly related to milestone payments at Greater Changhua 1 and Borkum  Riffgrund 3.\n\nIn Q4 2023, we did not receive any significant tax equity contributions, while we received tax equity contribution for phase 1 of Old 300 in Q4 2022.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 13.0 billion in Q4 2023. The main investments were:\n\n- \u00b7 offshore wind farms (DKK 9.7 billion), including Greater Changhua 2b and 4 in Taiwan, our portfolio of US and German projects, and Hornsea 3\n- \u00b7 onshore wind and solar farms (DKK 3.0 billion), including the construction of Eleven Mile, Mockingbird, the solar part of Helena Energy Center, and our portfolio of European projects.\n\nIn Q4 2023, divestments amounted to DKK 1.9 billion and were mainly related to the 50 % farm-down of Gode Wind 3.",

        "page_content": "## Offshore\n\nFinancial results for Q4 2023\n\nPower generation increased by 11 % to 6.0 TWh in Q4 2023. The increase was due to higher wind speeds and ramp-up at Greater Changhua 1 and 2a. This was only partly offset by lower availability.\n\nWind speeds amounted to a portfolio average of 11.5 m/s, which was higher than in Q4 2022 (10.7 m/s) and slightly higher than the normal wind speeds expected in the fourth quarter (11.4 m/s).\n\nAvailability ended at 92 %, which was 3 percentage points lower than in the same period last year. This was mainly due to scheduled outages and component replacements at Walney Extension and Gode Wind 1.\n\nRevenue decreased by 18 % and amounted to DKK 16.1 billion.\n\nRevenue from offshore wind farms in operation decreased by 22 % to DKK 8.4 billion, mainly driven by lower prices. Revenue from power sales decreased by 14 % to DKK 6.8 billion, due to significantly lower power prices and lower volumes sold.\n\nEBITDA decreased by DKK 4.7 billion and amounted to DKK -2.6 billion.\n\nEBITDA from 'Sites, O&M, and PPAs' increased by DKK 3.4 billion and amounted to DKK 7.2 billion in Q4 2023. The increase was due to higher wind speeds\n\n(DKK 0.2 billion), ramp-up of generation at Greater Changhua 1 and 2a, lower balancing and BSUoS costs, and a neutral effect from hedges in Q4 2023 vs a large negative contribution from hedges in Q4 2022. This was only partly offset by the divestment of London Array in Q3 2023.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK 0.7 billion in Q4 2023 and mainly related to the farm-down of Gode Wind 3 and minor changes in our wake and warranty provisions. In Q4 2022, we had negative earnings due to delays with commissioning of the wind turbines at Greater Changhua 1 and higher costs for the project, which reduced earnings under the construction agreement.\n\nEBITDA was negatively impacted by DKK 9.6 billion from cancellation fees related to our decision to cease the development of the Ocean Wind 1 project.\n\nEBITDA from other activities, including project development, amounted to DKK -0.8 billion, slightly lower than Q4 2022.\n\n| Results                                        | Q4 2023       | Q4 2022         | %         | 2023              | 2022           | %          |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Business drivers                               |               |                 |           |                   |                |            |\n| Decided (FID'ed) and installed                 |               |                 |           |                   |                |            |\n| capacity, GW                                   | 15.5          | 11.1            | 40 %      | 15.5              | 11.1           | 40 %       |\n| Installed capacity, GW                         | 8.9           | 8.9             | 0 %       | 8.9               | 8.9            | 0 %        |\n| Generation capacity, GW                        | 5.0           | 4.7             | 7 %       | 5.0               | 4.7            | 7 %        |\n| Wind speed, m/s                                | 11.5          | 10.7            | 7 %       | 9.8               | 9.5            | 3 %        |\n| Load factor, %                                 | 56            | 54              | 2 %p      | 43                | 42             | 1 %p       |\n| Availability, %                                | 92            | 95              | (3 %p)    | 93                | 94             | (1 %p)     |\n| Power generation, GWh                          | 6,011         | 5,411           | 11 %      | 17,761            | 16,483         | 8 %        |\n| Denmark                                        | 623           | 634             | (2 %)     | 1,970             | 2,084          | (5 %)      |\n| The United Kingdom                             | 3,434         | 3,631           | (5 %)     | 10,887            | 10,989         | (1 %)      |\n| Germany                                        | 733           | 626             | 17 %      | 2,076             | 1,949          | 7 %        |\n| The Netherlands                                | 490           | 401             | 22 %      | 1,449             | 1,259          | 15 %       |\n| APAC                                           | 705           | 85              | 729 %     | 1,291             | 92             | 1,303 %    |\n| The US                                         | 26            | 34              | (24 %)    | 88                | 110            | (20 %)     |\n| Power sales, GWh                               | 6,244         | 7,645           | (18 %)    | 21,448            | 23,194         | (8 %)      |\n| Power price, LEBA UK                           | 117           | 210             | (44 %)    | 116               | 252            | (54 %)     |\n| British pound                                  | 8.6           | 8.6             | 1 %       | 8.6               | 8.7            | (2 %)      |\n| Financial performance, DKKm                    |               |                 |           |                   |                |            |\n| Revenue                                        | 16,058        | 19,499          | (18 %)    | 58,427            | 69,261         | (16 %)     |\n| Sites, O&M, and PPAs                           | 8,425         | 10,767          | (22 %)    | 23,304            | 23,349         | (0 %)      |\n| Power sales                                    | 6,729         | 7,787           | (14 %)    | 27,495            | 34,142         | (19 %)     |\n| Construction agreements                        | 784           | 916             | (14 %)    | 6,589             | 11,640         | (43 %)     |\n| Other                                          | 120           | 30              | 300 %     | 1,039             | 131            | 693 %      |\n| EBITDA                                         | (2,611)       | 2,094           | n.a.      | 13,817            | 19,569         | (29 %)     |\n| Sites, O&M, and PPAs                           | 7,164         | 3,746           | 91 %      | 20,207            | 9,940          | 103 %      |\n| Construction agreements   and divestment gains | 676           | (715)           | n.a.      | 5,218             | 12,277         | (57 %)     |\n| Cancellation fees                              | (9,621)       | -

The decrease was due to lower availability and lower wind speeds, partly offset by ramp-up of generation at Sunflower Wind. The availability in the US was lower, mainly due to Western Trail going offline in August because of an unplanned transmission line outage. Western Trail was back online in the middle of December.\n\nRevenue decreased by 21 % compared to Q4 2022 and amounted to DKK 0.6 billion. The decrease was mainly due to lower prices across the portfolio and a 5 % lower USD rate than in Q4 2022.\n\nEBITDA for Q4 2023 amounted to DKK 0.5 billion, which was DKK 0.3 billion lower than Q4 2022. The decrease was due to high earnings in Q4 2022, when we benefitted from the higher power prices in Ireland and the US. In the US, the effect was mostly from ramp-up generation from assets under construction (PPAs do not start until COD). Furthermore, some of our PPAs have upside sharing structures, which allow for capture of additional revenue in periods of high pricing compared to traditional PPAs.\n\nIn 2023, we have reclassified costs related to our operating assets from 'Other including project development' to 'Sites' to align with our methodology in Offshore (no impact on total Onshore EBITDA).\n\n| Results                                        | Q4 2023   | Q4 2022   | %      | 2023    | 2022     | %      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Business drivers                               |           |           |        |         |          |        |\n| Decided (FID'ed) and installed capac- i ty, GW | 6.4       | 6.2       | 2 %    | 6.4     | 6.2      | 2 %    |\n| Installed capacity, GW                         | 4.8       | 4.2       | 15 %   | 4.8     | 4.2      | 15 %   |\n| Wind speed, m/s                                | 7.6       | 7.7       | (1 %)  | 7.2     | 7.4      | (3 %)  |\n| Load factor, wind, %                           | 36        | 40        | (4 %p) | 36      | 40       | (4 %p) |\n| Load factor, solar PV, %                       | 17        | 17        | 0 %p   | 24      | 25       | (1 %p) |\n| Availability, wind, %                          | 85        | 91        | (6 %p) | 88      | 93       | (5 %p) |\n| Availability, solar PV, %                      | 98        | 99        | (1 %p) | 98      | 98       | 0 %p   |\n| Power generation, GWh                          | 3,376     | 3,425     | (1 %)  | 13,374  | 13,146   | 2 %    |\n| US wind                                        | 2,640     | 2,711     | (3 %)  | 10,124  | 10,389   | (3 %)  |\n| US solar PV                                    | 391       | 388       | 1 %    | 2,131   | 1,920    | 11 %   |\n| Europe, wind and solar PV                      | 344       | 326       | 6 %    | 1,119   | 837      | 34 %   |\n| US dollar                                      | 6.9       | 7.3       | (5 %)  | 6.9     | 7.1      | (3 %)  |\n| Financial performance, DKKm                    |           |           |        |         |          |        |\n| Revenue                                        | 598       | 758       | (21 %) | 2,620   | 3,014    | (13 %) |\n| EBITDA                                         | 525       | 852       | (38 %) | 2,970   | 3,644    | (18 %) |\n| Sites                                          | 394       | 420       | (6 %)  | 1,256   | 2,097    | (40 %) |\n| Tax credits and tax attributes                 | 590       | 712       | (17 %) | 2,567   | 2,556    | 0 %    |\n| Other, including project development           | (460)     | (280)     | 64 %   | (854)   | (1,009)  | (15 %) |\n| Depreciation                                   | (498)     | (448)     | 11 %   | (1,957) | (1,644)  | 19 %   |\n| Impairment losses                              | 507       | -         | n.a.   | (927)   | -        | n.a.   |\n| EBIT                                           | 534       | 404       | 32 %   | 86      | 2,000    | (96 %) |\n| Cash flow from operating activities            | (11)      | 1,039     | n.a.   | 609     | 2,509    | (76 %) |\n| Gross investments                              | (3,024)   | (1,856)   | 63 %   | (9,069) | (10,396) | (13 %) |\n| Divestments                                    | 3         | 13        | (79 %) | 5       | 56       | (91 %) |\n| Free cash flow                                 | (3,032)   | (804)     | 277 %  | (8,455) | (7,831)  | 8 %    |\n| Capital employed                               | 35,634    | 28,463    | 25 %   | 35,634  | 28,463   | 25 %   |",

The decrease was driven by significantly lower gas and power sales, lower power generation, and lower prices.\n\nEBITDA amounted to DKK 1.4 billion compared to DKK 3.6 billion in Q4 2022.\n\nEBITDA from 'CHP plants' was DKK 0.8 billion, DKK 0.9 billion lower than in Q4 2022. This was due to the lower generation and market-based spreads mentioned above. In addition, earnings from power generation were negatively impacted by the high costs of biomass and coal relative to the market prices in Q4 2023 as the cost is measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. The fuel we have been using during Q4 2023 was bought last year at the higher price levels. The opposite was the case in Q4 2022. The negative impacts were partly offset by a compensation from Energinet related to their order in 2022 when we had to continue or resume operations of three power station units until June 2024.\n\nEBITDA from 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' decreased by DKK 1.5 billion relative to Q4 2022 to DKK 0.6 billion. The decrease was driven by a lower positive effect from gas at storage in Q4 2023 than in Q4 2022 and the release of a provision in Q4 2022 related to the close-down of our B2B business in the UK.\n\n| Results                             | Q4 2023   | Q4 2022   | %       | 2023   | 2022   | %      |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Business drivers                    |           |           |         |        |        |        |\n| Degree days                         | 966       | 861       | 12 %    | 2,585  | 2,548  | 1 %    |\n| Heat generation, GWh                | 2,385     | 2,064     | 16 %    | 6,587  | 6,368  | 3 %    |\n| Power generation, GWh               | 1,042     | 1,409     | (26 %)  | 4,437  | 6,012  | (26 %) |\n| Gas sales, GWh                      | 3,041     | 4,048     | (25 %)  | 16,880 | 31,637 | (47 %) |\n| Power sales, GWh                    | 628       | 904       | (31 %)  | 2,627  | 5,399  | (51 %) |\n| Gas price, TTF, EUR/MWh             | 43.3      | 94.4      | (54 %)  | 41.4   | 120.5  | (66 %) |\n| Power price, DK, EUR/MWh            | 91.1      | 176.2     | (48 %)  | 89.3   | 213.7  | (58 %) |\n| Green dark spread, DK, EUR/MWh      | (5.4)     | 23.3      | n.a.    | (25.8) | 39.5   | n.a.   |\n| Wood pellet spread, DK, EUR/MWh     | (0.5)     | (6.2)     | (92 %)  | 4.3    | 54.4   | (92 %) |\n| Financial performance, DKKm         |           |           |         |        |        |        |\n| Revenue                             | 5,235     | 10,251    | (49 %)  | 19,230 | 46,243 | (58 %) |\n| EBITDA                              | 1,434     | 3,609     | (60 %)  | 1,523  | 8,619  | (82 %) |\n| CHP plants                          | 836       | 1,718     | (51 %)  | 1,218  | 5,851  | (79 %) |\n| Gas Markets & Infrastructure        | 589       | 2,073     | (72 %)  | 558    | 3,117  | (82 %) |\n| Other, incl. project development    | 9         | (182)     | n.a.    | (253)  | (349)  | (28 %) |\n| Depreciation                        | (180)     | (287)     | (37 %)  | (759)  | (859)  | (12 %) |\n| Impairment losses                   | (322)     | -         | n.a.    | (322)  | -      | n.a.   |\n| EBIT                                | 932       | 3,322     | (72 %)  | 442    | 7,760  | (94 %) |\n| Cash flow from operating activities | 358       | 738       | (51 %)  | 2,550  | 2,622  | (3 %)  |\n| Gross investments                   | (374)     | (25)      | 1,396 % | (727)  | (267)  | 172 %  |\n| Divestments                         | 64        | (4)       | n.a.    | 61     | (4)    | n.a.   |\n| Free cash flow                      | 48        | 709       | (93 %)  | 1,884  | 2,351  | (20 %) |\n| Capital employed                    | 4,655     | 5,211     | (11 %)  | 4,655  | 5,211  | (11 %) |",

        "page_content": "## Governance framework\n\nThe overall and strategic management of the company is anchored in a board of non-executive directors.\n\nAs a publicly listed company, \u00d8rsted shall provide a statement on how we address the recommendations on Corporate Governance issued by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. Our statement can be found (here). In 2023, we decided not to webcast our annual general meeting and therefore only partly complied with Recommendation 1.2.1 as accounted for in our 2023 corporate governance statement. Besides this, we comply with all recommendations. Going forward, we have decided to webcast general meetings.\n\n## Shareholders and general meetings\n\nThe Danish State is our majority shareholder with a 50.1 % ownership share. The Danish State exercises its ownership interest in \u00d8rsted in accordance with the ordinary governance setup in Danish companies. The Danish State's ownership policy (only in Danish) is available on: fm.dk/udgivelser/2015/april/ statens-ejerskabspolitik/.\n\nThe shareholders of \u00d8rsted exercise their right to vote at the general meeting through a one-share-one-vote principle. The general meeting adopts decisions in accordance with the ordinary Danish rules. Due to our majority ownership by the Danish State, we have a bespoke quorum requirement, as proposals to amend\n\nour articles of association or dissolve the company require that the Danish State participates in the general meeting and supports the proposals.\n\nThe general meeting appoints a board of non-executive directors (the Board of Directors), who, together with the executive directors appointed by the board, are responsible for the management of the company.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of the Directors is, together with the executive directors appointed by the board, responsible for the management of the company.\n\nIn 2022, our general meeting approved to expand our scheme for employee-elected board members to cover employees globally, and we will hold our first international election in Q1 2024. Our Board of Directors currently comprises twelve members, eight members elected by the general meeting and four members elected by the employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the overall strategic management of the company. The Board of Directors lays down the company's strategy and makes decisions concerning major investments and divestments, the capital base, key policies, control and audit matters, risk management, and significant operational issues. You can see the most important tasks in 2023 on the next page.\n\nThe Board of Directors monitors and oversees progress related to our sustainability strategy and that our sustainability targets are achieved, including our ambitious net-zero carbon reduction targets for scope 1-3 emissions. ESG and sustainability priorities are an integral part of the decision-making governance of the Board of Directors, and an update on our sustainability targets and progress is presented to them annually.\n\nThe Board of Directors annually reviews the required competences for its composition. In 2023, the ESG competence was further detailed to bring it in line with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The list of required competences can be found on orsted.com/competences-overview.\n\nWe have a diverse Board of Directors. With three female board members out of the eight elected by the general meeting, we have a 37.5 % female representation, which is an equal representation under Danish law.\n\nThe age of our board members spans from 48 to 69 years old among board members elected by the general meeting and from 29 to 56 years old among board members elected by the employees. Our board members have different educational backgrounds within finance, economics, geophysics, and engineering and professional experience from the energy or other industries, private equity, private investments, and academia.

Their meeting attendance during 2023 can be found above.\n\nThe Board of Directors evaluates its performance annually. The 2023 board evaluation was conducted by distributing a customised online survey to all members of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team, and findings were subsequently discussed at a board meeting. The overall score was satisfactory, although slightly lower than 2022. In 2022, the Board of Directors identified two overriding themes regarding the division of responsibilities between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board and the information to the Board of Directors regarding talent\n\nmanagement and succession. Since the evaluation, various initiatives have been launched to address the findings, and in the 2023 board evaluation, the general feedback was that progress had been made.\n\nThe general meeting determines the remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors for the financial year in which the general meeting is held.

The tasks of the committee include overseeing the integrity of the financial and sustainability reporting (including key accounting estimates and judgements), funding, liquidity and capital structure development, financial and business-related risks, compliance with statutory and other requirements from public authorities, internal controls, nomination of external auditors, and IT security in operational and administrative areas as well as cybersecurity. Moreover, the committee approves the framework governing the work of the company's external and internal auditors (including limits for non-audit services), evaluates the external auditors' independence and qualifications, and monitors the company's whistleblower scheme.\n\nIn 2023, the committee reviewed impairments on our property, plant, and equipment with a high attention to our US offshore wind projects, the development and partial implementation of a new, holistic risk management framework addressing lessons learnt in current and previous years, and prepared for the EU Corporate\n\nSustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Furthermore, the committee conducted an audit tender with effect from 2025, continued to assess the claim made by the Danish Tax Agency requiring double Danish taxation of certain of our British offshore wind farms, and lastly, reviewed the progress in IT security.\n\nOur Internal Audit function reports to the committee and is independent of our administrative management structures. Internal Audit enhances and protects the organisational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. The focus for Internal Audit is to audit and advise on our core processes, governance, risk management, control processes, and IT security.\n\nThe Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for managing our whistleblower scheme. Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistleblower scheme or through our management system. In 2023, 18 substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistleblower scheme. Nine cases related to good business conduct policy violations, while six cases concerned the workplace environment, one case concerned IT security, and two cases were classified as 'other'. None of the reported cases were critical to our business, nor caused adjustments to our financial results. One case required a police report.\n\nWhistleblower cases are taken very seriously, and we continuously enhance the awareness of good business conduct through education and awareness campaigns to minimise future similar cases.\n\nYou can read more about the Audit & Risk  Committee and the terms of reference for the committee on orsted.com/audit-risk-committee.\n\n## Nomination & Remuneration Committee\n\nThomas Thune Andersen (Chair), Lene Skole, and Julia King are the members of the committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in matters regarding the composition, remuneration, and performance of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team.\n\nIn 2023, the committee discussed the need for replacing the CFO and COO, including the appointment of an interim CFO and interim COO, and the appointment of Varun Sivaram as a new member of the Group Executive Team, replacing Neil O'Donovan.\n\nThe committee also reviewed an amendment of the short-term incentive scheme (STI) for the wider management team by implementing similar changes as the amendment introduced in 2022 for the  Executive Board where the weight of shared KPIs was increased, including an explicit link to our sustainability ambitions.\n\nYou can read more about the Nomination & Remuneration Committee and the terms of reference for the committee on orsted.com/ nomination-remuneration-committee.",

Andrew Brown was appointed interim COO, expectedly until end of March 2024. While he has taken on the dual role as board member and interim COO, measures have been put in place to avoid conflicts of interests.\n\nMads Nipper (Group President and CEO), Rasmus Errboe (interim CFO), and Henriette Fenger Ellekrog (CHRO) constitute the members of the Executive Board of \u00d8rsted A/S.\n\nThe Executive Board has established a Group Executive Team consisting of ten members, including the members of the Executive Board, which undertake the day-to-day management.\n\nThe Group Executive Team comprises David Hardy (CEO of Region Americas), Per Mejnert Kristensen (President of Region APAC), Olivia Breese (interim CEO of Region Europe and Head of P2X), Andrew Brown (interim COO), Varun Sivaram (Head of Strategy, Innovation, Portfolio & Partnerships), Ingrid Reumert (Head of Global Stakeholder Relations), and Anders Zo\u00ebga Hansen (Head of Legal).\n\nIn our Executive Board, we have a female representation of 33.3 %.

Moreover, they present proposals for sustainability targets to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n## Internal controls environment\n\nWe have established internal control systems throughout the organisation to ensure identification and mitigation of risks to financial and sustainability reporting by setting up targets, policies, manuals, procedures, and internal controls. We continuously monitor our financial and sustainability reporting processes and controls and optimise them as needed.\n\nWe carry out an annual risk assessment for  identifying the risks of material misstatements in the financial and sustainability reporting based on materiality, the complexity of processes, and the probability of errors and omissions.\n\nTo ensure that our internal control framework is effective, we have established a plan running until the end of 2024 where we will evaluate the processes for all material areas within financial and sustainability reporting, including reassessment of existing controls and identification of additional controls within the processes. We continuously monitor and test the internal controls on financial and sustainability reporting to ensure their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe have established the same governance for financial and sustainability reporting. The Audit & Risk Committee monitors our financial and sustainability reporting process, including a review of the risk assessment, the internal controls, and their operating effectiveness.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring the accuracy of our financial and sustainability reporting. Our financial reporting are audited by an independent audit firm elected at the annual general meeting. Our sustainability data is subject to limited assurance by the same independent auditor.

In addition to the CFO, the committee consists of the Chief Risk Officer and the heads of Internal Audit, Merchant Risk, and the US and European Trading & Revenue functions.

The Sustainability Committee is chaired by the CFO and meets six times a year.\n\n## QHSE Committee\n\nThe committee oversees that we live up to our QHSE (quality, health, safety, and environment) priorities, and it reviews our QHSE strategy and policy.

        "page_content": "## Preparing for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\nWe welcome the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the underlying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We believe that this EU directive and the standards will not only ensure a more balanced, transparent, and consistent disclosure of sustainability information, but also catalyse strengthened sustainability governance and management.\n\n## Reporting on sustainable finance\n\nIn 2015, the responsibility of ESG accounting and reporting was moved to our financial organisation to ensure that our ESG accounting, controlling, and reporting teams work in alignment with our financial teams when it comes to processes, deadlines, tools, documentation templates, and reporting products. Furthermore, the teams work in close collaboration with our Global Sustainability team. This reporting set-up has brought us to a position where we are well suited to implement the new EU CSRD and underlying reporting standards.\n\nIn spring 2022, our Sustainability Committee initiated an ESG development project with the aim of preparing us for the new sustainable finance reporting requirements, including the CSRD, PAI indicators for our investors, and reasonable assurance for our ESG reporting.\n\n## New sustainability statements\n\nReporting on the CSRD in 2024 is a huge task. Therefore, we have decided to front-load the work by developing new sustainability statements for the annual report 2023. The sustainability statements are prepared with reference to the ESRS. Our aim has been to implement as much of the fundamental structure in the standards as possible in 2023, and to integrate it in the best way possible with the other parts of our annual report. We have done this by using the 'incorporation by reference' option. You can find a full overview of the ESRS structure and where to find the different disclosures in the section 'Disclosure requirements and incorporation by reference' in the appendix.\n\nOur double materiality assessment (DMA) has been performed with reference to the draft ESRS from November 2022, with some choices to limit the complete DMA scope (see DMA outcome on page 71). We will continue the development of the DMA towards full CSRD compliance in 2024.\n\nIn our previous ESG performance reports, we have reported on a set of energy-related \u00d8rsted- specific data points, which are not included in the ESRS. We have included these data points in section E1 on climate change in the sustainability statements and\n\nregard this data as material entity-specific information this year. We expect some of the data points to be included in future sector-specific additions to the ESRS.\n\nA few data points from our previous ESG performance reports have been assessed to be below the DMA materiality thresholds. We have made these data points available in the appendix, as they are asked for by certain ESG ratings and stakeholders.\n\n## We wish you a pleasant reading!\n\nWe are very happy and proud to present our new sustainability statements. We believe they are a valueadding addition to our annual report, and we hope that you find them easy to navigate and interesting to read - and that you will find the sustainability information you are looking for.\n\n## Rasmus Errboe\n\nInterim CFO\n\nHead of the Sustainability Committee\n\n2006\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2024\n\n## Our ESG reporting timeline\n\n\u00d8rsted's first stand-alone sustainability report\n\nResponsibility of ESG accounting and reporting was moved to finance\n\nWe implemented our ESG reporting in the financial reporting processes, tools, and reports.\n\nFirst annual ESG performance report\n\nWe published our first annual ESG performance report built on the financial reporting platform.\n\nFirst interim ESG performance report\n\nIn Q1 2019, we published our first interim ESG performance report. Since 2019, we have published interim ESG performance reports every quarter together with the financial interim reports.\n\nPre-implementation of the taxonomy reporting\n\nIn our interim report for H1 2021, we published our first EU taxonomy reporting and included a voluntary EBITDA taxonomy indicator in addition to the mandatory taxonomy reporting indicators.\n\nNew sustainability statements in the annual report 2023\n\nWe merged content from three standalone reports from 2022 into the sustainability statements.\n\nFull implementation of the CSRD in the sustainability statements",

Throughout everything we do, we are guided by how and where we can create the most value for both society and our business.\n\nWe have four strategic sustainability focus areas climate, nature, people, and governance - each with underlying priorities. Together, the four areas respond to our material sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities. And they support our efforts to deliver a fast build-out at scale that works for both the planet and people while laying the foundation for a resilient business.\n\nOn the following pages, we unfold how we identify impacts and risks through a double materiality assessment.

All the data points included in the E, S, and G sections have been assessed as material according to our double materiality assessment (DMA). Please see the pages below for information on our DMA's limitations to scope and our methodology. All greenhouse gas data points (GHG scope 1-3) are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently in the financial year and for comparative figures. Calculation factors used are listed in the appendix together with references.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe data is consolidated according to the same principles as the financial statements. Thus, the consolidated quantitative ESG data comprises the parent company \u00d8rsted A/S and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. Joint operations are also included with \u00d8rsted's proportionate share. Associates and joint ventures are not included in the consolidated ESG data points.\n\nConsolidation of all quantitative ESG data follows the principles above, unless otherwise specified in the accounting policy placed next to each reported data point in the tables in sections E, S, and G.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nWe use assessments and estimates for the reporting of some data points, e.g. our taxonomy KPIs and scope 3 emissions. We regularly reassess our use of estimates and judgements based on experience, the development of ESG reporting, and a number of other factors. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate in question is revised. In addition, we make judgements when we apply the accounting policies. For further information on the key estimates, judgements, and assumptions applied, please refer to the pages with quantitative ESG data tables.\n\n## Threshold for restatements\n\nFor adjustments to financial numbers, we follow the financial statements. For adjustments to ESG data, we make a judgement as to whether we should restate numbers. We clearly indicate where we have restated data.\n\n## External review\n\nAll quantitative data points in the tables in sections E, S, G, and in the appendix marked with a blue eye icon ( ), are covered by the ESG review (limited assurance) performed by our auditor PwC. Please see the auditor's limited assurance report on page 249.\n\n## How to read the sustainability statements\n\nOur management report consists of two parts: the management's review and the sustainability statements. The latter reports on some disclosure requirements from the ESRS. However, our actual reporting on data and information is not yet aligned with the CSRD and the underlying ESRS requirements. Our sustainability statements are structured into four overall sections: 'General', ' Environment', 'Social', and 'Governance'.\n\nWe have chosen to incorporate some of the strategy and corporate governance disclosures from the cross-cutting standard ESRS 2 in the management's review as we believe this information is best read in close connection with the financial review and overview of our activities.\n\nInformation on where in the annual report we have reported on ESRS disclosure requirements can be found on page 132.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This approach has previously used two dimensions to assess materiality: (1) 'stakeholder importance', which represented impacts to our surroundings, and (2) 'strategic importance', which represented impacts on our business from the outside.\n\nWe have conducted our first DMA this year to capture learnings that will help us to improve our methodology next year. We applied the limited guidance available from EFRAG, combined with our own interpretation of the standards, and developed a step-by-step process, scoring matrices, and a model for aggregation and prioritisation.\n\nOur starting point was the impact assessment (insideout) of \u00d8rsted's impacts on the environment and society, which builds on how we have previously identified and assessed the sustainability-related impacts of our own operations and value chain. We have also conducted a financial assessment (outside-in) of the sustainabilityrelated risks we are exposed to as a business.\n\nWhere possible, we quantified the effects of those matters and supplemented with qualitative assessments.\n\nDue to our previous work with assessing sustainabilityrelated impacts and the complexity in quantifying sustainability-related risks to our business, our efforts this year were concentrated mostly on the impact assessment.\n\nAs the ESRS principles on double materiality and assessment requirements are extensive, we decided to limit the number and groups of stakeholders involved in assessing our sustainability-related impacts and risks to internal subject-matter experts only.\n\nTo verify and calibrate the results of our new DMA, we also performed a light update of our former materiality assessment using the approach we have taken annually since 2013. This assessment served as a proxy for direct involvement of external stakeholders in the DMA as it informs us about the interests and views of stakeholders relevant to our business.\n\nIn 2024, we will further refine our DMA process and methodology based on the final ESRS and guidance.\n\nWe are convinced that the outcome presented below is a true and fair picture of our impacts and risks, but we also acknowledge that our methodology has limitations. Consequently, we will be further developing our DMA based on the final implementation guidance published by EFRAG in 2024.\n\nThe following pages provide detailed information on the results of our double materiality assessment and the process we have applied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more\n\nMatrix showing our material and immaterial ESRS topics. \u2192  Page 71\n\nOur value chain and interaction with our most material impacts and risks.\n\n- \u2192  Page 72\n\nTables specifying all our material impacts and risks.\n\n- \u2192  Pages 73-76\n\nDescription of methodologies, assumptions, and process steps.\n\n- \u2192  Pages 77-78\n\nInterests and views of stakeholders.\n\n- \u2192  Page 79\n- Topical sections specifying our response to our material impacts and risks, including policies, actions, targets and metrics.\n- \u2192  Pages 87-130",

The outcome is aggregated per ESRS topic, showing that E1, E5, S3, and S2 are our most material sustainability matters.\n\nThe environmental impacts and risks we have within E1 and E5 are closely linked to our strategic efforts to deliver a fast build-out of renewable energy. The deployment of new renewable capacity mitigates climate impacts but also requires significant amounts of natural resources such as steel with indirect negative impacts on the climate and the environment.\n\nThe build-out also affects people and societies, which is reflected in the impacts and risks we have within S2 and S3. We focus our efforts on making the energy transition just and inclusive, including for people working across the renewable energy supply chains, and in a way that brings benefits to local communities.\n\n## Read more\n\nThe next page illustrates where our material impacts (crucial) and our material risks occur across our full value chain. Brief descriptions of our material impacts and risks are included on the pages that follow.\n\nMore information on how we respond to the effects of our impacts and risks can be found within the 'Environment', 'Social', and 'Governance' sections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignificant\n\n| FINANCIALLY   MATERIAL TOPICS                                                   | IMPACT AND FINANCIALLY   MATERIAL TOPICS     | IMPACT AND FINANCIALLY   MATERIAL TOPICS                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Workers in the   value chain (S2)            | Climate   change (E1) Affected   communities (S3) Resource use and   circular economy (E5) |\n| Pollution (E2) Water and marine   resources (E3) Consumers and   end-users (S4) | Own   workforce (S1) Business   conduct (G1) | Biodiversity and   ecosystems (E4)                                                         |\n\nIMPACT MATERIALITY\n\n## F I NAN C I AL MA T ER I AL I T Y\n\nMinimal / Informative / Important\n\nCrucial\n\n## Our DMA approach in brief\n\nAll assessed impacts and risks have been mapped to their relevant topical ESRS standard.

Each material ESRS topic is presented in the following tables, where we specify the sub-topics that our material impacts and risks relate to, e.g. climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, and energy.\n\nIn addition, we indicate in the tables whether the impacts and risks are in our own operations (OO) or value chain (VC). We also show whether our impacts are positive or negative. Impacts are actual impacts unless stated that they are potential  impacts.\n\nBrief descriptions of the material impacts and risks are included in the tables. More information on how we respond to the effects of our impacts and risks is included in the topical sections under ' Environment', 'Social', and 'Governance'.\n\nThis year, our scoring of impacts and risks has included mitigation actions that are already part of our daily operations to reduce or mitigate any negative impacts or risks. Therefore, the impacts and risks listed in the tables show a residual impact or risk.\n\nIn 2024, we will further refine our DMA process and methodology based on the new EFRAG guidance.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                           | Material impact or risk                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate change mitigation | Climate change mitigation                                                                                                              | Climate change mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Positive impact (OO)      |                                                                                                                                        | Renewable energy deployment.

Additionally, specific state-imposed forced labour  risks have have been reported in the solar PV supply chain. We therefore  have particular focus on forced labour and supply chain traceability in our  due diligence approach. |\n| Risk                      | Suppliers' breach of contractual  agreements on human rights  commitments. | Expansion of operations into high-risk geographies may increase the likeli- hood of suppliers breaching contractual human rights commitments, which  may lead to reputational damage and affect the ability to proceed with  project plans. We therefore use country risk as a screening and assessment  parameter in our due diligence approach.                                                              |\n\n## SOCIAL",

        "page_content": "## Double materiality assessment methodology\n\nWe developed our methodology with reference to the principles in the draft ESRS from November 2022 and available guidelines. Learnings from the 2023 process, dialogue with peers, and network and industry association meetings together with the final ESRS and  newest guidance will help refine the process to ensure full alignment with the DMA-related requirements in 2024.\n\n## Methodologies and assumptions\n\n## Scope\n\nFor our own operations, we identified and assessed impacts on people and the environment as well as potential risks to our business, focusing on specific activities where impacts are not relevant across technologies. Furthermore, we assessed our value chain impacts and risks for most topics, primarily focusing on our upstream activities. Value chain assessments were based on internal knowledge and mainly focused on our first-tier suppliers. This was especially true when identifying and assessing impacts related to 'Workers in the value chain' (ESRS S2).\n\nIn our impact assessment, we considered both positive and negative impacts as well as actual and potential impacts related to sustainability matters. In our financial assessment, we assessed potential sustainabilityrelated risks that could trigger a negative financial impact on our business.\n\nWe excluded assessing opportunities as part of our DMA this year. However, our business opportunities are directly connected to climate change mitigation and described in the strategy section. Moreover, ESRS S4 was excluded deliberately due to our business model.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nFor our DMA, we engaged internal subject-matter experts from both the business lines and Group functions. This year, we have not included direct consultation with affected stakeholders to understand how they may be impacted by our business activities, nor have we directly consulted external stakeholders to review the outcome of our DMA. However, as a valid proxy, we have included insights from our external affairs colleagues who, through continuous dialogue with our key stakeholders, have a good overview of the interests and views of stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, our continuous engagement activities in the communities in which we are present are a solid basis for assessing the impacts and risks most material to us.\n\n## Scoring\n\nImpacts\n\nAs per the ESRS guidance, three parameters of 'scale', 'scope', and 'irremediable character' have been used in the scoring of the 'severity' of our actual impacts:\n\n- 1   When scoring 'scale', we assessed how great the impact is on the environment or people, after consideration of mitigation actions already in place.\n- 2   When scoring 'scope', we assessed how widespread the impact is based on parameters such as percentage of sites, employees, or financial spend that the impact relates to.\n- 3   When scoring 'irremediable character', we assessed how difficult it is to reverse the damage in terms of cost and time horizon.\n\nFor potential impacts, an additional parameter of 'likelihood' was scored.\n\nFor negative actual impacts, each of the three dimensions above were scored and weighted equally for severity. For negative potential impacts, 'severity' and 'likelihood' were weighted 50/50. For positive actual impacts, 'scale' and 'scope' were scored and weighted equally for severity. For positive potential impacts, 'likelihood' was also considered as for negative potential impacts.\n\n## Risks\n\nWhen scoring risks, we assessed the potential magnitude of financial effects based on different triggers, including EBITDA, CAPEX, and OPEX, which constituted half of the score, and likelihood of occurrence, which constituted the other half. Assessments have included risk mitigation actions already in place.\n\nWe assessed the nature of these effects in different scenarios with assumptions based on input parameters from subject-matter experts. The potential magnitude of financial effects was scored as 'low', 'medium', or 'high'.\n\nLikelihood of occurrence was scored as 'low', 'medium', or 'high' using relevant time horizons of short-, mid-, or long-term. We partially modelled the risks using the risk assessment tool that we use for business risks. However, quantification in monetary terms was supplemented with qualitative assessments to a high degree, due to the complexity of defining exact values for potential sustainability risk scenarios.\n\n## Thresholds\n\nOur Sustainability Committee has set the materiality thresholds at 'significant'. This means that impacts and risks scored as 'significant' or above, and their associated ESRS topic, are deemed material.\n\n## Process\n\nWe defined process steps for conducting the DMA for impact materiality and financial materiality, respectively. The impact assessment was our starting point, and once we had the preliminary results, we initiated the financial assessment. We followed the five key steps below as further elaborated on the next page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Engagement of stakeholders\n\n2 Scoping of impacts/risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3 Assessment of individual impacts/risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 Calibration of material impacts/risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 Stakeholder and management review",

Engagement of stakeholders\n\nWe unfolded the ten topics in the ESRS and identified subject-matter experts in the business and Group functions with insights into the topics and deep knowledge of our day-to-day work with each area. Several onboarding sessions helped to get a common understanding of the new regulation and objectives of the double materiality assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Scoping of impacts\n\nAs preparation for the materiality assessment workshops, we consulted relevant internal information (e.g. internal impact reports, previous materiality assessments, and stakeholder findings) to scope and pre-define impacts per ESRS sub-topic and sub-sub-topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3. Assessment of individual impacts We conducted interactive impact materiality assessment workshops for each ESRS topic. Participants adjusted the pre-defined impacts where relevant and added additional impacts,\n\nAs part of our efforts to prepare for the CSRD, we delimited our financial materiality assessment and focused on potential financial risks. In contrast to the business risks covered in the 'Risks and risk management' section, we only consider risks that relate to sustainability matters in the financial materiality assessment.\n\n## The following steps were conducted:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1. Engagement of stakeholders We engaged relevant stakeholders to ensure appropriate consideration of sustainability risks. These included internal subject- matter experts in the business and Group functions, as well as teams responsible for corporate risk assessment.\n\n## 2. Scoping of risks\n\nResults from the impact materiality assessment, supplemented with additional internal resources, formed the basis for scoping sustainability risks within the context of financial materiality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3. Assessment of individual risks The initially identified risks were  verified and supplemented with additional possible sustainability risks through a series of meetings between topical subject-matter experts, ESG experts, and teams responsible for corporate risk\n\nthen scored all impacts (negative and positive) within our own operations and for the value chain according to the developed scoring methodology. Scoring rationales were documented, and relevant reference documents were captured. In total, 120 impacts were identified and scored.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4. Calibration of material impacts All workshop input was transferred to a tool to aggregate scores and calculate the 'degree of materiality' split into five levels. Workshop participants were consulted again for validation of the preliminary results, and if needed, the provided rationales for adjustments were documented. Further calibration across topics took place before finalising the impact assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5. Stakeholder and management review\n\nConsolidated overviews of the sustainabilityrelated impacts were presented to and discussed with internal stakeholders and management. Finally, the determined materiality threshold yielded a final list of 25 material impacts that were assessed as 'significant' or above.\n\nassessment. Throughout this process, the initial magnitude and likelihood properties of each potential risk were evaluated and documented. Based on these meetings, we formulated scenarios to capture the financial effects of the identified sustainability risks.\n\n## 4. Calibration of material risks The aggregated 20 sustainability-\n\nrelated financial risk scenarios were subsequently cate gorised following our scoring methodology approach. Additional resources were used to verify and calibrate the results. These included internal stakeholders and information from the business risk assessment, as well as external  studies and benchmark reports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.

The insights gained from these continuous dialogues serve to inform our due diligence processes and double materiality assessment.\n\nGuided by principles of openness, transparency, and integrity, our stakeholder engagement policy adheres to international norms and codes, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.\n\nWe ensure that the views and interests of affected stakeholders regarding our sustainability-related impacts are regularly communicated to our Sustainability Committee through periodic committee meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image

This was primarily due to lower non- eligible revenue from our gas sales, driven by lower gas  volumes sold and lower prices.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX\n\nOur taxonomy-aligned share of CAPEX in 2023 remained at 99 % and is primarily related to our wind and solar farms and storage facilities.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned OPEX\n\nOur taxonomy-aligned OPEX was 79 %, a decrease of 1 percentage point compared to 2022.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned EBITDA (voluntary)\n\nOur taxonomy-aligned share of EBITDA in 2023 was 95 %, an increase of 10 percentage points compared to 2022. This was due to significantly decreased non-eligible earnings from our gas sales and fossilbased generation at our CHP plants.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned revenue (turnover)\n\nThis is the revenue associated with taxonomyaligned economic activities as a proportion of our total revenue. It is adjusted for green bonds by excluding the revenue from our taxonomyaligned assets financed with green bonds from the taxonomy-aligned revenue (numerator) and the total revenue (denominator).\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX\n\nThis is the CAPEX related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities as a proportion of our CAPEX that is accounted for based on IAS 16 (73: (e)(i) and (iii)), IAS 38 (118: (e)(i)), and IFRS 16 (53: (h)).  Carbon emission allowances and goodwill have been excluded. It is adjusted for green bonds by excluding the CAPEX financed with green bond proceeds from the taxonomy-aligned CAPEX (numerator) and the total CAPEX (denominator).\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned OPEX\n\nThis is the maintenance and repair OPEX related to our assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities as a proportion of the maintenance and repair OPEX of our 'Other external expenses'. We have updated our accounting policy to include estimates of the maintenance and repair costs of 'other external expenses' using a Group-level factor based on maintenance and repair costs for each business segment.\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned EBITDA (voluntary)\n\nThis is the EBITDA associated with taxonomyaligned economic activities as a proportion of our total EBITDA. We have included taxonomyaligned EBITDA as a voluntary disclosure as it better reflects our business as our gas and power sales business has a large revenue but a small earnings margin, while other areas have a higher margin.\n\n## Taxonomy-non-eligible KPIs\n\nRevenue, CAPEX, OPEX, and EBITDA associated with taxonomy-non-eligible activities (not included in the delegated acts) have been determined. Taxonomy-non-eligible revenue and EBITDA are classified into gas sales, fossilbased generation, and other activities.",

        "page_content": "## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible activities\n\nWe have identified our taxonomy-eligible activities by screening the economic activities in the Climate Delegated Act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139), the Complementary Climate Delegated Act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214), the Environmental  Delegated Act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486), and the amendments to the  Climate Delegated Act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485).\n\nFive activities in the Climate Delegated Act have been identified as eligible for \u00d8rsted:\n\n- \u00b7 Manufacture of hydrogen (3.10)\n- \u00b7 Electricity generation using solar PV technology (4.1)\n- \u00b7 Electricity generation from wind power (4.3)\n- \u00b7 Storage of electricity (4.10)\n- \u00b7 Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from bioenergy (4.20)\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned activities\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852, article 3, sets out criteria which an economic activity must meet to qualify as environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned):\n\n- \u00b7 Substantially contribute to one or more of the six environmental objectives.\n- \u00b7 Do no significant harm (DNSH) to the other five objectives.\n- \u00b7 Comply with minimum safeguards covering social and governance standards.\n- \u00b7 Comply with the technical screening criteria (TSC) for the environmental objectives.\n\nTaxonomy-alignment of our eligible activites has subsequently been assessed against annex I of the Climate Delegated Act. The TSC for the environmental objectives have been assessed per activity. Minimum safeguards have been assessed on Group level.\n\n## Substantial contribution\n\nClimate change mitigation We have assessed and documented whether our taxonomy-eligible activities fulfil the substantial contribution criteria to climate change mitigation.\n\nFor activity 3.10, our manufactured hydrogen will meet the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings requirement in article 25(2) and annex V to Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The calculation of life cycle GHG emission savings follows the methodology referred to in article 28(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and the quantification methodology has been verified by an independent third party. The quantified life cycle GHG emission savings are subject to final verification by an independent third party upon the asset's operation, expectedly during 2025.\n\nFor activities 4.1, 4.3, and 4.10, our solar and wind farms and storage facilities automatically fulfil the substantial contribution criteria to climate change mitigation as we generate electricity using solar PV technology and wind power, and as we construct and operate electricity storage facilities.\n\nFor activity 4.20, the sustainable biomass used at our combined heat and power (CHP) plants complies with the criteria in article 29, paragraphs 2-7 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and with the GHG emission savings criteria.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nWe have not assessed our taxonomy-eligible activities against the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation, as the primary objective of our activities is to contribute to climate change mitigation.\n\n## Do no significant harm (DNSH)\n\nClimate change adaptation\n\nWe have assessed and documented how asset resilience towards different chronic and extreme climate hazards and their future development, as projected by IPCC, is an\n\nintegrated part of our project development and have confirmed that our assets are resilient and able to withstand projected climate changes during the assets' lifetime.\n\nIt is assessed that all relevant eligible activities comply with the criteria set out in appendix A to annex I of the Climate Dele gated Act.\n\nSustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nWe are legally required to conduct environmental impact assessments (EIAs) as part of all our projects to ensure that potential impacts on water and marine resources are avoided, mitigated, and addressed appropriately. During this process, we consider environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress. We have internal processes on legal compliance and water to ensure all assets live up to the requirements. In addition, we have a water policy, establishing our approach to responsible water management.\n\nFor activity 4.3, we work to ensure that construction of offshore wind does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, taking measures to prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to the directive's descriptor 11 (noise/ energy).\n\nIt is assessed that all relevant eligible activities comply with the criteria set out in appendix B to annex I of the Climate Delegated Act.\n\n## Transition to a circular economy\n\nRenewable assets are built of highly durable materials. To ensure reuse and recycling of materials where feasible, we have a resource management policy and internal waste management processes in place. To ensure we further transition to a circular economy, we have implemented a strategic approach focused on: (i) using fewer virgin resources, (ii) using resources better and longer, and (iii) recirculating resources upon end of life.\n\nFor each tax onomy activity, we also have circular economy initiatives in place.\n\n## Pollution prevention and control\n\nWe are legally required to conduct EIAs to ensure that potential pollution impacts are avoided, mitigated, and addressed appropriately, and that pollution requirements are integrated into our environmental permit conditions. We have internal processes in place to fulfil these legal requirements.\n\nFor activities 3.10 and 4.20, it has been assessed that emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions. No significant cross-media effects have been identified.\n\nIt is assessed that all relevant eligible activities comply with the criteria set out in appendix C to annex I of the Climate Delegated Act.\n\n## Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nWe are legally required to conduct EIAs as part of all our projects to ensure potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems are avoided, mitigated, and addressed appropriately. Our 'Offshore wind biodiversity policy' and internal processes ensure all our assets live up to the requirements. We have also committed to ensure that all new renewable energy projects we commission from 2030 onwards deliver a net-positive biodiversity impact, which we aim to achieve through our biodiversity efforts.\n\nFor activity 4.3, we work to ensure that the construction of offshore wind does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, taking appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to the directive's descriptors 1 (biodiversity) and 6 (seabed integrity).\n\nIt is assessed that all relevant eligible activities comply with the criteria set out in appendix D to annex I of the Climate Delegated Act.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nOur 'Human rights policy' sets out our commitment to respect human rights and lives up to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and OECD's guidelines for multinational enterprises, including the principles of the Declaration of the International Labour Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights, both in our own operations and supply chain.\n\nTogether with our good governance practices and policies, our systematic due diligence approach ensures we have robust minimum safeguards in place on human rights, corruption, taxation, and fair competition.\n\n## Taxonomy KPIs\n\nOur accounting policies for the taxonomy KPIs are based on our interpretation of the Disclosures Delegated Act annex I (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/4987) and available guidelines from the European Commission.\n\n## Linkage principle\n\nThe revenue, CAPEX, OPEX, and EBITDA associated with our taxonomy-aligned activities have been determined. In allocating the financial numbers to the numerator, a 'linkage principle' has been applied, stipulating that any revenue, CAPEX, OPEX, or EBITDA that can be justifiably linked to an identified taxonomy-aligned activity can be classified as taxonomy-aligned and thereby included in the numerator of the respective KPI.\n\n## Double counting\n\nWe have avoided double counting across economic activities in the allocation of the numerator for revenue, CAPEX, OPEX, and EBITDA by using activity-specific factors to allocate the financials across our taxonomy\n\nactivities. The factors are either 100 %, 0 %, or a value in between where we have used proxies to split the financial numbers into taxonomy- aligned or non-eligible activities. Here, the factors cannot sum to more than 100 %, which eliminates the possibility of double counting the resulting financial numbers.\n\n## Proxies\n\nWhere the financial numbers are not appropriately split into the correct activity in the financial account set-up, proxies have been used to split the numbers. Two proxies have been used:\n\n1) The ratio of purchased power volumes from renewable versus non-renewable assets applied to revenue and EBITDA from balancing activities.\n\n2) Bioenergy's share of renewable energy generation - applied to revenue, EBITDA, CAPEX, and OPEX related to the CHP plants.\n\nFor more details on our taxonomy-aligned KPIs, see our accounting policies on p. 81.",

        "page_content": "## Climate scenario analysis\n\nAs our vision is to create a world that runs entirely on green energy, climate-related risks and opportunities are directly linked to our business model and strategy. It is therefore embedded in our operations to assess the climate resilience of our business by looking at climaterelated transition and physical risks and opportunities, in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nClimate-related transition risks and opportunities are an integrated aspect of the business cases for our investments in new assets and activities, and we continuously monitor political, technological, market, and reputational developments. Similarly, in the design and construction phases of our assets, we carry out climate risk assessments to assess acute and chronic weather developments, taking into account extreme weather conditions and events that could physically affect our assets. In addition, our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets follow scenarios from the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) 1.5 \u00b0C sectorspecific pathway for the power industry.\n\nIn 2023, our assessment of physical climate risks included two dimensions: design safeguards and business case risks. The assessment of design safeguards entails a climate risk assessment to affirm the physical resilience of our assets in the face of climate change, particularly during extreme weather events. In addition, the business case risk assessment evaluates how revenue streams, and the overall value of assets, might be impacted, e.g. if the wind speed is projected to change at an asset location.\n\nOur analysis focused on all operational assets, both offshore and onshore, with capacities exceeding 10 MW across all markets, representing the vast majority of our climate risk exposure. The analysis  utilised the latest climate projection data, downscaled to regional and asset-level granularity, based on the IPCC SSP5-8.5 scenario, which is typically considered a 'worst-case scenario'.\n\nOur findings reconfirm that all our assets are structurally secured against climate change through a set of design safeguards and mitigation actions. From a business case perspective, the most significant climate risk for our portfolio is changing wind patterns and, to a lesser extent, changes in air temperature, as these factors have the highest potential impact on the overall energy production of our assets. The 2023 analysis indicates only a minor change in asset value compared to projections based on historical climate data.\n\nWe have several mitigation actions in place to reduce this risk, and the current impact is considered insignificant to our business cases. However, we acknowledge the need for further investigation going forward as we strive to reduce uncertainties associated with our assessments. We will continue to develop our methodology to ensure we are capturing our exposure to climate risk as accurately as possible, while further exploring ways to integrate climate change considerations into our existing processes.\n\n## Classification of climate-related hazards, cf. the TCFD classification and the EU taxonomy's Climate Delegated Act\n\n| CHRONIC                                                      | ACUTE            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Temperature-related                                          |                  |\n| \u2713   Changing temperature (air, freshwater,   marine water) \u2713 | \u2713   Heat wave \u2713  |\n| Heat  stress Temperature  variability  Permafrost  thawing   | Cold  wave/frost |\n|                                                              | \u2713  Wildfire      |\n| \u2713                                                            |                  |\n| \u00d7                                                            |                  |\n\n## Water-related\n\n- \u2713    Changing precipitation patterns and types (rain, hail, snow/ice)\n- \u2713    Precipitation or hydrological variability\n- \u2713 Ocean  acidification\n- \u2713 Saline  intrusion\n- \u2713 Sea  level  rise\n- \u2713 Water  stress\n\n## Wind-related\n\n- \u2713 Changing  wind  patterns\n- \u2713 Cyclone,  hurricane,  typhoon\n- \u2713    Storm (including blizzards, dust, and sandstorms)\n- \u2713 Tornado\n\n## Solid mass-related\n\n- \u2713 Coastal  erosion\n- \u2713 Soil  degradation\n- \u2713 Soil  erosion\n- \u00d7 Avalanche\n- \u2713 Landslide\n- \u2713 Subsidence\n- \u2713 Solifluction\n- \u2713  Hazard included in assessment  \u00d7  Hazard not relevant to include due to geographical location of assets\n- \u2713 Drought\n- \u2713    Heavy precipitation (rain, hail, snow/ice)\n- \u2713    Flood (coastal, fluvial, pluvial, groundwater)\n- \u00d7 Glacial lake outburst",

This aspiration drives our determination to deliver renewable energy solutions that not only generate green energy but also reduce emissions throughout the manufacturing, transportation, installation, and operation of our renewable energy assets. In doing so, we actively contribute to the transition to an urgently needed net-zero  economy.\n\nAddressing climate change is in the core of our business model and strategy, with our  sustainability commitment and industry-leading science-based 2040 net-zero target as the catalysts behind our efforts to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy deployment.\n\nOur sustainability commitment and science-based net-zero target are anchored in our Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. Accountability lies with our Head of Global Stakeholder Relations and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nWe are also actively calling our stakeholders to action for activities that will accelerate the renewable energy build-out in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We believe there is a need for more transparency\n\naround climate-related advocacy to help clear the path towards faster deployment of renewable energy.\n\nOur first climate advocacy report therefore features an assessment of our most important industry associations in terms of their alignment with the 1.5 \u00b0C Paris Agreement goal, their promotion of renewable energy, and their stance on the phase-out of fossil fuels. With the report, we aim to emphasise our efforts to accelerate a renewable energy build-out that pursues emissions reductions, protects nature, and creates a transition that is equitable for all.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nAs a long-standing industry leader in sustainability, we recognise that, alongside our positive impact from scaling renewable energy deployment, we have a key role in reducing possible negative impacts, such as emissions from the extraction and manufacturing of materials and main components needed for the successful transition towards renewable energy sources.\n\nWe are committed to not only measuring and tracking greenhouse gas emissions, but also actively working towards their reduction. Our approach for our own operations includes phasing out coal in 2024.

While investments in wind and solar directly contribute to the increase in renewable energy generation capacity, bioenergy serves as an alternative to fossil fuels, P2X enables non-electric applications (e.g. transport and chemicals) and helps to reduce emissions from hard-toabate sectors, and CCS enables permanent storage of carbon underground. Together, these technologies play a key role in building sustainable global energy systems.\n\n## Science-aligned climate action\n\nTo align our core business activities with our sustainability ambition, we have adopted a science-based target to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, which has been formally validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This overarching target is supported by a suite of near-term and long-term  decarbonisation targets across our full value chain. In addition to tracking and monitoring our company-wide emissions reduction progress, we utilise the climate targets internally to anchor our strategic initiatives. These include, for example, decarbonisation of our supply chains for materials and components.\n\nTo contribute to the global net-zero goal in the most impactful way, we are committed to go beyond\n\nreducing our own emissions and to contribute to climate action outside our value chain. We finance and develop our own high-quality nature-based projects in addition to reducing our emissions - not instead of doing so.\n\nWe are on track to phase out coal in 2024 and to reduce our scope 1-2 emissions intensity by 98 % by 2025 - two near-term milestones towards our science based 2040 net-zero target. We also continue our financial commitment to nature-based projects and the implementation of our own quality considerations, which include proven additionality and positive impacts for local communities and biodiversity. By 2025, we will have taken final investment decision on a portfolio of projects which over their lifetime will deliver a volume of certified carbon credits  exceeding the residual 2 % of our future scope 1-2 emissions. However, the actual delivery of carbon credits from these projects will be delayed a few years compared to our initial expectations.\n\nWe have decided to phase out our use of the wording 'carbon-neutral company by 2025' when describing the impact of carbon credits. Since 2020, when we made the commitment to become a carbon-neutral company, the consensus on carbon-neutral claims has changed. While back then, such claims proved useful for incentivising and increasing the ambitions of corporate climate action, we now have the SBTi NetZero Standard to guide how companies can take the actions urgently needed to meet the 1.5 \u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.\n\nOur approach to carbon credits reflects what the SBTi refers to as 'beyond value chain mitigation' in\n\nits Net-Zero Standard. In line with this direction set by the SBTi, we will therefore no longer use the wording 'carbon- neutral' to describe our progress in decarbonising our operations and energy generation (scope 1-2).\n\n## Supply chain decarbonisation\n\nThe majority of our upstream value chain emissions come from hard-to-abate sectors like steel, shipping, and heavy manufacturing. We have therefore identified and deployed several strategic levers to reduce emissions from our supply chains:\n\n- \u00b7 Tracking and measuring carbon progress through the development of an in-house model for life cycle assessments (LCAs). The model is currently used to calculate the total carbon footprint of our new offshore wind farms and will be further developed to cover onshore wind, solar PV technologies, and the more recent technologies in our portfolio. Additionally, to enhance the transparency and comparability of data for our stakeholders, we are contributing to the development of a standardized LCA methodology together with other energy developers.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with suppliers on the integration of decarbonisation strategies in their operations. Decarbonisation is at the core of our supplier relationship management. We actively engage key suppliers, who account for more than half of our total procurement spend and encompass some of the most carbon-intensive segments of our supply chains. This includes the adoption of science-based targets, transparent climate reporting to CDP, and covering electricity consumption with renewable electricity.\n- \u00b7 Entering into offtake agreements for low-emission products essential to the energy transition. We contribute towards the scaling of new technologies by reducing uncertainties for suppliers and  further incentivising their investments in low-emission technologies.\n- \u00b7 Engaging in cross-sector collaborations to drive demand for ground-breaking technologies. Together with other sustainability leaders we pool our purchasing powers to drive demand for technologies needed to decarbonise materials in our operation. We have co-founded cross-industry initiatives such as the Climate Group's SteelZero and the World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition, where we commit to offtake volumes of near-zero emissions materials from 2030.\n\n## Actions\n\n## Own operations\n\nDuring 2023, we have taken the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 We have deployed 0.6 GW of new renewable capacity from onshore wind power and solar power, reaching a total of 15.7 GW installed renewable capacity.\n- \u00b7 We have begun the construction of two CCS facilities designed to capture and store carbon emissions from the biomass-fired Asn\u00e6s and Aved\u00f8re power stations. This project represents Denmark's first fullscale carbon capture project. For more information, see our strategy section.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 We have allocated 99 % of our capital expenditures (CAPEX) towards environmentally sustainable investments aligned with the EU taxonomy. For more information, see the EU taxonomy section.\n- \u00b7 We have signed a second contract with ESVAGT for a methanol-powered service operation vessel, marking a significant milestone in our efforts to decarbonise offshore wind operations.\n- \u00b7 We no longer acquire, or lease, vehicles powered by fossil fuels, and 65 % of our vehicle fleet is currently electric, an increase from 51 % in 2022.\n- \u00b7 We continued to advance our portfolio of naturebased carbon removal projects by planting approximately 40 million propagules in Gambia, equivalent to around 4,000 ha, thereby contributing further to the restoration of vital ecosystems and mitigating climate change.\n- \u00b7 To address physical risks resulting from climate change and their potential impact on our assets, we assess the resilience of all new assets towards the occurrence of climate-related hazards. For more information, see the EU taxonomy and climate scenario analysis sections.\n\n## Future actions:\n\n- \u00b7 We will continue to deploy renewable energy and drive down emissions across scope 1-2.\n- \u00b7 In 2025, more than 99 % of our energy generation will come from renewable sources, and in 2030, our ambition is to reach 35-38 GW installed renewable capacity.\n- \u00b7 We are making the preparations and are on track to phase out coal-based energy generation before 2025.\n- \u00b7 In 2024, the world's first green fuel vessel for offshore wind operations will launch off the UK East Coast, as a result of the agreement between \u00d8rsted and ESVAGT.\n- \u00b7 We will continue to phase out our fossil-fuelled vehicles, and by the end of 2025, our entire light vehicle fleet will be electric.\n- \u00b7 During 2025, the Asn\u00e6s and Aved\u00f8re power stations will begin to capture and store biogenic carbon.\n- \u00b7 We are committed to further enhancing our portfolio of nature-based carbon removal projects and are actively involved in the development of new initiatives in Africa and Southeast Asia, in collaboration with Danish NGOs and local community organisations.\n\n## Value chain\n\nDuring 2023, we have taken the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Together with the Carbon Trust and eleven energy developers, we have launched a joint industry programme to develop the first industry-backed method for calculating the life cycle carbon footprint of offshore wind farms. This common methodology will help increase transparency for governments, investors, and suppliers and enable comparability across developers and assets.\n- \u00b7 We have begun integrating our climate expectations into key supplier contracts, including CDP reporting, science-based target setting, and covering electricity consumption with renewable electricity. These requirements apply to suppliers in a number of high-impact categories, which collectively contribute significantly to our supply chain emissions and procurement spend.\n- \u00b7 We have procured low-carbon copper for the export cable scope for the world's single largest wind farm, Hornsea 3 in the UK. By choosing low-carbon copper, we have reduced the emissions from the export cable scope by approximately 50 %.\n- \u00b7 We have formed an industry-leading partnership with wind turbine supplier Vestas, including an early offtake agreement. We pledge to procure 25 % low-emission steel turbine towers for all joint projects, and, when available, blades made with recycled materials.\n- \u00b7 We have signed a long-term large-scale supply agreement with Dillinger, our key steel manufacturer for foundations, which in part has enabled Dillinger to invest in a low-emission steel production route (DRI-EAF). This investment will reduce Dillinger's company emissions by 55 % in 2030.\n- \u00b7 To increase the collective demand signal for nearzero steel, we have joined the First Mover Coalition's Near-Zero Steel 2030 Challenge. The initiative builds on our near-zero steel commitments and aims to accelerate investments in near-zero steel by mapping suppliers' and companies' existing plans and connecting buyers with future suppliers of near-zero steel.\n\n## Future actions:\n\n- \u00b7 We will strive for a common standard to  measure the life cycle carbon footprint of offshore wind farms, fostering comparability and amplifying transparency of embodied emissions.\n- \u00b7 We will continue to develop tools to support our suppliers in their green transformations as we enhance the incorporation of sustainability in our sourcing processes. From 2024, we will also start engaging with suppliers on biodiversity, circularity, the carbon footprint of their products, and on their climate engagement of their own supply chains.\n- \u00b7 We will continue to seek out partnerships with key strategic suppliers to further incentivise investments in low-emission technologies.",

These new targets outline the pathway for our near-term efforts to decarbonise our value chain,\n\nScope 1-2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity g CO2e/kWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhile also putting a cap on emissions from natural gas sales based on the substantive reductions we have already achieved.\n\nOur new 2030 targets have been submitted to the SBTi and are currently undergoing their formal target  validation process. The SBTi expressed that they welcome our more ambitious 2030 decarbonisation targets, which provide a greater visibility on the pathway towards our science-based 2040 net-zero target.\n\nScope 1-3 greenhouse gas emissions intensity (excl. natural gas sales) g CO2e/kWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas sales Mt CO2e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to continue driving the global transition to renewable energy sources. We are on track to reach our target of 99 % renewable energy generation by 2025. Our commitment is reinforced by our strategic ambition to enhance our renewable energy capacity, aiming to reach a gross installed capacity of 35-38 GW by 2030. For more information on our ambition for installed renewable capacity, please refer to the 'Strategy and business' section.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We include all capacities after commercial operation date (COD) has been reached, and where we had an ownership share and an EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) role in the project. Capacities from acquisitions are added to the installed capacity. For installed renewable thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity, as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy generation, and as bioconversions of the combined heat and power plants are driven by heat contracts.\n\n## Decided (FID'ed) renewable capacity\n\nDecided (FID'ed) capacity is renewable capacity where a final investment decision (FID) has been made.\n\n## Awarded and contracted renewable capacity\n\nThe awarded renewable capacity is based on the capacities which have been awarded to \u00d8rsted in auctions and tenders. The contracted renewable capacity is the capacity for which \u00d8rsted has signed a contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) concerning a new renewable energy asset. We include the full capacity if more than 50 % of PPAs or offtake is secured. We only include awarded/contracted capacity for projects that we expect to develop.",

Offshore wind power generation capacity increased by 314 MW, primarily due to the ramp-up of our offshore wind farms Greater Changhua 1 and 2a in Taiwan. Onshore wind power generation capacity increased by 253 MW, primarily due to the commissioning of the onshore wind farm Sunflower Wind (201 MW) in the US. Solar PV power generation capacity increased by 357 MW AC due to the partial commissioning of the solar farm Old 300 in the US.\n\nThermal power generation capacity (based on oil) increased by 260 MW in 2023 due to an extra unit at Kyndby Peak Load Plant being temporarily back in operation. Heat generation capacity (electric) increased by 200 MW, as four new electric boilers were commissioned at Studstrup Power Station in February 2023.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Power generation capacity\n\nPower generation capacity for an offshore wind farm is calculated and included from the time when the individual wind turbine has passed a 240-hour test. Power generation capacities for onshore wind and solar farms are included after commercial operation date (COD) has been reached. The offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands 1 & 2 and Walney 1 & 2 have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms, and combined heat and power (CHP) plants have been financially consolidated.\n\n## Heat and power generation capacity, thermal\n\nThermal heat and power generation  capacity is a measure of the maximum capability to generate heat and power. The capacity may change over time with plant modifications. For each CHP plant, the capacity is given for  generation with the primary fuel mix. Overload is not included. CHP plants which have been taken out of primary operation and put on standby are not included.\n\nFuel-specific thermal heat and power generation capacities measure the maximum capacity using the specified fuel as primary fuel at the multi-fuel plants. They cannot be added to total thermal capacity, as they are defined individually for each fuel type for our multi-fuel plants. All fuels cannot be used at the same time. Therefore, the total sum amounts to more than 100 %.",

Availability in 2023 was 1 percentage point lower than in 2022. The higher wind speeds resulted in a 1 percentage point increase of the load factor in 2023.\n\n## Onshore wind\n\nOnshore wind speeds in 2023 were 3 % lower than in 2022 and 3 % lower than in a normal wind year. Availability was 5  percentage points lower in 2023 than in 2022. The lower wind speeds and availability resulted in a 4 percentage point lower load factor in 2023.\n\n## Solar PV\n\nAvailability in 2023 was at the same level as in 2022, but the load factor decreased by 1 percentage point.\n\n## Other\n\nThe number of degree days in 2023 was 1 % higher than in 2022, indicating that the weather in 2023 was slightly colder than in 2022.\n\nIn Q4 2023, the number of degree days was 12 % higher than in Q4 2022, which means that the weather at the end of 2023 was much colder than in 2022.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Wind speeds\n\nWind speeds for the areas where \u00d8rsted's offshore and onshore wind farms are located are provided to \u00d8rsted by an external supplier. Wind speeds are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the individual wind farms and consolidated to an \u00d8rsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 'Normal wind speed' is a historical wind speed average (over a minimum 20-year period).\n\n## Availability\n\nAvailability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by marketrequested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments as these are due to external factors.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe load factor is calculated as the ratio between actual generation over a period relative to potential generation, which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period. The load factor is commercially adjusted. This means that the offshore wind farm has been financially compensated by the transmission system operators when it is available for generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. New offshore wind turbines are included in the calculations of availability and load factor once they have passed a 240-hour test. Onshore wind turbines are included once they have passed commercial operation date (COD).\n\n## Degree days\n\nThe number of degree days expresses the difference between an average indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C and the outside mean temperature for a given period. It helps compare the heat demand for a given year with a normal year.",

The increase in generation at our European onshore wind farms was offset by decreased generation at several of our US onshore wind farms. Solar PV generation increased by 12 % to 2.1 TWh due to increased generation at our solar farm Old 300.\n\nThermal power generation decreased by 26 % in 2023, primarily driven by lower condensing generation due to lower power prices and market spreads compared to 2022.\n\nHeat generation was 3 % higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to colder weather in 2023, especially in Q4 2023.\n\nGas sales decreased significantly by 47 % to 16.9 TWh in 2023. This was primarily due to lower UK sourcing volumes, mainly due to the phasing out of our UK B2B activities as well as expired contracts. It was also due to Gazprom Export's suspension of its gas supplies to \u00d8rsted on 1 June 2022 and \u00d8rsted's subsequent termination of the supply contract during Q1 2023.\n\nPower sales decreased by 8 % to 21.4 TWh in 2023 due to a 62 % and 37 % decrease in green and regular power to end customers, respectively. This was primarily driven by the phasing out of our UK B2B business. The decrease was partly offset by a 3 % increase in wholesale power to 19.0 TWh, primarily driven by the 50 % farm-down of the fully operational offshore wind farm Hornsea 2 in Q3 2022, resulting in increased power volumes sold on behalf of our partners.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Power generation\n\nPower generation from wind and solar farms is determined as generation sold. The offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands 1 & 2 and Walney 1 & 2 have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms, and combined heat and power (CHP) plants have been financially consolidated.\n\nThermal power generation is determined as net generation sold, based on settlements from the official Danish production database. Data for generation from foreign facilities is provided by the operators.\n\n## Heat generation\n\nHeat (including steam) generation is measured as net output sold to heat customers.\n\n## Gas and power sales\n\nSales of gas and power are calculated as physical sales to retail and wholesale customers and exchanges. Sales are based on readings from \u00d8rsted's trading systems. Internal sales to our combined heat and power (CHP) plants are not included in the statement.",

This was partly offset by higher heat demand and thereby higher biomass-based generation in Q4 2023.\n\nThe 1 percentage point increase in other renewable energy sources was driven by heat generation from the new electric boilers at the Studstrup Power Station using sourced green power.\n\nThe share of coal-based generation decreased by 2 percentage points, mainly driven by lower coal-based condensing driven by significantly lower power spot prices, hence reduced spreads.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Share of renewable energy generation\n\nThe renewable energy share of our heat and power generation is calculated on the basis of the energy sources used and the energy generated at the different assets.\n\nFor combined heat and power (CHP) plants, the share of the specific fuel (e.g. sustainable biomass) is calculated relative to the total fuel consumption for a given plant or unit within a given time period.\n\nThe specific fuel share is then multiplied by the total heat and power generation for the specific plant or unit in the specific period. The result is the fuel-based generation for the individual plant or unit, for example the sustainable biomass-based generation of heat and power from the CHP plant unit within a given time period.\n\nThe percentage shares of the individual energy sources are calculated by dividing the generation from the individual energy source by the total generation.\n\nThe following energy sources and fuels are considered to be renewable energy: wind, solar PV, sustainable biomass, biogas, and power sourced with renewable energy certificates. The following energy sources are considered to be fossil energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.",

Fuel consumption decreased more than thermal generation because of lower  condensing generation in 2023 compared to 2022. Condensing generation (power generation only) has lower fuel efficiency than combined heat and power generation.\n\nThe consumption of sustainable biomass decreased by 11 %, primarily due to the switch from  sustainable biomass to coal-based generation at Studstrup Power Station following a fire in the wood pellet silo in the\n\nautumn of 2022. In Q2 2023, we switched back to sustainable biomass at Studstrup Power Station. In addition, there has been lower biomass condensing in 2023 due to lower power prices.\n\nThe consumption of coal decreased by 43 %, mainly due to lower coal-based condensing driven by significantly lower power spot prices in 2023, hence reduced spreads.\n\nNatural gas consumption increased by 158 % in 2023, mainly driven by lower gas prices and improved spreads compared to 2022.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Direct energy consumption (GHG, scope 1)\n\nDirect energy consumption includes all energy consumption, including energy consumption that leads to scope 1 GHG emissions. Energy consumption includes all fuels used at combined heat and power (CHP) plants (lower caloric values) and other energy usage (oil, natural gas, and diesel).\n\n## Certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced\n\nCertified sustainable wooden biomass sourced is calculated as the amount of certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced divided by the total amount of sourced wooden biomass, i.e. wood pellets and wood chips, delivered to  individual CHP plants within the reporting period. Certified sustainable wooden biomass must be certified within at least one of the claim categories accepted by the Danish industry agreement on certified biomass. Accepted claim categories are: FSC 100 %, FSC Mix, PEFC 100 %, and SBP-compliant.\n\n## Indirect energy consumption (GHG, scope 2)\n\nHeat and power purchased and consumed by \u00d8rsted are reported for CHP plants, other facilities, and administrative buildings. Heat and power consumption excludes consumption of own generated heat and power at our CHP plants. For consumption related to administration and other processes, we calculate direct consumption on the basis of invoices.\n\n## Green share of total direct and indirect energy consumption\n\nThe green share is calculated as renewable energy sourced (biomass and certified green power) for own consumption divided by total energy sourced for own consumption.\n\n## Internal energy savings\n\nThe scope of the energy savings covers both heat and power consumption and process optimisation savings at our CHP plants (i.e. fuel savings, GHG scope 1). Projects are included when they are fully implemented and operational.\n\nElectric vehicles in the company vehicle fleet \u00d8rsted is a member of the Climate Group's EV100 initiative. The statement is prepared on the basis of the EV100 guidelines.",

The main driver was the 43 % decrease in the use of coal, partly offset by the 158 % increase in the use of natural gas.\n\nIn 2023, fossil fuel-based heat and power generation was accountable for 97 % of the total scope 1 emissions. Fuel for vessels are the main contributor to the remaining 3 %.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nLocation-based scope 2 emissions increased by 107 % from 2022 to 2023. The main source of location-based scope 2 emissions was power purchased for the generation of heat in electric boilers at our CHP plants.\n\nAll power purchased and consumed by \u00d8rsted is certified green power. Therefore, our market-based scope 2 GHG emissions from power consumption amounted to zero tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents, and the remaining one thousand tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents came from our heat consumption.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 49 % from 2022 to 2023, primarily driven by the 47 % reduction in scope 3 emissions from natural gas sales ( category  11).\n\nScope 3 emissions from capital goods (category 2) decreased by 94 % as we only commissioned four onshore wind farms (totalling 253 MW) in 2023, whereas we commissioned more wind farms in 2022, including the offshore wind farm Hornsea 2 (1,320 MW). The scope 3 impact from the partly-commissioned solar farm Old 300 will be reported when the solar farm is fully commissioned, expectedly in 2024.\n\nScope 3 emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3) decreased by 28 % due to the 37 % reduction in regular power sales to end customers and the 21 % reduction in fuel consumption at the CHP plants in 2023.\n\n## GHG emissions outside of scope 1-3\n\nDirect biogenic carbon emissions were 11 % lower in 2023 than in 2022 as a result of the 11 % reduction in the use of sustainable biomass as fuel.",

The decrease was the result of a 37 % decrease in scope 1 emissions due to lower coal consumption (numerator) and unchanged total heat and power generation (denominator).\n\nThe GHG emissions intensity of revenue was reduced by 9 %, and the GHG emissions intensity of EBITDA increased by 9 % following the 37 % reduction in GHG emissions (denominator), the 31 % reduction in revenue, and the 42 % reduction in EBITDA (denominators).\n\n## GHG intensity (scope 1, 2, and 3)\n\nScope 1, 2, and 3 GHG intensity (excluding emissions from natural gas sales) decreased by 46 % from 2022 to 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by the 37 % reduction in scope 1 and the 52 % reduction in scope 3 emissions, excluding natural gas sales (numerator), in addition to an unchanged total heat and power generation (denominator).\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Direct GHG emissions (scope 1)\n\nScope 1 emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and cover all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from \u00d8rsted: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexafluoride. The direct carbon emissions from the combined heat and power plants are determined based on the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are primarily calculated as energy consumption multiplied by emission factors.\n\n## Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2)\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported based on the GHG Protocol and include indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed by \u00d8rsted. Scope 2 emissions are primarily calculated as the power volumes purchased multiplied by country-specific emission factors. Location-based emissions are calculated based on average country-specific emission factors. Market-based emissions take into account renewable power purchased and assume that regular power is delivered as residual power.\n\n## Indirect GHG emissions (scope 3)\n\nScope 3 emissions are reported based on the GHG Protocol, where the scope 3 inventory is split into 15 subcategories (C1-C15):\n\nC1 is categorised spend data multiplied by relevant spend-category-specific emission factors.\n\nC2 includes upstream GHG emissions (cradle to operations) from acquired and installed wind and solar farms in the month when the wind or solar farm has reached commercial operation date (COD).\n\nC3 is calculated based on actual fuel consumption and power sales to end customers multiplied by relevant emission factors. We use separate emission factors for green and regular power sales.\n\nC4 only includes fuel for helicopter transport. Emissions from other transport types are included in the emission factors we use for  purchased goods and services.\n\nC5 is calculated based on actual waste data multiplied by relevant emission factors.\n\nC6 is calculated based on mileage allowances for employee travel in own cars and GHG emissions from plane travel provided by our travel agent.\n\nC7 is calculated based on estimates of the distance travelled and travel type (e.g. car or train).\n\nC9 is calculated based on volumes of residual products, estimated distances transported, and relevant emission factors for transport.\n\nC11 is calculated based on actual sales of gas to both end customers and wholesalers as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The different types of gas sold have specific upstream and downstream emission factors.\n\nThe subcategories C8, C10, and C12-C15 are not relevant for \u00d8rsted.\n\n## GHG emissions outside of scope 1-3\n\nCarbon emissions from burning biomass are net-zero for scope 1 emissions, according to the GHG Protocol, as the amount of carbon absorbed by the biomass during the growth phase is equivalent to the amount of carbon released through combustion. To ensure full transparency of all our activities, we document these emissions separately from the scopes, as recommended by the GHG Protocol. The direct biogenic carbon emissions are calculated by multiplying the volume of used biomass with the corresponding carbon emission factors.\n\n## GHG intensity (scope 1 and 2)\n\nThis is calculated as total scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions divided by total heat and power generation, revenue, and EBITDA, respectively.\n\n## GHG intensity (scope 1, 2, and 3)\n\nThis is calculated as total scope 1, scope 2 (market-based), and scope 3 (excluding natural gas sales) emissions divided by total heat and power generation.",

We depend on diverse, healthy ecosystems for the air we breathe, the food we eat, our economic prosperity, limiting climate change, and protecting those communities most at risk.\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we believe that the renewable energy transition can be part of a solution to the biodiversity crisis, provided we do it right. Achieving this requires that we first and foremost identify and proactively address the potential adverse effects that the buildout itself has on wildlife, habitats, and ecosystems.\n\nAs we continue our renewable energy build-out, we are determined to leave nature as a whole in a better state than we found it. Therefore, our ambition is to take direct action to be able to achieve a net-positive biodiversity impact in projects commissioned from 2030 onwards. We strive to optimise how we work with and integrate biodiversity protection and restoration into the way we develop, construct, and operate renewable energy projects.\n\nWe have established an offshore wind biodiversity policy addressing direct impacts from our operations\n\non biodiversity, ecosystem protection, and sustainable ocean practices. With accountability lying with the Head of Global Stakeholder Relations, the policy sets out the principles that underpin our efforts to  protect the natural environment in the areas where we construct and operate offshore wind farms. We will develop our biodiversity policy further to encompass all renewable energy technologies, both onshore and offshore. The revised policy is expected to be finalised in 2024.\n\nAs we develop, construct, and operate more renewable energy assets, we follow four core principles to effectively manage our impacts on biodiversity and work towards achieving a net-positive biodiversity impact for future projects:\n\n- 1 Science-based  decarbonisation Our biodiversity policy recognises the significant threat that climate change poses to biodiversity. To address the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change, we must shift away from fossil fuels and set science-based decarbonisation targets across the value chain (see section E1 on climate change).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Positive impacts\n\nSIGNIFICANT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiodiversity restoration, research, and innovation initiatives (OO)\n\n(OO)  Own operations\n\n(VC)  Value chain\n\n## Negative impacts\n\nCRUCIAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatural resources exploitation and land-use change from mining of minerals and metals (VC)\n\nHabitat loss from land degradation caused by mining of minerals and metals (VC)\n\nSIGNIFICANT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisturbances to habitats and displacement or loss of species (OO)",

Additionally, we prioritise reduction of any residual negative impacts. We ensure this through environmental and social impact assessments and studies, and through implementation of\n\ntechnologies for impact management, mitigation, and reduction. We actively expand our knowledge in these areas by addressing knowledge gaps and uncertainties to ensure we can deploy solutions that are based on the best available science, local expert knowledge, and the latest effective technological advancements.\n\n- 3   Set targets and deliver positive impacts To deliver on our 2030 ambition of achieving netpositive biodiversity impact, we depend on appropriate measurement and reporting frameworks. Our goal is to establish clear targets with specific, transparent, and recognised metrics. We are involved in the Science Based Targets Network's (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Program and have become Early Adopters of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), contributing to the development of a standardised methodology for assessing corporate-level impacts on nature.\n- We adopt a holistic approach, addressing ecological, climate, and social sustainability. This includes implementing the mitigation hierarchy, including delivering ecosystem-wide restoration projects where feasible, resource circularity (see section E5 on resource use and circular economy), and supporting local communities (see section S3 on affected\n- 4   Holistic sustainability action communities).\n\n## 2023 actions\n\nDuring the year, we have taken significant steps towards our 2030 ambition by following our four principles for a biodiversity-positive energy transition:\n\n- 1   Science-based decarbonisation\n- \u00b7 See section E1 on climate change.\n- 2   Avoid and mitigate negative impacts based on the best available science\n- \u00b7 As part of the ecological compensation measures for our offshore wind farm Hornsea 3, we have\n- started the work of providing artificial nesting structures for the kittiwake bird species along the east coast of England. The offshore artificial nesting structures are the first of their kind, and we are working on new and innovative designs for future structures. These nesting structures are needed to support this important and vulnerable species and will enable Hornsea 3 to be built and generate renewable electricity.\n- \u00b7 We have progressed research studies on critical environmental topics. For instance, we have developed a bat and bird monitoring guidance document to support protection of vulnerable bat and bird species in the acceleration of the offshore wind industry.\n- 3   Set targets and deliver positive impacts\n- \u00b7 We have continued the development of a measurement framework to assess biodiversity net gains and losses at our assets, utilising data from five operational assets for practical testing. In 2023, we successfully piloted this framework across renewable projects to evaluate its effectiveness in being able to report overall biodiversity impacts for future projects. The aim of the framework is to ensure consistency, transparency, and informed decision-making by having a standardised methodology with reliable data.\n- \u00b7 We have become Early Adopters of the TNFD Recommendations, and in 2023, we made our first TNFD-aligned disclosures. For more information, see our TNFD reference table in the appendix.",

        "page_content": "In addition, we have continued a strong collaboration with TNFD, SBTN, and other key stakeholders, aimed at facilitating the development of an industry standard. As part of these efforts, we have aligned our data collection approach to ensure our readiness for active participation once global frameworks are established. This will hopefully contribute to a higher level of comparability and credibility of biodiversity measurements in the renewable energy sector.\n\n- 4   Holistic sustainability action\n- \u00b7 On World Ocean Day, we became the first energy company in the world to issue blue bonds, with the aim of raising blue financing to increase investments that specifically target offshore biodiversity and sustainable shipping. This allows us to further incentivise biodiversity action as part of offshore wind development.\n- \u00b7 We have released a white paper titled 'Uniting action on climate and biodiversity.' This paper highlights the crucial role renewable energy plays in addressing both the climate and biodiversity crises. It emphasises the necessity of incorporating biodiversity considerations into renewable energy expansion and outlines the essential steps for achieving this goal. The paper is a call to action to policymakers and civil society to drive further progress in this field and build this into the development of future renewable targets.\n- \u00b7 We have taken steps to contribute to saving the cod stock in the Baltic Sea through a collaboration with BalticWaters and the ReCod project. The project involves releasing cod larvae in places where the cod previously spawned. The aim is to improve\n\nthe survival rate of cod and at the same time collect valuable data on how the cod stock can be strengthened in the Baltic Sea.\n\n- \u00b7 In collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, we have set out to protect almost 1,000 acres of threatened native prairie at our Mockingbird Solar Center in northeast Texas, US. Prairies are  valuable, productive ecosystems that provide numerous benefits, from flood prevention and water filtration to carbon storage. Native prairies provide habitat for populations of birds, monarch butterflies, bees, and other pollinators.\n- \u00b7 We have launched the BioReef marine restoration project in collaboration with WWF and DTU Aqua to contribute to ocean biodiversity in the Danish North Sea. The project aims to develop methods to establish biogenic reefs of European flat oysters and horse mussels. We hope that learnings from BioReef will inform best practices for global bivalve reef restoration.\n- \u00b7 We have initiated a biodiversity initiative near our onshore wind farm Sunflower Wind in Kansas, US, together with The Conservation Fund and The Nature Conservancy. This initiative will support habitat protection and restoration of up to 3,000 acres of tallgrass prairie near the wind farm.\n- \u00b7 We have launched a new research project at Anholt Offshore Wind Farm in Denmark together with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), with the purpose of growing less carbon-intensive foods while contributing to a healthier marine environment.\n- \u00b7 We continued our previously launched biodiversity pilot projects, including our large-scale restoration project in the Humber Estuary in the UK, our ReCoral project in Taiwan, our 3D-printed reef project in Denmark, and rewilding of ocean biodiversity through our partnership with ARK Nature.\n\n## Future actions\n\nIn the short term, we aim to integrate our biodiversity ambition and measurement framework into all upcoming renewable energy projects that will be commissioned from 2030 onwards, covering offshore wind, onshore wind, solar power, and P2X, alongside ongoing monitoring of our current and upcoming biodiversity initiatives.\n\nIn the future, we intend to ensure that every renewable energy project we commission delivers a netpositive impact through effective avoidance, minimisation, mitigation, and where required, offsetting of biodiversity impacts. We also aim to establish precise science-based and measurable biodiversity targets for our direct impacts. We will strive to fully integrate our biodiversity ambition into all facets of our business.\n\nWe have also begun the work of identifying our key impacts on biodiversity in our upstream value chain, e.g. by identifying which materials have the greatest impact on biodiversity. Going forward, we will work towards mapping out these impacts to a country level and cooperating with our suppliers on mitigating impacts on biodiversity.\n\n## Targets\n\nThrough our 2030 ambition, we work on being able to establish specific biodiversity targets. Substantial progress has been achieved through our biodiversity pilot projects and our development of a measurement framework, which has enhanced our understanding of how to improve biodiversity at the asset level.\n\nOur biodiversity efforts, ambition, and approach are influenced by various factors, including the EU's biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Global Biodiversity Framework, SBTN, TNFD, the EU Align project, and national legislation in the countries where we operate. We ensure alignment with these frameworks, and new regulations guide our continued development and engagement with biodiversity.",

Data is initially recognised from commercial operation date (COD).\n\nIn some markets, we install transmission assets for offshore wind farms, which include onshore and offshore export cables and substations. However, these usually have to be divested near to or at commissioning of the wind farm, as required by national legislation. Therefore, the data for export cables represents transmission assets not yet divested on some wind farms and does not include onshore parts of offshore wind farms.\n\n## Protected areas\n\nProtected areas and areas of high biodiversity value (key biodiversity areas) follow the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, disclosure 304-1. This includes the list of protected areas described, such as IUCN protected area management categories, the Ramsar Convention, and national legislation. The data points are the cumulative number of protected areas for nature conservation or key biodiversity areas, respectively, with which our operational sites interact.",

However, renewable energy supply chains are under pressure, and bottlenecks and material scarcities are already defining the pace of the energy transition in many markets. We can reduce some of these pressures through circularity efforts. By considering the provenance and mix of materials and increasing recycling and reusing, we can reduce the demand for virgin materials and reduce volatilities in our supply chain while minimising negative impacts throughout the value chain, including carbon emissions.\n\nThe dominant share of our upstream carbon emissions comes from the extraction and processing of  materials for our assets (approximately 75 %) - steel alone accounts for approximately 50 %. By incorporating circular principles across our business we can reduce carbon emissions to help reach our science-based netzero target while ensuring responsible waste management. We mainly work across three circularity levers:\n\n- 1   Circular design and materials We take measures to reduce and optimise resource usage by rethinking the design of our new renewable energy assets. We want to engage with key suppliers to promote the use of recycled and recyclable materials, particularly in high-impact categories like steel.\n- 2   Operations and late-life strategies We strive to maximise the value of our components and assets. We investigate opportunities for repairing, refurbishing, and reusing key components to prolong their lifetime, and we aim to extend the operational lifetime of our wind farms by up to 10 years, beyond the expected lifetime.\n- 3   Resource recovery and recycling Our ambition is to ensure that all materials, when they reach their end-of-life stage, can be effectively recovered and recycled into new supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Negative impacts CRUCIAL\n\n- 1 Use of virgin materials in our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsupply chain (VC)\n\nSIGNIFICANT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste generation during operation and decommissioning (OO)\n\n(OO)  Own operations\n\n- (VC)  Value chain\n\n## Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAvailability of materials and components (VC)",

        "page_content": "To support the promotion of circularity and waste management in our business, we have a resource management policy covering all \u00d8rsted activities and locations. The objective of the policy is to address our aim of minimising the use of virgin resources and to provide the direction for sustainable sourcing of resources. Accountability for our circularity efforts lies with our Chief Operating Officer.\n\n## 2023 actions\n\nDuring the year, we have taken significant steps by launching partnerships and initiatives for circularity and sustainable resource management, of which the most prominent are:\n\n- 1   Design and supply chain\n- \u00b7 We have partnered with Vestas and pledged to procure a minimum of 25 % wind turbine towers produced using scrap steel for all joint future offshore projects. These new towers will reduce the carbon footprint from offshore turbine towers with approximately 25 %. We have also pledged to procure blades made from recycled materials at all future joint offshore wind farms, when commercially available. This new blade technology addresses the industry's biggest circularity challenge, namely the many blades in operation today that need to be recycled at their end of life. With this pledge, we help scale the technology further.\n- \u00b7 Our co-founded industry-wide recycling project DecomBlades has achieved a significant development by extracting and processing glass fibres from old wind turbine blades. The extracted fibres maintain a quality that enables their reuse in the manufacturing of new blades. This breakthrough\n\nrepresents a crucial step in mitigating our industry's largest waste problem and advancing towards a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.\n\n- 2   Operations and late-life strategies\n- \u00b7 We have joined the Coalition for Wind Industry Circularity (CWIC) to contribute to the establishment of a circular supply chain focused on reusing and refurbishing old wind turbine components. The initiative aims to collaborate with industry peers and supply chain partners to develop capabilities for refurbishing and reusing wind turbine parts in the UK. Emphasising reuse and refurbishment can alleviate pressure on supply chains, decrease the carbon footprint of wind farms, and offer socio-economic benefits through the generation of new jobs.\n- \u00b7 We have formed a partnership with Renewable Parts, a specialist in supply chains and refurbishment within the wind energy industry. Through the optimisation of maintenance and parts supply, specifically by refurbishing our offshore wind turbines, our goal is to decrease costs, enhance availability levels of materials, and reduce the overall carbon footprint of wind farms.\n- 3   Resource recovery and recycling\n- \u00b7 We have entered a partnership with SOLARCYCLE, a technology-based solar recycling company, to handle the processing and recycling of end-of-life solar modules sourced from our projects throughout the US. This collaboration not only helps us divert materials from landfills but also ensures the recovery of high-value materials crucial to the green energy transition. By reintroducing these materials into our supply chain, we are actively contributing\n\nto a more sustainable and circular approach to managing solar technology waste.\n\n- \u00b7 Our commitment to achieving 100 % reuse and recycling of solar panels within our US portfolio has now been expanded to encompass our entire global portfolio. By proactively making this commitment, we are laying the groundwork for the early development of capabilities and the maturation of recycling markets.\n- \u00b7 We have entered into a partnership with Plaswire in Northern Ireland with the aim of maturing recyling solutions for onshore wind farms. In a pilot project initiated at our onshore wind farms Owenreagh 1 and 2, three blades were recycled by shredding and remoulding their materials for the production of construction materials. Beyond material reutilisation, this partnership is supposed to generate employment opportunities within the local communities.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we were part of DNV's pilot programme ReWind, a digital tool designed to evaluate material breakdown and circularity rates in decommissioned wind farms. We are confident that this industry-leading platform will assist us in accurately calculating the residual value of our assets and optimising the circularity of our projects.\n\n## Future actions\n\n- \u00b7 Moving forward, we will start engaging our key suppliers on circularity as part of our procurement processes with the goal of incentivising more circular methods in our supply chain.  Acknowledging the complexity of circularity in the renewable energy\n- industry, we will continue to seek out industrywide and cross-sector collaborations to achieve increased circularity.\n- \u00b7 As described in the 'Strategy and business'  section, we have ceased development of our offshore wind projects Ocean Wind 1 and 2 in the US. We are closely assessing whether and how components that have been fabricated for those projects can be reused or repurposed to preserve their material and financial value. This includes evaluating opportunities such as reusing components in other \u00d8rsted projects, or selling them for reuse or refurbishment to our suppliers or other developers in the industry.\n\n## Sustainable use of biomass\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nWe are committed to sourcing sustainable wooden biomass verified by independent third-party bodies. Biomass plays an important role in the Danish energy system, delivering efficient energy with a remarkable yield of up to 90 % when integrated into district heating. Furthermore, it serves as an alternative energy source during periods of suboptimal solar and wind conditions. While biomass is a renewable source, we recognise the need for responsible utilisation of biomass to ensure the preservation of its climate benefits.\n\nOur wooden biomass only originates from wellmanaged production forests with an ongoing reforestation effort. We only procure wood pellets and chips from residues and low-grade wood, typically sourced from sawdust, regular forest thinning, harvesting  residues, or diseased trees.",

Read more in the 'Strategy and business' section.\n\n## 2023 actions\n\n- \u00b7 We operate five combined heat and power (CHP) plants fuelled by biomass, providing district  heating and electricity to approximately 400,000 households.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, 94 % of our total biomass  consumption came from wooden biomass, of which 100 %\n\nwas certified sustainable wooden biomass, independently verified by FSC\u00ae, PEFC, or SBP, ensuring the origin of the biomass on an annual basis. In addition to the certification requirements, we maintain ongoing engagement with our biomass suppliers to ensure they align with our sustainability standards.\n\n- \u00b7 The remaining 6 % of our biomass came from residual straw sourced from Danish agriculture. While straw biomass lacks a specific certification scheme, our supplied straw is sourced as a waste product from local farms, preventing the disposal of the resource.\n\n## Future actions\n\nIn the future, we anticipate a reduction in our biomass usage as other renewable energy sources are expected to increase. Nevertheless, biomass will most likely continue to play a role in the Danish energy system, serving as a storable energy solution to complement solar and wind, as well as being employed in P2X to produce renewable hydrogen.\n\n## Responsible sourcing of minerals and metals\n\nOur renewable energy assets rely on various metals, including rare earth elements for wind turbine magnets, copper for transmission cables, and lithium for batteries. We have implemented activities to promote responsible supply chains for the key metals that fuel the renewable energy transition. For more information about our sourcing of minerals and metals, see section S2 on workers in the value chain.\n\n## Targets\n\nWe have a commitment to continue to use 100 % certified sustainable wooden biomass.\n\nWe commit to either reuse, recycle, or recover all of the wind turbine blades in our global portfolio of onshore and offshore wind farms. Similarly, we commit to reuse or recycle all solar panels from our global portfolio of solar farms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ban on landfilling\n\n- \u2192  Zero wind turbine blades to landfill\n- \u2192  Zero solar panels to landfill",

We started to send some of the wind turbine blades from the temporary storage to recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Waste by type and disposal method\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, disclosures 306-3, 306-4, and 306-5, have been used as guidance in developing the reported data points.\n\nWaste is generally reported on the basis of invoices received from waste recipients, supplemented with plant-specific measurement methods for commercial facilities, including construction activities.\n\nPart of the oil-contaminated wastewater from the North Sea oil pipeline has been treated as waste and therefore reported as waste and not wastewater.\n\nWaste treated at the Renescience plant, which converts household waste into biogas, recyclables, and waste fuel, is included as well as ashes from the combined heat and power (CHP) plants.\n\nResidual products, e.g. gypsum from the CHPs, which are not handled as waste but sold as products, are not included.\n\nSoil from excavation projects is not included.\n\nWind turbine blades taken down include all blades taken down due to decommisioning, repowering, or malfunctioning during their operational lifetime.",

All employees, contractors, suppliers, and business partners, as well as the communities affected by our operations, are covered by the policies.\n\nWe respect key international human and labour rights standards included in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our policy on human rights explicitly highlights our dedication to ensuring freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, elimination of forced or compulsory labour, effective abolition of child labour, and elimination of discrimination in\n\nemployment and occupation, among other critical issues. In our work with human rights, we are guided by the authoritative global frameworks, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nWe firmly believe that these principles are integral to fostering a just transition to green energy. Therefore, it is our priority to ensure that adequate management systems are in place to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remedy any potential adverse human rights impacts, whether they are related to our own workforce, value chain workers, or affected communities.\n\nIn cases where we identify potential adverse human rights impacts, we are committed to promptly and effectively providing and enabling remedies. Our grievance and remediation approach includes addressing any adverse human rights impacts on individuals, workers, and communities that we have caused or contributed to.\n\nFurthermore, we are dedicated to safeguarding the labour conditions of our employees through social protection. This encompasses support for circumstances such as sickness, unemployment, employment injury, parental leave, and retirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Positive impacts\n\nSIGNIFICANT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecure employment and flexible workplace for our employees\n\nDiversity resulting in innovative thinking and approaches\n\nCareer progression through training and development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecruiting and advancing women and under-represented groups, and working to ensure that they stay in \u00d8rsted\n\nInclusive culture where people with disabilities can thrive",

        "page_content": "We have established a global minimum standard of benefits for caregivers, irrespective of gender or marital status. In addition, we offer various other paid or unpaid family-related leaves, according to country provision and collective bargaining agreements, such as marriage leave, compassionate leave, childcare leave, and nursing care leave. We have a commitment to offer immediate assistance and financial security to employees facing severe illness, with a focus on facilitating a timely return to work.\n\nAligned with local practices, our basic insurance for unemployment and disability ensures equitable compensation. Retirement benefits are incorporated in our overall remuneration package, and, unless local laws dictate otherwise, all employees are enrolled in a pension scheme through their employment at \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Actions\n\n- \u00b7 We actively monitor compliance with internationally recognised human rights standards by continuously collecting information and engaging with our business partners to ensure timely identification and remedy of potential violations.\n- \u00b7 We conduct regular human rights impact assessments of our own operations, supply chain, and projects. The assessments involve interviews with employees, document and policy reviews, and discussions with rightsholders, stakeholders, and experts. These assessments guide the development and implementation of mitigating action plans, and we continually monitor their progress.\n- \u00b7 To foster a sustainable, safe, and inclusive working environment where all employees can thrive,\n\nwe are in the final stages of developing a new global labour and employment rights policy. This policy aims to enhance transparency for our employees by articulating our commitment to actively safeguarding labour, employment, and human rights standards within our own workforce.\n\n- \u00b7 We have launched a new internal global policy on parental leave with the purpose of supporting and including all types of family structures, irrespective of gender or marital status.\n\n## Health and safety\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we prioritise and protect the physical, social, and psychological safety of everyone in the workplace. We believe that personal health and wellbeing are fundamental drivers for living a balanced life where people can realise their potential. Therefore, it is fundamental to our operations that we have a robust health and safety management system in place and that we foster a culture that promotes our employees' health and safety.\n\nWe have established a policy for quality, health, safety, and environment (QHSE), setting the standards for how we protect and ensure the well-being of our employees and the sustainability of our operations. The policy covers all our employees and facilities, with accountability lying with our Head of QHSE. We aim to incorporate quality, health, safety, and environment in all our decisions and actions, and we have implemented workplace accident prevention procedures to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees.\n\nWe comply with various ISO standards, including ISO 9001 (quality management system), 14001 (environmental management system), and 45001 (occupational health and safety management system), to maintain a robust management system that aligns with international best practices.\n\nAdditionally, we have an internal policy on mental well-being for all employees, with a focus on enhancing the mental well-being of our workforce, mitigating mental strain, such as work-related stress and anxiety, and providing guidance to employees and leaders on addressing these concerns. We have a range of support systems and offer our employees a health insurance, including access to psychologists and other mental health professionals and crisis counsellors as well as support on topics such as stress, relationships, family issues, and lifestyle management. Accountability for our well-being lies with the Chief Human Resources Officer.\n\n## Actions\n\n- \u00b7 We are continuously working to preserve our robust health and safety record while expanding our business activities. This entails continuing preventive and mitigating efforts such as safety days, internal audits, inspections, personal risk dialogues, emergency drills, and safety trainings.\n- \u00b7 To foster a workplace where everyone feels empowered to voice their thoughts, share innovative ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of dynamic psychological safety workshops. The objective of these workshops is to cultivate a shared understanding and provide practical techniques for nurturing psychological\n\nsafety, with the ultimate goal of fostering an open, creative, and inclusive culture.\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to explore approaches to support our employees in leading fulfilling lives, both within and outside the workplace. This includes promoting greater flexibility in working conditions, employee benefits, revaluating expectations regarding the definition of a typical workweek, and upgrading office facilities.\n- \u00b7 We have rolled out a Fitness & Health for Frontliners project, which is an initiative designed to enhance the physical well-being of our workforce, boost their work ability, and proactively manage issues such as musculoskeletal concerns. The project includes a fitness testing protocol, upgrades to our on-site training facilities, the introduction of tailored physical exercise programmes, and optimisation of physical demands and ergonomics.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we recognise that diversity drives innovation and is essential for a thriving workplace. To support this, we have established a global diversity and inclusion policy covering all \u00d8rsted employees, including executive and managerial positions, and with accountability lying with our Chief Human Resources Officer. The policy is centred on three key pillars:\n\n- 1   Providing equal opportunities for all employees, emphasising recognition and respect for all individuals.",

We are dedicated to offering equal opportunities regardless of ethnic background, race, religion, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, outlook, or social status. For all employees across \u00d8rsted, we have set an ambition of having an equal gender distribution by 2030, i.e. at least 40 % women and 60 % men. We are committed to diversity in top management, and we are working towards increasing the share of women in executive and managerial positions through talent programmes and leadership training.\n\nWe have also established an internal policy on bullying, discrimination, and harassment outlining our commitment to providing an inclusive working environment with equal opportunities. Accountability for this policy lies with our Chief Human Resources Officer. Together, our policies describe commitments related to initiatives for people from vulnerable groups, such as inclusive recruitment and promotion, coaching, mentoring, and sponsorships. We adopted the UN's LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business in 2018, and we aim to support equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n## Actions\n\n- \u00b7 We have introduced an internal 'global accessibility toolkit' to assist employees and people leaders in enhancing the accessibility of our workplace for everyone. This toolkit offers guidance on physical\n\naccessibility, technology accessibility, and everyday behaviours that foster an inclusive environment for employees with disabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 We have continued working towards increasing the share of women in executive and managerial positions through targeted development programmes for female talents and our 'Female Spotlight Initiative', which prepares talented women for senior leadership positions.\n- \u00b7 We have implemented a new training programme that educates participants on creating an equitable and inclusive workplace. This programme includes quarterly trainings and a self-learning platform for continuous development.\n- \u00b7 We have continued our work with \u00d8rsted IN, a global hub for our inclusion networks with dedicated channels for anyone identifying with a specific group or serving as an ally supporting equality and inclusion. These networks provide psychologically safe communities for members to share ideas, seek advice, and learn about inclusion of diversity. Current active networks include Race and Ethnicity IN, Gender IN, Disability IN, LGBTQ+ IN, and 50+ IN, each working towards fostering inclusivity within \u00d8rsted.\n- \u00b7 We are committed to equal pay and have a constant focus on ensuring equal pay for equal positions and competences when hiring or promoting employees. To raise awareness, we conduct an annual gender pay gap report for all the countries where we operate with more than 250 employees. For more information, please see table 'Gender pay gap' on page 118.\n\n## Training and skills\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we are committed to cultivating and expanding a skilled workforce that can drive the global green energy transition. We firmly believe that for employees to thrive, perform effectively, and experience growth, it is essential for them to comprehend their role within the organisation and be aware of future opportunities that may arise.\n\nWe believe that we learn most effectively from experience and through interactions with other people. In \u00d8rsted, we have implemented the 70:20:10 learning model, meaning that approximately 70 % of our learning and development comes from experience, 20 % comes from working with others, and 10 % comes from training.\n\n## Actions\n\n- \u00b7 We are working on enhancing \u00d8rsted's career pathways to empower employees to take ownership of their career progression, supported by their leaders. Our goal is to facilitate competence growth and ensure fair access to career development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 We have implemented a global career map designed to assist employees in driving their own development by outlining pathways for career fulfilment. This map also serves as a shared framework for discussing aspirations with people leaders.\n- \u00b7 We have hosted career pathway webinars for employees and people leaders. These sessions aim to encourage better ownership of career development by utilising various tools, such as career cards.\n\nThese cards contain descriptions of the generic key competences required in each job, aiding employees in comparing roles across \u00d8rsted.\n\n- \u00b7 To live out our 70:20:10 learning model, we offer and encourage our employees to use a variety of solutions, including catalogues and tools for on-the-job learning, mentoring programmes, knowledge sharing, courses, workshops, e-learnings, and much more.\n\n## Engaging with our own workforce\n\nWe are committed to creating a culture where everyone feels psychologically safe to voice important matters. This includes encouragement to freely express views, also to colleagues in higher hierarchical positions.\n\nTo support this, we conduct an annual People Matter (satisfaction and motivation) survey globally, providing insights into employees' perceptions of \u00d8rsted as a workplace, daily work experiences, relationships with people leaders and senior management, and other factors impacting their working life. Survey results serve as a valuable foundation for initiating dialogue and identifying actions to further improve our workplace.\n\nAdditionally, we have established an easily accessible site on our company intranet that outlines various options for employee representation on both global and local levels. These include alternative channels for employees to voice their opinions, such as HR business partners, reporting systems, a whistleblower hotline, works councils, employment relations representatives, and personal development dialogues.",

It allows people to seek recourse and find a solution when they believe that their rights have been violated, promoting a more equitable and fairer workplace. If any employee feels they have experienced an instance of  bullying, discrimination, or harassment, they are encouraged to seek support. Employees can also make an  official report to their HR contact or  utilise \u00d8rsted's global whistleblower hotline. For more information on our whistleblower hotline and how we protect whistleblowers against retaliation, see section G1 on business conduct.\n\nWe take proactive steps to ensure that our employees are aware of and reminded about the grievance mechanisms available. This awareness is built into various aspects of our employee experience, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of conduct training: As part of our training programme, we include specific modules on our grievance and complaints handling policy.\n- \u00b7 Internal information campaigns:\n\nWe regularly communicate with our employees through various internal channels, including emails, newsletters, and our intranet, to remind them about the availability of grievance channels and encourage their use.\n\nWe are dedicated to ensuring that our employees not only have access to these channels but also have the knowledge, confidence, and psychological safety to utilise them when necessary. \u00d8rsted as an organisation has the responsibility to take all reported cases seriously and provide fair outcomes for investigated cases that take all parties' needs into consideration.

The number of employees is determined as the number of employees at the end of each month converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs). Employees who have been made redundant are recognised until the expiry of their notice period, regardless of whether they have been released from all or some of their duties during their notice period.\n\n## Sickness absence\n\nSickness absence is calculated as the ratio between the number of sick days and the planned number of annual working days.\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe employee turnover rate is calculated as the number of permanent employees who have left the company relative to the average number of permanent employees in the financial year.\n\n## Employee satisfaction survey results\n\n\u00d8rsted conducts a comprehensive employee satisfaction survey once a year. With a few exceptions, all \u00d8rsted employees are invited to participate in the survey. The following employees are omitted from the survey results: employees who joined the company shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, employees who resigned shortly after the employee satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisors, and external temporary workers who do not have an employment contract with \u00d8rsted.",

Both the proportion of women and men receiving bonus increased by 5 percentage points to 30 % and 33 %, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThe differences in pay and bonus between men and women are highly impacted by differences in gender mix across levels in the organisation, where there is a trend towards the share of women not increasing at the same pace in the higher-level leadership positions as we see in the remaining part of the organisation.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nConsists of members elected at the annual general meeting.

The reporting covers contractually employed employees in all \u00d8rsted companies. The number of employees is determined as the number of employees at the end of the financial year converted to full-time equivalents.\n\n## Gender pay\n\nOur gender pay reporting is inspired by the mandatory gender pay reporting requirements in the UK.\n\nCountries with more than 250 FTEs per country are included in the statement.\n\nThe salaries are reviewed annually and come into effect on 1 June. Countries with more than 250 FTEs on that day are included in the year's reporting.\n\nThe gender pay gap shows the pay gap between men and women without adjusting for other factors impacting pay levels (e.g. career level and work experience).\n\n## Definitions\n\nGender pay gap: The difference between the average earnings of women and men expressed as a percentage.\n\nGender bonus pay gap: The difference between the average bonus payments of women and men expressed as a percentage.\n\nGender bonus distribution: The percentage of men and women in the workforce who receive bonuses.",

This means that irrespective of our ownership share, we include 100 % of injuries, hours worked, etc. from all operations where \u00d8rsted is responsible for HSE safety, including the safety of our contractors.\n\nThe lost-time injury frequency (LTIF) is calculated as the number of lost-time injuries per one million hours worked. The number of hours worked is based on 1,667 working hours annually per full-time equivalent and monthly records of the number of employees converted into full-time equivalents. For suppliers, the actual number of hours worked is recognised on the basis of data provided by the suppliers, access control systems at locations, or estimates. LTIF includes lost-time injuries defined as injuries that result in an incapacity to work for one or more calendar days in addition to the day of the incident.\n\nTotal recordable injury rate (TRIR) is calculated in the same way as LTIF, but in addition to losttime injuries, TRIR also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as injuries where the injured person has received medical treatment.\n\nPermanent disability cases are injuries resulting in irreversible damage with permanent impairment which is not expected to improve.\n\nFatalities are the number of employees who lost their lives as a result of a work-related incident. Fatalities are included in both LTIs and TRIs.",

To support a just energy transition, we expect the companies we work with to run their business and supply chains in compliance with national laws and with respect for international labour and human rights standards. We need to make sure that we respect labour and human rights in everything we do and that we reduce the risk of people in our value chain being adversely impacted.\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we want to support a just transition through the creation of decent jobs in the renewable energy industry. This means jobs providing employees with decent wages, secure employment, safe working conditions, and a working environment where they are free to express their concerns and their right to organise in trade unions is protected.\n\nOur commitment to upholding human rights, including labour rights, is outlined in our sustainability commitment, global human rights policy, stakeholder engagement policy, just transition policy, and code of conduct for business partners. For more information on our policies and how they address human and labour rights impacts, see section S1 on our own workforce. For more information on our code of conduct, see section G1 on business conduct.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe aim at contributing to the creation of decent jobs in the renewable energy sector through our workforce development programmes and active engagement with value chain workers and trade unions. To take care of our value chain workers, we carry out a variety of actions and initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 We are collaborating with industry partners, associations, and unions to define quality standards for offshore wind jobs, creating opportunities for skilled workers and building an open, accessible sector.\n- \u00b7 We are actively involved in preparing workers for the demands of the industry. This involves training programmes for wind turbine technicians and apprenticeships targeted at young and seasoned professionals, with the goal of ensuring that they meet the highest standards for renewable energy development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Negative impacts\n\nSIGNIFICANT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExcessive working hours for supply chain workers\n\nForced labour, e.g. debt bondage and withholding of passports\n\n## Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuppliers' breach of contractual agreements on human rights commitments",

These teams have frequent on-site presence during the execution of contracts with our suppliers.\n- \u00b7 We have continued our work with industry peers to improve the rights and welfare of migrant workers in our supply chains, which is central to responsible business conduct and a just transition. As a first step, the companies drafted a set of principles and guidelines in consultation with suppliers and civil society organisations. The aim is to improve accommodation and transport for migrant workers, drive the employer pays principle, and implement effective grievance mechanisms. The next step is to pilot the principles and guidelines in fabrication yards in Singapore.\n- \u00b7 We have initiated a Respectful Working Environment campaign aimed at strategic vessel suppliers, with the aim of mitigating the risk of bullying and harassment in our offshore logistics supply chain. A key element of the campaign is to guide our suppliers on how to prevent, mitigate, and manage cases of bullying, discrimination, and harassment on board our contracted vessels. The format of the campaign not only raises awareness but also ensures that our offshore logistics suppliers are equipped with the necessary policies and procedures to foster a safe and respectful working environment for all crew members.\n\n## Responsible sourcing of minerals and metals\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nOur renewable energy assets are dependent on metals, including rare earth elements for wind turbine magnets, copper for transportation cables, and lithium for batteries. A significant share of these metals is mined in countries where the likelihood of adverse impacts on human and labour rights is high, and we must therefore do everything we can to avoid harmful effects. Therefore, we have a specific focus on striving to respect and protect the rights of workers and communities involved in the minerals and metals supply chain.\n\nOur efforts within sourcing of minerals and metals focus on the responsible supply chain of metals, acknowledging the challenges inherent in the mining industry's long and complex supply chains. We focus on ten key metals with the highest risk of adverse social and environmental impacts, operating through three strategic pillars:\n\n- 1   Supplier engagement We work closely with key suppliers, aligning with the OECD due diligence guidance on responsible mining. This involves assessing suppliers' management systems and supply chain risks and implementing response strategies.\n- 2   Supply chain transparency Addressing the challenge of transparency, we collaborate with first-tier suppliers and industry\n\npartners, exploring technological solutions to enhance traceability of supply chains for metals.\n\n- 3   Industry partnerships\n\nEngaging with multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and the International Responsible Business Conduct (IRBC) Agreement for the Renewable Energy Sector, we leverage partnerships to work on shared solutions to industry-wide impacts and risks.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2023, we continued our engagement with suppliers and industry associations, reinforcing our efforts of mapping our supply chains and enhancing our influence to mitigate social and environmental risks within our minerals and metals supply chain. Key initiatives include:\n\n- 1   Continued engagement with IRMA Building on our membership since the end of 2022 as the first renewable energy company, we actively participated in the Buyers Group alongside leaders in the automotive, electronics, and gemstone industries. This collaborative effort aims to collectively promote responsible supply chains of minerals and metals and advocate for ethical mining practices.\n- 2   Advancements in transparency We have started a pilot project applying blockchain technology to enhance the transparency of copper usage at one of our UK wind farms. Also, we have agreed with a supplier to initiate reporting on\n\nthe origin of steel used in foundations for upcoming\n\nprojects, a significant step towards increased transparency.\n\n- 3  Signing the IRBC for the Renewable Energy Sector We joined forces with other wind developers, industry partners, civil society, and  governmental stakeholders to address and mitigate risks and impacts on people and the environment in the operations and supply chains of the renewable energy sector. The aim of the agreement is to promote international responsible business conduct (IRBC), including collaborating with trade unions to address impacts on workers in our minerals and metals supply chain.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability, we plan to evaluate the results of our blockchain pilot in 2024, exploring potential applications to other suppliers and metals. Moving forward, we will also explore the reporting of the origin of steel for foundations and wind turbines with selected suppliers.",

As the primary form of engagement, we conduct worker interviews during on-site assessments. These assessments are performed for selected high-risk suppliers with a high presence of manual labour and are conducted through our regular supplier assessments, described in section G1 on business conduct.\n\nThrough these interviews, we strive to gain insights into the perspectives of workers who may be particularly vulnerable and marginalised, e.g. migrant workers and minorities. These interviews inform our ongoing collaboration with suppliers, guiding potential improvement activities that the supplier must work to implement in close partnership with \u00d8rsted.\n\nWe maintain a strong collaboration with trade unions and civic and non-governmental organisations in the regions where we operate, aiming to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce throughout our value chain. An example is our landmark project labour agreement with North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) - the National Offshore Wind Agreement (NOWA).\n\nThrough NOWA, we have implemented diversity targets, local training programmes, and performance monitoring for workforce diversity across all of \u00d8rsted's contractors and subcontractors involved in offshore wind farm construction in the US. This agreement also establishes project-specific workforce\n\nequity committees, which prioritise the recruitment and retention of individuals from communities of colour, women, gender-nonconforming individuals, and local environmental justice communities.\n\n## Remediation and channels to raise concerns\n\nOur approach to addressing concerns and grievances within our value chain is built on the principles of transparency, trust, and effective remediation that is proportionate to the grievance that has occurred. We are committed and continuously work to strengthen our processes for providing or helping to provide appropriate remediation to harmed workers in situations where we have identified that we have caused or contributed to a negative impact.\n\nFurthermore, through our code of conduct for business partners, we set clear expectations to our suppliers, emphasising the establishment of accessible grievance mechanisms for workers, rightsholders, and stakeholders. During our supplier due diligence procedure, we assess suppliers' management systems with a specific focus on their ability to meet these requirements. In cases where we identify shortcomings, we collaborate with our suppliers to develop improvement plans.\n\nAdditionally, workers in the supply chain have free access to and are encouraged to make use of the \u00d8rsted whistleblower hotline to confidentially report any inappropriate or illegal conduct. For more information on our code of conduct, whistleblower hotline, and how we protect whistleblowers against retaliation, see section G1 on business conduct.",

Accordingly, we acknowledge that the success of our business also relies on meaningful engagement with affected communities to foster local support and collaboration. By engaging communities in our projects and building them while being mindful of social impacts, we gain valuable insights into community needs, priorities, and local knowledge. These insights help ensure that our projects are not only environmentally sustainable but also socially sustainable.\n\nOur approach to managing our impacts on affected communities aims to avoid, mitigate, and remedy negative impacts and to create lasting positive impacts for affected communities. A key element of our approach is the recognition that our social impacts go beyond local content. We aim for positive impacts for affected communities to also materialise through biodiversity actions and local decarbonisation efforts, improving local air quality and public health.\n\nWe believe the industry should define a framework to measure what a people-positive project looks like, and we are currently taking the lead to achieve this.\n\nOur social value creation for affected communities centres on providing job opportunities and fostering skills development, innovation, and local supply chain growth. Due to our ambition to deliver a just and equitable transition, we are also actively exploring how to increase the participation and inclusion of especially disadvantaged groups in our engagement and benefit-sharing actions. Additionally, we are exploring deeper ways of strengthening community engagement, for example by offering co-ownership of our assets.\n\nOur commitment to uphold human rights of everyone and engage with communities is outlined in our sustainability commitment, global human rights policy, stakeholder engagement policy, just transition policy, and code of conduct for business partners.

Our current initiatives lay the foundation for integrating this approach across our business functions, markets, and asset projects. We work to go above the minimum regulatory requirements, believing that these actions are essential for securing and sustaining the social licence necessary for advancing renewable energy development.\n\nTo take care of affected communities, we have implemented a variety of actions and initiatives:\n\nInternal integration of standardised processes for monitoring and managing potential adverse human rights and social impacts\n\nWe are working towards establishing a consistent approach across our company for assessing and addressing human rights risks concerning local communities throughout the entire lifespan of a renewable energy project. Our initial focus involves the development and implementation of a global framework, comprised of three tools:\n\n- 1   Social and human rights impact assessments We have initiated the development of global guidance for asset-level social and human rights impact assessments. The purpose of the guidance is to create a standardised approach for conducting assessments before the construction of every new project, identifying and addressing potential human rights and social risks.\n- 2   Company-wide framework for managing community-level grievances We have initiated the development of a global standard for community feedback and grievance management. This will facilitate systematic tracking and response to community feedback and grievances and help us prevent or mitigate material negative impacts throughout the life cycle of an asset.\n- 3   Internal community engagement guidelines We are developing corporate-level guidelines to serve as a universal reference for adhering to\n\ninternational best practice standards on community engagement. Emphasising principles such as free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), these guidelines will have the aim of ensuring our commitment to ethical and respectful engagement, especially with Indigenous Peoples.\n\nCreating positive impact\n\n- \u00b7 We continued to work towards further increasing our positive social impacts on local socio-economic development, equity and inclusion,  environmental sustainability, and community empowerment through initiatives such as apprenticeship programmes, community benefit funds, local supplier development, sponsorships, and partnerships.\n- \u00b7 An example is our efforts in Korea, where we are developing co-prosperity programmes for the Incheon and Ongjin County communities after extensive consultation with affected stakeholders. The programmes will guide our relationship with the local communities going forward and include commitments to create a profit-sharing scheme with the local communities. They also include commitments to improve island community well-being by creating new business opportunities and promoting wind farm tourism as an additional source of livelihood.\n\nCommunicating our impacts\n\n- \u00b7 Pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act, we release a modern slavery act statement on an annual basis, addressing our modern slavery, human trafficking, and other human rights risks.\n\nDeveloping impact strategy and targets\n\n- \u00b7 We have initiated a new partnership with the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on defining the foundational elements for measuring the people-positivity of renewable energy projects.\n\n## Engaging with affected communities\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of engaging with affected communities to understand and address actual and potential impacts on them. Engagement occurs at various stages of the project development, construction, and operation through community liaison officers and project staff, employing different types and frequencies of interaction, such as public meetings and consultations, ensuring a dynamic and responsive approach to community needs.\n\nOur engagement approach is responsive to local social contexts, tailored to specific projects and areas. Our community liaison officers often come from the communities we engage with, helping us gain a profound understanding of the local contexts.\n\nWhen we develop new energy projects, we consider it our responsibility to assess the impact on local communities, and we consistently adhere to local regulations and guidelines in order to evaluate these projects' effects on the communities in which they are constructed. Therefore, we engage in early dialogue with local stakeholders to understand their perspectives on the project and its local impact.",

We have actively engaged with Indigenous communities in connection with projects both in the US and Australia. We try to begin conversations early in the development process, aligning with Indigenous Peoples' expectations and wishes. Our goal is to secure free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) for projects impacting Indigenous lands or territories, respecting their cultural, intellectual, religious, and spiritual property.\n\n## Remediation and channels to raise concerns\n\nWe work actively to improve our abilities to address and remedy negative impacts on communities affected by our operations. Through engagement via community liaison officers, we are able to actively collect feedback and grievances at the local asset level, particularly during the execution phase. We employ various methods, including hosting town halls and open forums and setting up post boxes to collect and address concerns on an ongoing basis. Also, our whistleblower hotline allows all individuals in affected communities to confidentially report   inappropriate or illegal conduct. For more information on our whistleblower hotline and how we protect whistleblowers against retaliation, see section G1 on business conduct.\n\nWe have implemented tailored solutions for different markets to address concerns from local communities and provide remedy. Notably, in instances where fishers have been adversely affected during the construction and operation of our offshore wind farms, we have taken measures to provide proportional remedies. Going forward, our efforts to establish a common standard for community feedback and grievance management will strengthen and systematise our processes for receiving, addressing, resolving, and providing remedy to affected communities where necessary.\n\n- \u2191  Our offshore wind farm technicians preparing for a day out on the turbines in Taichung, Taiwan.",

For high-risk partnerships, such as M&As, joint ventures, and similar, we perform a comprehensive partner due diligence, which also encompasses sustainability, creditworthiness, and branding assessments.\n\nThrough the KYC process, we conduct thorough investigations of our business partners to prevent, detect, and address allegations or incidents of corruption and bribery within \u00d8rsted. Our policies regarding sponsorships, donations, gifts, and entertainment are rigorously enforced and monitored through an online tool.\n\nIn addition to our policy on good business  conduct, KYC process, trainings, whistleblower hotline, and supplier due diligence, our Internal Audit team conducts regular audits to assess the  effectiveness of our anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures. Internal Audit acts as an autonomous function, reporting directly to the Audit & Risk Committee, and is not involved in day-to-day management affairs. This  separation aims to ensure impartiality and integrity  of  investigations.\n\nAdditionally, we prepare an annual internal fraud risk report, which analyses potential corruption and bribery risks within \u00d8rsted. This report aids in our ongoing efforts to prevent and address such incidents.\n\n## Management of relationships with suppliers\n\nWe believe in collaborative partnerships, expecting business partners to actively participate in risk assessments, inspections, monitoring, and reporting. Our Responsible Business Partners Programme engages and collaborates with suppliers and business partners on improving their adherence to our social, environmental, and ethical expectations. Our work is based on a systematic and risk-based due diligence process used to assess partners' and suppliers' adherence to our code of conduct for business partners.\n\nThe code of conduct is an integral part of our corporate strategy and agreements with our business partners, covering all suppliers, joint venture partners, and counterparties. We ensure a strong commitment to our code of conduct by incorporating it into all contracts with our business partners and suppliers. In addition to the principles of our code of conduct, we have commenced the incorporation of climate requirements into contractual agreements with key suppliers, which entails reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), setting science-based climate targets, and covering electricity consumption with renewable electricity.\n\nOur strategy to manage relationships with our suppliers is guided by a deep understanding of the potential\n\nsustainability risks within our supply chain. To evaluate performance and identify any gaps or adverse impacts, we employ a combination of risk screenings, extended risk screenings, and code of conduct assessments, which may occur both before and after contract signing. This process evaluates suppliers' adherence to our code of conduct and integrates with our global procurement system, encompassing four key steps for real progress and continuous improvement:\n\n- 1   Commitment Upon entering a contract with \u00d8rsted, suppliers sign\n\nand thereby commit to our code of conduct.\n\n- 2   Risk screening\n\nBased on country risk, category risk, and spend, we prioritise business partners for further engagement.\n\n## 3  Assessment\n\nWe evaluate whether business partners adhere to the expectations in our code of conduct, reviewing relevant management systems and practices.\n\n## 4   Improvement\n\nIn cases where gaps are identified, we collaborate with business partners to devise an improvement plan followed by regular touch points to ensure the effective implementation of the plan. In cases where we identify that business partners intentionally fail or repeatedly neglect the improvement plans, we reserve the right to terminate business relationships with the partner in question.\n\nIn 2023, we evaluated our due diligence approach, and in 2024, we will implement an updated process focusing on assessing high-risk suppliers prior to\n\ncontract signing independent of the risk of the project location. This commitment to continuous improvement is underscored by regular updates to our  internal risk scoring and the incorporation of evolving standards into our screening tools. As we navigate the dynamic landscape of due diligence, our goal is to meet the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethical conduct.",

Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct through our whistleblower scheme or our management system.\n\nIn 2023, 18 substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistleblower scheme. Nine cases related to good business conduct policy violations, while six cases concerned the workplace environment, one case concerned IT security, and two cases were classified as 'other'. None of the reported cases were critical to our business or caused adjustments to our financial results. One case required a police report.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Whistleblower cases\n\n\u00d8rsted's whistleblower hotline is available for internal and external reporting of suspected cases of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. Whistleblower cases are received and handled by the Internal Audit function, which also receives similar reports through the management system and from compliance officers.\n\nAll reports are managed in accordance with the guidelines for the handling of whistleblower reports approved by the Audit & Risk Committee, which is ultimately responsible for the whistleblower scheme. Only cases which are closed during the financial year, and which have been reported to the Audit & Risk Committee as fully or partially substantiated, are reported.\n\n## Course in good business conduct\n\nThe number of employees who have completed a course in good business conduct is calculated as the proportion of employees who, as of 31 December, have completed an e-learning course in good business conduct relative to the number of employees invited to take the course.",

The number of extended risk screenings decreased by 22 % to 62 due to a large number of recurring suppliers having been previously assessed.\n\nProcurement spend that is risk-screened decreased by 7 percentage points to 78 % in 2023, mainly because there has been some spend in 2023 on suppliers riskscreened before 2022 who are not in scope of our 2023 reporting.\n\nThe number of know-your-counterparty (KYC) screenings, focusing on suppliers' integrity and legal compliance, increased by 2 % in 2023. The increase reflects\n\nthe additional focus on KYC-screening compliance during 2023 and is in line with expectations.\n\nThe number of code of conduct (CoC) desktop assessments increased by 15 % in 2023, primarily due to the introduction of new suppliers in countries associated with higher CoC risks. The number of CoC site assessments increased to 9 in 2023 from 3 in 2022 due to an increased number of supplier pre-qualifications as well as the introduction of new high-risk category suppliers in high-risk markets.\n\nThe number of health, safety, and environment (HSE) desktop assessments decreased by 22 % in 2023 due to the implementation of new sourcing and supplier selection processes. The number of site assessments increased by 24 % in 2023 due to a stronger focus on supplier performance on site.\n\nThe number of desktop vessel inspections decreased by 33 % in 2023 due to a slowdown of project activities in APAC, where the majority of desktop assessments were performed. The number of physical vessel inspections increased by 14 % in 2023 due to an increase in project activities in the US Northeast and in Germany, where we have commenced the construction of our offshore wind farms Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3.\n\nThe results from the assessments are managed throughout the different programmes, and improvement plans are developed and implemented in collaboration with the suppliers.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nThe number of supplier risk screenings and due diligence activities conducted is determined by the time schedule of the individual construction projects and the procurement priorities from year to year.\n\n## Risk screenings\n\nThe Responsible Business Partners Programme (RPP) team applies a risk-based due diligence framework to identify areas within our code of conduct (CoC) for business partners where suppliers need to improve adherence to the code.\n\nRisk screenings are conducted by the RPP team on all new sourcing contracts above DKK 3 million based on country and category risk. Based on the risk screening evaluation, the RPP team conducts extended risk screenings of selected contracts with additional risk parameters, including labour characteristics related to e.g. migrant workers' and seafarers' rights. Screenings and extended screenings also take place for suppliers of coal and sustainable biomass as well as top-spend suppliers. Riskscreened procurement spend is also calculated annually.\n\nThe Business Ethics Compliance (BEC) team conducts know-your-counterparty (KYC) screenings of all new suppliers and business partners to ensure legal compliance.\n\n## Due diligence activities conducted\n\nDue diligence activities are carried out by our RPP, Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), and Marine Inspection teams based on the results of individual screenings and risk assessments.\n\nThe activities are conducted either as desktop assessments or inspections or as on-site assessments or physical inspections, which often include a visit to the production facilities by \u00d8rsted or a third party.\n\nAssessments also include potential suppliers (i.e. no signed contracts yet) as part of the tender process.",

This includes:\n\n- - Withdrawal for process use (boilers, flue gas cleaning, fly ash management, etc.) - Withdrawal for conversion to steam or hot\n- water and resale to business partners\n- - Withdrawal for offices and other buildings\n\nThe total volume of water withdrawal is measured based on meter readings or invoices from suppliers. Surface water and seawater is used for cooling at the combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Produced water is water extracted as part of the processing of wood chips and used instead of third-party water.\n\n## Freshwater withdrawal intensity\n\nFreshwater withdrawal intensity is calculated as freshwater withdrawal (surface water, groundwater, and third-party water) per unit heat and power generation.\n\n## Water stress\n\nWater stress is measured at site level. The methodology used to assess water stress is WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. The calculated output is \u00d8rsted's total withdrawal of water from water-stressed areas. Only groundwater and third-party water is included.\n\n## Wastewater discharge\n\nWastewater includes all planned and unplanned discharges of water from \u00d8rsted. For facilities, wastewater discharges are recorded based on meter readings. Where wastewater is removed by road tanker, discharges are based on invoices. For offices and warehouses, wastewater discharges are presumed to be equivalent to water consumption.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nWater consumption is calculated as water withdrawal minus wastewater discharges\n\n## Other air emissions: nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)\n\nNO x and SO 2 emissions are only reported for CHPs. NO x and SO 2 emissions from other combustions are not included. NO x and SO 2 are primarily measured by continuous measurement, but may also be based on plant-specific emission factors.\n\n## Environmental incidents\n\nAn environmental incident is an unintended incident which has a negative impact on the environment. We report environmental incidents using operational scopes, such as safety incidents. We register all environmental incidents at facilities where we are responsible for operations in terms of environmental management.\n\nThe materiality of an incident is determined on the basis of an assessment of the extent of, the dispersion to, and the impact on the environment. On this basis, all environmental incidents are categorised on a scale from 1 (slight impact) to 5 (massive impact). Actual incidents in categories 4 (major impact) and 5 (massive impact) are reported.\n\n## Avoided emissions from green bond proceeds\n\nAvoided emissions from allocated green bond proceeds are calculated on the assumption that the generation from wind and solar farms replaces an equal quantity of power generated using fossil fuels. Emissions from operation of these renewable assets are assumed to be zero.\n\nThe avoided emissions from green bond proceeds are calculated as the wind or solar farm's generation multiplied by an emission factor the average emissions of electricity produced from fossil fuels at the specific geographical local of the asset. The emissions factor takes into account the weighted mix of oil, coal, and natural gas.\n\nThe annual energy generation from projects in operation and projects under construction, as well as the resulting avoided emissions, are total figures for the projects (not adjusted for \u00d8rsted's ownership share).",

The gain of DKK 4,143 million transferred to the income statement mainly consists of gains related to the hedging of power.\n\n## Exchange rate adjustments\n\nIn 2023, foreign exchange gains relating to net investments in foreign enterprises amounting to DKK 548 million were primarily attributable to an increase of 3 % in the GBP exchange rate, partly countered by a decrease of 3 % in the USD exchange rate and a decrease of 3 % in the NTD exchange rate. A part of the net investment was hedged.",

Trade payables relating to purchases of intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment are not recognised in 'Change in trade payables'.\n\n'Change in tax equity liabilities' relates to cash contributions from tax equity partners and repayment hereof through production tax credits (PTCs), investment tax credits (ITCs), and other tax attributes to tax equity partners. See also note 3.9 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\n'Cash flows from investing activities' comprise payments in connection with the purchase and sale of non-current assets and enterprises as well as the purchase and sale of  securities that are not recognised as cash and cash equivalents.\n\n'Cash flows from financing activities' comprise changes in the size or composition of equity and loans, including instalments on leases and net proceeds related to interest-bearing tax equity liabilities. Proceeds from the raising of shortterm repo loans are presented net.\n\nCash flows in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the average exchange rates for the month in question, unless these differ significantly from the rates at the transaction date.",

We  provide a more detailed description of the accounting policies applied in the specific notes. Key accounting estimates and judgements as well as new and amended IFRS standards and interpretations are discussed in detail later in this note.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS  Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven).\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently in the financial year and for comparative figures, except for one change in accounting policy - see below.\n\n## Change in accounting policy\n\nFrom gross to net presentation of revenue and cost of sales from power trading activities.\n\nWe have changed our accounting policy regarding presentation of revenue and related costs from the settlement of failed own-use power contracts. These are contracts settled with delivery of physical power where the purpose of entering into them are hedging or optimisation of our revenue. Previously,\n\nwe recognised revenue and the cost of sales on a gross basis when these contracts were settled. As the gross presentation does not reflect the magnitude of the Group's power trading activities, we have changed the presentation to a net presentation of revenue and related costs. It is management's view that such  presentation better reflects the power trading  activities.\n\nThe change only impacts revenue and the cost of sales in the Offshore segment, and thus our EBITDA is not impacted.\n\nThe 2022 comparisons have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe impact on our 2023 and 2022 numbers is illustrated in the table to the right.\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for derivatives, gas in non-Danish storage facilities, financial instruments in the trading portfolio, and carbon emission allowances in the trading portfolio, which are measured at market value.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of \u00d8rsted A/S (the parent company) and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S.

Enterprises that satisfy the criteria for joint control are accounted for as investments in joint ventures, unless the nature of the joint arrangement is considered a joint operation.\n\nOur shares in joint operations are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the Group's own assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions between fully consolidated enterprises and joint operations is eliminated.",

Receivables, payables, and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and on the date at which the receivable or payable arose is recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries, joint operations, associates, and joint ventures are translated into DKK at monthly average exchange rates insofar as these do not deviate materially from the actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. Balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nAll exchange differences are recognised in profit (loss) for the year, except for exchange differences arising on:\n\n- \u00b7 translation of the opening equity of these entities at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date\n- \u00b7 translation of the statements of comprehensive income of these enterprises from 'the average-forthe-month exchange rates' to 'the exchange rates on the balance sheet date'\n- \u00b7 translation of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment\n- \u00b7 translation of the portion of loans and derivatives that has been entered into to hedge the net investment in an enterprise, and that provides an effective hedge against corresponding foreign exchange gains (losses) on the net investment.\n\nThe above types of exchange differences are recognised in 'Other comprehensive income'. Such exchange rate adjustments are divided between the equity of the parent company and the equity of the noncontrolling interests.\n\nOn full or partial divestment of the net investment, the accumulated exchange rate adjustments are recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Disposal resulting in loss of control: The accumulated exchange rate adjustments, including any associated hedges, are recognised in the profit (loss) for the year if a foreign exchange\n\ngain (loss) is realised by the selling enterprise. Any foreign exchange gain (loss) is transferred to the item in which the gain (loss) from the disposal is recognised. The part of the foreign currency translation reserve that relates to non-controlling interests is not transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n\n- \u00b7 Disposal not resulting in loss of control: A proportionate share of the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred from the parent company shareholders' share of equity to the minority shareholders' share of equity.\n\nRepayment of balances that are considered part of the net investment does not constitute a partial disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nWe are required to file our annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') using the XHTML format and to tag the consolidated financial statements, including notes, using the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created.\n\nThe annual report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a ZIP file named Orsted-2023-12-31-en.zip.\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nWe present financial measures in the consolidated financial statements to describe the Group's financial performance, financial position, and cash flows. We use these financial measures as we believe they provide valuable information to our stakeholders and management.\n\nThe financial measures should not be considered a replacement for the performance measures as defined under IFRS, but rather as supplementary information.\n\nThe financial measures may not be comparable to similar titled measures presented by other companies, as the definitions and calculations may be different.\n\nThe financial measures most commonly presented in the \u00d8rsted annual report are:\n\n- \u00b7 EBITDA and EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees\n- \u00b7 funds from operations (FFO)\n- \u00b7 adjusted interest-bearing net debt\n- \u00b7 free cash flow (FCF)\n- \u00b7 ROCE.\n\nOur definitions of the financial measures are included in note 7.3 'Non-IFRS financial measures'.",

None of them required a change in our accounting policies.\n\n## New standards and interpretations\n\nIASB has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2023. \u00d8rsted expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations as they become mandatory, except for the early implementation of the new disclosures to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 'Supplier Finance Arrangements'. See note 3.7 'Supply chain finance'.\n\nThe new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nGiven the uncertainties inherent in our business activities, we make a number of estimates and judgements. The estimates and judgements are based on assumptions concerning future developments, which affect our application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, sales, costs, cash flows, hedge reserves, and related disclosures. Actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated and judgements made, as more detailed information becomes available.\n\nWe regularly reassess these estimates and judgements based on, among other things, historical experience, the current situation in the financial  markets, and a number of other relevant factors, e.g. the updates in annual estimated production. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nAccounting estimates, judgements, and assumptions which may entail a risk of material adjustments in subsequent years are listed in the table above.\n\nIn addition, we make judgements when we apply the accounting policies.\n\nReference is made to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as the assumptions applied.\n\n- \u2191   Key accounting estimates and judgements and their level of potential impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe impact relates to objectivity and business practice.\n\n- Very objective/market-conforming\n- Objective/partially conforming\n- Partially subjective/partially distinctive\n- Subjective/distinctive to \u00d8rsted",

The decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower power and gas prices across all markets as well as lower volumes of gas and power sold.\n\nRevenue from construction agreements was DKK 6,737 million, mainly relating to the construction of Borkum Riffgrund 3 for partners and the divestment of the Hornsea 2 transmission asset.\n\nIn 2022, revenue from construction agreements mainly related to the farm-down of 50 % of the  Hornsea 2 offshore transmission asset and the contruction of Greater Changhua 1 for partners.\n\nIncome from government grants increased in 2023 due to power prices being below subsidy prices, leading to a higher subsidy per MWh produced.\n\nOn 1 January 2023, we changed our accounting policy with respect to presentation of revenue and related costs from the settlement of failed own-use power contracts.

For these types of goods and services, we recognise the revenue that corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Order backlog\n\n| DKKm                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| 31 December           | 6,538  | 5,989  |\n| Within one year       | 99 %   | 43 %   |\n| In more than one year | 1 %    | 57 %   |",

        "page_content": "## Revenue\n\nNote 2.2 - continued\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer (transaction price) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, i.e. VAT. We recognise revenue when we transfer control over a product or service to a customer or a partner.\n\nIf a part of the transaction price is variable, i.e. bonus payments, incentive payments for unmissed deadlines, etc., the variable consideration is recognised in revenue when it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWe adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if the payments exceed twelve months.\n\n## Generation of power\n\nGeneration of power is the sale of power produced at our own wind farms, solar farms, and power stations as well as the sale of ancillary services. We recognise revenue as the power is produced, since this is when delivery to the customers occurs.\n\nFees for having CPH plants on standby or ready to increase or decrease the generation of power to balance the demand and supply in the system is considered one performance obligation fulfilled over time.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nSale of power includes revenue from the sale of power sourced from other producers. This includes the sale of power sourced from investor power purchase agreements, thirdparty balancing contracts, exchanges, and\n\nother sales contracts. The sale is recognised when the power is delivered to the grid.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for long-term agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## Revenue from construction of wind farms\n\nRevenue from construction of wind farms includes development and construction. The construction agreements cover the construction phase from design to delivery of an  operational asset. The agreement consists of two performance obligations:\n\n- \u00b7 Wind farms.\n- \u00b7 Offshore transmission assets, if applicable.\n\nThe construction agreements cover our partners' shares of the construction of the wind farm and offshore transmission assets, if applicable. If our contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost-plus margin.\n\nWe recognise revenue over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation because the customer gains\n\ncontrol of the wind farm during the construction process. The input method reflects the ongoing transfer of control.\n\nThe consideration for the construction of an offshore wind farm consists of a fixed fee and a relatively minor variable fee, depending on when the wind farm can be put into operation. The consideration for an offshore transmission asset is a fixed fee.\n\nAfter signing the construction agreement, we carry out an assessment determining when the wind farm is expected to be completed. We calculate the size of the variable payment on this basis. We only recognise the variable fee when it is highly probable that a subsequent reversal will not take place.\n\nOur partner pays the fixed consideration based on a payment schedule. The payment schedule is determined and based on the expected progress of the construction and transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## Generation and sale of heat and steam\n\nHeat is sold under long-term heat contracts and recognised when the heat is delivered to our customer.\n\nThe individual heat customer has made a prepayment to finance the majority of our CAPEX associated with the biomass conversion of the CHP plant. The prepayment is recognised as a contract liability, and it is also recognised as revenue in step with the transfer of heat to the customer.\n\nPayment for the sale of heat consists of fixed costs associated with operations and maintenance of a CHP plant, fuel costs for the generation of heat, and a financial return. The consideration is due when delivered.\n\n## Sale of gas\n\nSale of gas is our gas sourced from other producers, and it is recognised when the gas is transferred to our buyer. The transfer of control occurs either when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of gas at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice. Some long-term gas sales contracts include clauses which give the right to renegotiate the fixed sales prices. Expectations for the outcomes of renegotiations are not included in revenue before we know the outcome of the individual renegotiations.\n\nThe consideration for the gas is due when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\n## Distribution and transmission\n\nFees for distribution and transmission of oil is recognised when the oil is delivered to the buyer, or when the capacity is made available.\n\nRevenue is calculated as the amount to which we are entitled when the service is delivered to the customer, and consideration is payable when invoiced.\n\n## O&M and other services\n\nRevenue from providing services is recognised over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided.\n\nFor fixed-priced contracts, revenue is recognised based on the actual service rendered at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be rendered. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total labour hours expected.\n\nFixed-price contracts are invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced. Variable fee services are due after the services are rendered.",

We treat the subsidies as a government grant, as it is paid by the Danish state.\n\nIn the UK, we receive subsidies under two schemes: contracts for difference (CfD) and the Renewable Obligation scheme (renewable obligation certificate (ROC) regime). The Burbo Bank Extension, Walney Extension, and Hornsea 1 offshore wind farms are under the CfD regime, while our other UK wind farms are entitled to ROCs. We treat the payments from the schemes as government grants.\n\nFeed-in tariffs from our Irish, French, Dutch, and German wind farms are also recognised as government grants.\n\nFor subsidies in the US, see note 3.9 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\nIncome from government grants increased in 2023 due to power prices being below subsidy prices, leading to a higher subsidy per MWh produced.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nGovernment grants comprise grants for environmentally sustainable power generation, grants for the funding of development projects, investment grants, etc.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received.\n\nAs grants for power generation are intended as a compensation for the price of power, we systematically recognise the grants under revenue in step with the power generation and thus the related revenue.\n\n## Research and development expenditures\n\nNote 2.5\n\n| Expensed research and development expenditures 2023 DKKm   | Offshore  1   | Onshore   | Bioenergy  & Other   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|---------|\n| Research                                                   | 239           | -         | -                    | 239     |\n| Development                                                | 1,606         | 460       | 1                    | 2,067   |\n| Total                                                      | 1,845         | 460       | 1                    | 2,306   |\n| Expensed research and development expenditures 2022 DKKm   |               |           |                      |         |\n| Research                                                   | 122           | -         | -                    | 122     |\n| Development                                                | 1,736         | 266       | 10                   | 2,012   |\n| Total                                                      | 1,858         | 266       | 10                   | 2,134   |\n\n- 1 In 2023, development expenditures in Offshore include P2X development costs of DKK 338 million (2022: DKK 159 million).\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nResearch costs are costs incurred to find new or improve existing technologies (e.g. improving offshore foundations, optimising the blade stability and performance of wind farms, and developing new ways of converting renewable electrons to renewable molecules and synthetic fuels).\n\nResearch costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs primarly comprise salaries (presented in Note 2.7 'Employee costs') as well as internal and external costs, which can be directly or indirectly attributed to design and development of offshore and onshore wind farms, solar farms, P2X production facilities, and energy storage facilities.\n\nDevelopment costs are expensed until the capitalisation  criteria are met. Development costs incurred after that are capitalised as 'Property, plant, and equipment under construction' (see note 3.1 'Intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment').",

In 2022, 'Gain on divestments of assets' related to the 50 % farm-downs of Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3.\n\n'Other compensation' was primarily compensations regarding outages and curtailments from TenneT, the German grid operator, and compensations from US operating asset performance guarantees.\n\n'Miscellaneous operating income' primarily related to adjustment of provisions toward partners.\n\n## Other operating expenses\n\n| DKKm                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cancellation fees                 | 9,621  | -      |\n| Ineffective hedges, etc.          | 512    | 4,591  |\n| Loss on divestment of assets      | 150    | 133    |\n| Miscellaneous operating  expenses | 125    | 239    |\n| Total                             | 10,408 | 4,963  |\n\n## Other operating expenses\n\n'Cancellation fees' amounted to DKK 9,621 million and related to the decision to cease the development of Ocean Wind 1.\n\nCosts related to fulfilling and cancelling contracts on Ocean Wind 1 were recognised as 'Cancellation fees' when the obligation arose, and to the extent these exceeded the provision for onerous contracts made as part of the impairment losses recognised in our interim report for the first nine months of 2023. Adjustments to this provision will be recognised in 'Other operating expenses' as 'Cancellation fees'.\n\nSee note 3.10 'Provisions and contingent liabilities' for more information about the cancellation fees and provisions made in relation to this.\n\n'Ineffective hedges' in 2023 mainly related to hedges, which we cannot document as being 'effective' from a hedge accounting perspective. In 2022, we also had volume-ineffective hedges.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nGains from farm-downs of ownership interests in wind farms are recognised on the divestment date as other operating income.\n\nGains from future construction of the partner's share of the wind farm are recognised over time in the income statement in step with construction. See notes 2.2 'Revenue' and 3.5 'Contract assets and liabilities'.\n\nThe accounting policies for the income from 'US tax credits and tax attributes' are described in note 3.9 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\nLosses from our market trading activities are presented as other operating expenses under 'Ineffecive hedges, etc.'.\n\n## Divestment of ownership interests in our offshore wind farms\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm to a partner, we typically also enter into agreements on the construction and future operation of the offshore wind farm.\n\nContracts in connection with a divestment are typically agreements on:\n\n- \u00b7 the sale of shares (divestment of assets) (SPA)\n- \u00b7 the future construction of the offshore wind farm (construction agreements or construction management agreements, if not in operation)\n- \u00b7 the future operation of the offshore wind farm (O&M agreements).\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Variable selling price related to divestments of offshore wind farms and offshore transmission assets\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm and an offshore transmission asset to a partner, we consider all terms and activities in the contracts in order to determine the transaction price.\n\nIf the consideration includes a variable amount, we estimate the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for transferring the asset, the wind farm, and the transmission asset to our partner.\n\nThe variable considerations are estimated at contract inception based on future outcome of events, e.g.:\n\n- \u00b7 the divestment price of the offshore transmission asset through a competitive tender process\n- \u00b7 the impact on production from future wind farms\n- \u00b7 the winning bid of the tender revenue stream through a competitive tender process.\n\nWe consider 'the most likely amount' to provide the most appropriate estimate of the expected variable consideration.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Classification of divestment\n\nWhen we divest ownership interests in an offshore wind farm, we carry out an individual assessment, determining whether the divestment qualifies as a divestment of an enterprise or a divestment of assets. We have typically assessed that the offshore wind farms do not constitute an enterprise, as no employees are transferred, and processes are transferred to a limited extent only.\n\n## Consolidation method for partnerships\n\nOn establishment of partnerships and in connection with any restructuring of existing partnerships, we assess whether the structure is a joint arrangement under shared control. For joint arrangements, we subsequently assess whether they are joint ventures or joint operations.\n\nIn assessing joint operations, we look at:\n\n- \u00b7 the corporate form of the operation\n- \u00b7 whether we are only entitled to the net profit (loss) or to income and expenses resulting from the operation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the parties buy or are assigned all output, for example the power generated, will lead to the structure being considered a joint operation if we have joint control.",

The decrease is due to the change in composition of the executive board.\n- 2 Other members of the Group Executive Team in 2023 were: Olivia Breese, Andrew Brown (joined on 14 November 2023), Rasmus Errboe (until 14 November 2023 when he joined the Executive Board), Anders Zo\u00ebga Hansen, David Hardy, Richard Hunter (left on 14 November 2023), Per Mejnert Kristensen, Neil O'Donovan (left on 31 July 2023), Ingrid Reumert, and Varun Sivaram (joined on 1 August 2023). The increase is due to number of members increasing from three in 2022 to seven at the end of 2023.\n- 3 The expensed remuneration for Mads Nipper includes an expense related to the cancellation of two LTI grants due to not meeting the shareholding requirement. Despite his increase in shareholding, the total value of his shares was not sufficient to satisfy the build-up of the shareholding requirement for continued participation in the share program. In accordance with IFRS 2, the 2023 and future expense related to the two grants from 2021 and 2022 have been accelerated, and DKK 4.5 million have been expensed and reported as share-based remuneration to Mads in 2023 despite him not receiving any remuneration from the two grants.\n- 4 Including DKK 1,373 thousand related to share-based payments as, in accordance with the programme terms, Daniel Lerup kept his rights to the 2021, 2022, and 2023 grants.\n- 5 Including DKK 3,147 thousand related to share-based payments as, in accordance with the programme terms, Martin Neubert kept his rights to the 2020, 2021, and 2022 grants. As Martin has entered into a new position in 2023 during the notice period, we have the right to offset his new salary.\n\n## Pension plans and number of employees\n\nPension plans are defined-contribution plans that do not commit \u00d8rsted beyond the amounts contributed.\n\nIn 2023, our average number of employees was 8,666 (2022: 7,428).\n\n## Remuneration of the Group Executive Team\n\nThe remuneration of the Group Executive Team is based on a fixed salary, including personal benefits, such as a company car, free telephone, etc., a variable salary, and share-based payment. The non-executive members of the Group Executive Team also receive a pension.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are paid a fixed remuneration only for their work in \u00d8rsted. In addition, \u00d8rsted reimburses any travel expenses.\n\nFor more details on the remuneration of the  Executive Board, please refer to the remuneration report orsted.com/remuneration2023.",

A build-up period of up to five years is allowed.\n\n## Executive share programme\n\nThe Group Executive Team and a number of other senior executives participate in the share programme (approx. 150). As a condition for the granting of performance share units (PSUs), the participant must own a number of shares in \u00d8rsted corresponding to a portion of the individual participant's annual fixed salary. The portion depends on the employee category, and it makes up 75 % of our CEO's fixed salary. See the table above for more information. The participants in the programme must invest in \u00d8rsted shares prior to the first granting. A build-up period for the shareholding requirements of up to five years is allowed. If the particip ants fulfil the shareholding requirement at the time of granting, they will be granted a number of PSUs each year,\n\nrepresenting a value of 15-20 % (15-40 % in the US) of the annual fixed salary on the date of granting.\n\nThe granted PSUs have a vesting period of approximately three years. Then, each PSU entitles the holder, without payment, to receive a number of shares corresponding to 0-200 % of the number of PSUs granted. The vesting is conditional upon continued employment. Assuming no share price development since the grant, the value would correspond to 0-30 % or 0-40 % (0-80 % in the US) of the fixed salary on the date of grant. The final number of shares for each participant will be determined on the basis of the total shareholder return delivered by \u00d8rsted, benchmarked against ten comparable European energy companies.\n\nThe highest rate (200 %) will be triggered if \u00d8rsted's results, measured as the total return to shareholders, outperform those of the comparable companies. For each lower ranking, the number of shares granted will fall by 20 percentage points. If, for example, \u00d8rsted ranks third, the participants will be entitled to 160 % of the target.\n\nIf \u00d8rsted ranks 11 in the comparison, no shares will be granted to the participants. The right to shares is conditional upon continued employment.\n\n## Retention share programme\n\nThe target group for the share-based retention agreements will typically be employees responsible for vital, long-term projects. The use of these share-based retention agreements will be limited to 25 concurrent agreements with an individual time frame of up to five years. Members of the Executive Board (CEO, CFO, and Chief HR Officer) cannot be granted such retention agreements.\n\nThe number of retention share units (RSUs) to be granted will be determined on the basis of the price of \u00d8rsted's shares at the time of the grant and will be limited to an amount corresponding to a maximum of six months' base pay for the employee in question. At vesting, each RSU will entitle the employee to one \u00d8rsted share free of charge. However, the total value of the shares to be received at vesting will be capped at a maximum of twelve months' base pay for the employee in question.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nThe share programme is classified as an equitybased programme as the programme is settled in shares. The market value of the PSUs and the estimated number of PSUs granted are measured at the time of granting and recognised:\n\n- \u00b7 in the income statement under employee costs over the vesting period\n- \u00b7 as an offset in the balance sheet under equity over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation of the PSUs and the estimate of the number of PSUs expected to be granted are carried out as a probability simulation based on \u00d8rsted's expected total shareholder return relative to ten comparable European energy companies. The expectations are factored into the market value and are not adjusted subsequently. The participants are compensated for any dividend payments by receiving additional PSUs.",

The obligations are measured at nominal value.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe mainly lease office buildings, service and installation vessels, seabeds related to offshore wind farms, and plots of land related to onshore wind farms, solar farms, and battery storage facilities.\n\nSeabed leases include variable lease payments, which depend on the number of megawatt hours generated. However, we have typically agreed on minimum lease payments for the seabeds, and these minimum payments are included in the lease liabilities.\n\nExpenses for the year relating to variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities were DKK 717 million in 2023 (2022: DKK 609 million). Interests on lease debt expensed in profit (loss) were DKK 308 million in 2023 (2022: DKK 256 million).\n\nTotal cash outflow for leases were DKK 1,737 million in 2023 (2022: DKK 1,447 million).\n\nWe have not entered into lease liabilities which have not been commenced per 31 December 2023 and consequently not included in the balance sheet.\n\nFor a maturity analysis of lease liabilities, we refer to note 5.5 'Maturity analysis of financial liabilities'.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nOur contractual obligations for property, plant, and equipment at 31 December 2023 mainly related to wind turbines, foundations, and cables, etc., for the construction of offshore wind farms (primarily  Borkum Riffgrund 3, Gode Wind 3, Greater Changhua 2b and 4, Hornsea 3, Revolution Wind, South Fork, and Sunrise Wind).\n\nThe obligations in Onshore mainly related to  purchases of wind turbines and solar PV modules.\n\n## Useful lives\n\n| Battery storage                                          | 15 years    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Buildings                                                | 20-50 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings, tools, and equipment              | 3-10 years  |\n| Gas transportation systems (marine pipelines)            | 20-40 years |\n| Offshore wind farms                                      | 20-30 years |\n| Onshore wind farms                                       | 24-30 years |\n| Production assets, power (thermal), and district heating | 20-25 years |\n| Solar farms                                              | 35 years    |\n| Goodwill                                                 | Indefinite  |",

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment\n\nNote 3.1 - continued\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nRights are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated future useful lives, which are 5-20 years.\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units, which are the operating segments at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not tax deductable.\n\nAnnual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\n## Property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment which is not a lease is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of property, plant, and equipment is depreciated by using the straight-line method, the diminishing-balance method, or the reducingfraction method. The diminishing-balance method and the reducing-fraction method result in decreasing depreciation over the useful life. These methods are used for some of our offshore wind farms.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant, and equipment are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n\nCosts comprise purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date the asset is available for use. The costs of self-constructed assets comprise direct and indirect costs of materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. Borrowing costs relating to both specific and general borrowing directly attributable to assets under construction with a lengthy construction period are recognised in costs during the construction period. Costs are increased by the present value of the estimated obligations for demolition and decommissioning of assets to the extent that the obligations are recognised as provisions.\n\nSubsequent costs, for example in connection with replacement of parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset in question when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group from the expenses incurred. Any residual value of the replaced parts is recognised in the income statement as loss on disposal of  non- current assets. Other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as incurred.\n\n## Leases\n\nOur lease assets are classified alongside our owned assets of similar type under property, plant, and equipment. Initially, we measure a lease asset at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. We depreciate our lease assets over the lease term. The depreciation method used is the straight-line method for all our lease assets, except for seabed leases where the depreciation method is aligned with the depreciation method for the related\n\noffshore wind farm. Therefore, seabed lease assets are depreciated using either the straight-line method or the reducing-fraction method.\n\nOur lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the in-substance fixed lease payments for the use of a lease asset. If, at inception of the lease, we are reasonably certain about exercising an option to extend a lease, we will include the lease payments in the option period when calculating the lease liability. We measure the lease asset to the value of the lease liability at initial  recognition.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and nonlease components. We allocate the consideration in a contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone prices. We account for non-lease components in accordance with the accounting policy applicable for such items. Non-lease components comprise building services and operating costs of leased vessels, etc.\n\nVariable lease expenses are recognised in other external expenses in the period when the condition triggering those payments occurs. Interests of lease liabilities are recognised in financial expenses.\n\nEach lease payment is separated into repayment of the lease liability and payment of interests of the lease liability. Debt repayments are classified as cash flows from financing activities, and payment of interests are classified as cash flows from operating activities.",

Following this, we recognised impairment losses of DKK 28.4 billion in our interim financial report for the first nine months of 2023.\n\nWe have updated our impairment calculations as of 31 December 2023. Management has taken the above-mentioned impacts and other related risks and inherent uncertainties into consideration when estimating the future cash flows for the value-in-use calculations of our cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nBased on this, our impairment tests prepared in Q4 2023 have resulted in a reversal of impairment losses of DKK 1.6 billion, mainly driven by a decrease in the US long-dated interest rate from 30 September to 31 December 2023, which lowered our WACCs. Thus, we have recognised total impairment losses of DKK 26.8 billion in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, we recognised impairment losses of DKK 2.5 billion related to Sunrise Wind.\n\n## Ceasing development of Ocean Wind 1\n\nOn 31 October, we decided to cease the development of Ocean Wind 1 in the form it was awarded by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ocean Wind 1 had been faced with a variety of challenges, such as higher costs of capital (US risk-free rate increasing by approx. 300 bps from the award in 2019), cost inflation, supply chain challenges, and slow permitting.\n\nAs explained in our interim financial report for the first nine months of 2023, the decision to cease the development was taken after additional supplier delays further impacted the project schedule, which led to an additional significant delay to the project. In addition, we had updated our view on certain assumptions, including tax credit monetisation and the timing and likelihood of final construction permits.

In late August, we concluded that risks remained in the suppliers' ability to deliver on their commitments and contracted schedules, in part due to worldwide vessel scarcity. These risks could create knock-on effects, requiring future remobilisations to finish installation as well as potentially delayed revenues, extra costs, and other business case implications.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, these risks are still present, and assumptions and estimates in relation to these risks\n\nhave been reassessed and taken into consideration in our impairment calculations. Further, our impairment tests are based on a probability- weighted assessment of the likelihood of these and other supply chain impacts. While we are taking mitigating actions to the extent possible, we continue to see risks, especially regarding vessel availability.\n\nThe effect from changes in supplier-related assumptions, including derived impacts on revenue and OPEX, has led to an impairment loss of DKK 17.8 billion and relates to our US offshore projects. The main part relates to Ocean Wind 1. Furthermore, we now assume a new installation approach with a longer timeline for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nInvestment tax credit guidance The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reaffirmed the existing 30 % ITC for all US offshore projects. The IRA also made two additional 10 % ITC bonus credits available to projects meeting 'domestic content' and 'energy community' criteria. Projects can qualify for one or both ITC bonus credits.\n\nThe US treasury has provided preliminary guidance on how 'energy community' and 'domestic content' requirements will be defined and implemented by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and which exemptions to the requirements may be allowed.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty and sensitivity analyses\n\nDue to the impairments recognised, estimation uncertainty exists on the assets impaired. The assumptions with major uncertainties include investment tax credits, interest rates, OREC levels, and the supply chain.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses presented in the table show the related impact on impairment losses when a change in a given assumption increases or decreases the 'value-in-use' for our CGUs. The analyses are performed with all other assumptions unchanged.\n\nWe have included sensitivity analyses of impairment effects if WACC levels or assumptions related to ITC bonus credits change. The high probabilities for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind qualifying for the additional 10 % ITC bonus credits are based on our assessment that the onshore substations are located on brownfield sites as defined by the current 'energy community' guidance.\n\nIf WACC had increased by 50 basis points in the impairment test of e.g. Revolution Wind as of 31 December 2023, the impairment loss would have been DKK 0.6 billion higher.\n\nIf we had not included the probability-weighted additional 10 % ITC bonus credits in the impairment test of e.g. Revolution Wind as of 31 December 2023, the impairment loss would have been DKK 1.0 billion higher.\n\n## Impairment breakdown on balance sheet\n\nThe total impairment losses are recognised with DKK 19,282 million under 'Property, plant, and equipment' and DKK 7,493 million under 'Provisions' as 'Onerous contracts'.",

        "page_content": "## Impairments\n\nNote 3.2 - continued\n\nIn our impairment testing, we have assumed a 95 % probability of achieving an additional 10 % ITC bonus credit for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind due to the brownfield status of both sites under the current 'energy community' guidance. These assumptions are unchanged compared to our expectations as of 30 September 2023 and 31 December 2022. However, for Ocean Wind 1, we reduced the probability of achieving an additional 10 % ITC bonus credit from 95 % at the end of 2022 to 15 % as of 30 September 2023. As at 31 December 2023, Ocean Wind 1 is terminated, and the probability of achieving ITC is no longer relevant.\n\nFor the impairment testing in September, we changed our tax credit monetisation assumptions as a result of the deterioration of the business cases and our understanding of market conditions for third-party tax monetisation of US offshore wind ITCs. These changes, which were kept in December, had a negative impact on the recoverable amounts.\n\nThe effect from the change in assumptions related to achieving and monetising ITCs for offshore projects is included in the impairment loss with DKK 4.7 billion.\n\n## Sunrise Wind OREC price\n\nIn 2019, Sunrise Wind signed a 25-year OREC purchaseand-sale agreement with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), with an OREC strike price at USD 110 per MWh.\n\nIn June 2023, we submitted a petition to the state of New York to increase the OREC price by 27 % to USD 140 per MWh due to significant cost and inflation increases since the agreement was entered into. This petition was denied by the state on 12 October 2023.\n\nFollowing the rejected petition and the outcome of the New York 3 tender in October, the state of New York commenced a new solicitation for capacity with bid deadline on 25 January 2024. Together with our partner, we decided to rebid our Sunrise Wind project at a bid price level reflecting the current component and financing costs.\n\nAs a consequence of participating in the solicitation, the OREC awarded in 2019 is no longer valid, meaning that we will have a merchant project if we do not get an award. In our impairment test for Q4 2023, we have assumed a 75 % probability of achieving an award, whereas we assumed a 50 % probability of an award in the impairment test prepared in Q3 2023.\n\nThe higher applied probability weighting is based on the evaluation criteria of the request for proposal (RFP), the size of the solicitation, a competitor analysis, and the price level we submitted.\n\nIf we get an award, the impairment loss will be reduced by approx. DKK 1.8 billion. If we do not get an award, the impairment loss will be approx. DKK 5.5 billion higher. These sensitivity analyses are performed with\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment losses, 'Intangible assets', and 'Property, plant, and equipment' are grouped at the level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units (CGUs)).\n\nCGUs are assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable. If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount is made.\n\nThe value of a CGU is impaired if the net book value exceeds the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the estimated value-in-use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Value-in-use calculations are based on management's expectations to future cash flows from financial forecasts and business plans and include a number of assumptions and estimates. Fair value less costs of disposal is used for seabeds and is based on a multiple analysis and discounted cash flow models, if a business case is available.\n\nEstimating expected cash flows involves a number of assumptions and estimates. In the US, key estimates and assumptions for the forecast periods are CAPEX (including knock-on effects from supplier delays, etc.), inflation, terms of conditions in new power purchase agreements, possible renegotiations of existing ORECs (which do not have inflation indexation), eligibility for bonus ITCs, and tax equity arrangements or alternative ways of monetising the ITCs. All these key estimates and assumptions are determined specifically for each CGU.\n\nThe discount rate applied when calculating valuein-use takes general risks into account and is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after tax, whereas the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a nominal post-tax discount rate.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement and, except in the case of goodwill, reversed if there has been a change in the  estimates used to determine the CGU's recoverable amount. Reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income in the income statement net of depreciation if no impairment loss had been recognised for the CGU.",

The outcome of the solicitation is expected in March.\n\n## Increasing interest rates\n\nThe US long-dated interest rate has increased significantly during the last couple of years and took another increase of approx. 75 bps from 30 June to 30 September 2023, after which it decreased approx. 50 bps from 30 September to 31 December 2023.\n\nThe effect from the increase and subsequent decrease in the interest rate was asymmetrical, as we terminated the Ocean Wind 1 project on 31 October 2023. The net effect of the change in interest rate assumptions was an impairment of DKK 4.4 billion after reversing losses of DKK 1.9 billion compared to the recognised impairment loss in our interim financial report for the first nine months of 2023. These impairment losses relate to our US offshore and onshore projects.\n\n## Seabed value of Ocean Wind 1 and Skipjack Wind\n\nWhen estimating the recoverable amount of the seabeds related to Ocean Wind 1 and Skipjack Wind, we have used the approach 'fair value less costs of disposal' (FVLCD) to determine if the carrying amounts exceed the recoverable amounts.\n\nWe have used multiple analysis and discounted cash flow models where a business case is available to estimate the recoverable amount of the seabeds. These valuations are subject to significant uncertainties. There are limited transactions for seabeds in the\n\nmarket and limited auctions reflecting what a third party could obtain as a PPA (OREC) price in a re-bid or new tender under the current component and financing costs. Our assessments include comparisons with current merchant prices, such as the winning prices in the New York 3 round, multiples from the 2022 NY Bight Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) lease auction, and other relevant lease sales in the US, such as in North Carolina and California. The fair value measurements are categorised as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Potential consequences of further adverse development\n\nIn addition to the sensitivities described, further adverse developments may lead us to cease development of or reconfigure projects currently under development. Besides impairing the capitalised value of these projects, ceasing to develop projects could lead to compensation to suppliers or other stakeholders for cancelling contracts. Costs related to cancelling contracts will be recognised as 'Other operating expenses' in our income statement (part of EBITDA) when the obligation arises, and to the extent these exceed already recognised onerous contracts.\n\n## Impairment losses relating to intangible assets\n\nWe have not recognised any material impairment losses to goodwill or other intangible assets in 2023.\n\nGoodwill primarily relates to Onshore Europe.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Key assumptions in impairment tests\n\nValue-in-use calculations are based on management's expectations to future cash flows from financial budgets and forecasts and include a number of assumptions and estimates.\n\nThese assumptions include construction schedules, estimates of future market conditions, CAPEX, market prices of energy and commodities, inflation, discount rates, useful lives of the projects, tax incentives, including the ability to qualify for tax credits from the US Inflation Reduction Act, etc.\n\nThe market prices applied are based on available forward prices for a period of up to five years and our best estimate of long-term prices for the remainder of the period.\n\nAs goodwill relates to greenfield onshore wind and solar development in Europe, an assumption included in the value-in-use calculations for goodwill is the ability to develop new sites. This assumption is based on current and future build-out plans for renewable energy in Europe.\n\nWhile there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions, the assumptions reflect management's best estimate over the lives of the Group's CGUs.",

The acquisition of Ostwind constituted \u00d8rsted's entry into the sizeable and growing German and French onshore markets and substantially expanded \u00d8rsted's onshore footprint in Europe.\n\nDuring 2023, the opening balances for Ostwind have been finalised without any adjustments to the provisional opening balances.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nAcquisition of enterprises is recognised using the acquisition method. Under this method, assets and liabilities as well as contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprise are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition.\n\nThe fair values of production assets and assets under construction are normally determined using an income approach where they are valued at present value based on the expected cash flows they can generate, including any non-separable power purchase agreements, and on income, such as production tax credits.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is determined using our normal approach for such items, which is based on market prices or expectations for prices over the term of the derivatives.\n\nThe fair values of other assets and liabilities are valued using the approach we find most relevant for the individual item, which can be either a market approach, an income approach, or a cost approach.\n\nAn acquired enterprise is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which is the date when we obtain control.\n\nWhen an acquired enterprise has entered into a power purchase agreement classified as a derivative, the fair value of the agreement will be included in the opening balance. Postacquisition, this fair value is recognised as an adjustment to revenue over the duration of the contract, based on the fair value calculation at the time of the acquisition.",

The remaining 50 % of the Hornsea 2 transmission asset was divested in 2023.\n\n'Gas' primarily relates to our gas trade activities.\n\n'Green certificates' are primarily renewable obligation certificates (ROCs), which are issued to renewable energy power generators in the UK.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nOffshore transmission assets are recognised as inventory until divestment and measured at cost. The costs comprise costs of materials used in construction, site labour costs, costs of renting equipment as well as indirect production costs, such as employee costs.\n\nGas storage in non-Danish facilities are managed on a fair value basis, and therefore, the gas in these storage facilities is recognised at fair value less costs to sell. Changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in cost of sales in the period of the change.\n\nGas in Danish storage facilities are recognised at cost, determined as a weighted average of the previous month's purchase price, including transport costs.\n\nPurchased carbon emission allowances are measured at market value.\n\nGreen certificates, which we earn by generating power using renewable energy sources, are recognised in inventories in step with our generation. We measure green certificates (earned and bought) at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle.\n\nOther inventories are measured at cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis (e.g. for coal and biomass) or by net realisable value, if net realisable value is lower.\n\nInventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost price. For offshore transmission assets, it is the expected final transfer value announced by Ofgem.\n\nThe net realisable value is the sum (discounted) which the inventories are expected to generate through a normal sale.",

Except for this, we have not made any write-downs of receivables in 2023 or 2022.\n\nReversal of write-downs was DKK 29 million.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nWe keep our receivables until maturity, and therefore, they are measured at amortised cost.\n\nWrite-downs are carried out from initial recognition of our receivables. The write-down is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the net present value of expected future cash flows from the receivable. The discount rate used is the effective interest rate for the individual receivable or the   individual  portfolio.\n\nWe apply the simplified approach to the write-down of trade receivables, which permits calculating the write-down as the full loss during the entire term of the receivable.\n\n## Supply chain finance\n\nNote 3.7\n\n|                                                                        | 2023                         | 2023                                         | 2022                         | 2022                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Supply chain finance - liabilities paid by supplier finance banks DKKm | Recognised in  balance sheet | Of which is paid  by supplier  finance banks | Recognised in  balance sheet | Of which is paid  by supplier  finance banks |\n| Trade payables                                                         | 14,915                       | 1,571                                        | 20,641                       | 482                                          |\n\nWe have entered into supply chain finance agreements with a limited number of suppliers.

During 2023, we commissioned the onshore wind farm Sunflower, and we received a tax equity contribution from our partner for this project. We also received a tax equity contribution related to our offshore wind farm South Fork, which is still under construction.\n\n## Description of tax equity partnerships\n\nTax equity partnerships are characterised by a tax equity partner, who contributes an upfront payment as part of the initial project investment and generally does not have an operational role in the project. The partner receives a contractually agreed return on\n\nthe contribution. In order to 'repay' the initial contribution and the return, a disproportionate share of the production tax credits (PTCs) or the investment tax credits (ITCs) and other tax attributes (accelerated tax depreciation and other taxable results) are allocated to the partner during the first part of the project's lifetime. The partner also receives some cash payment-based percentages specified in the partnership agreements. Once the partner receives the agreed return, the agreement flips, and the partner is typically entitled to a minor part of the cash distributions from the project, unless we repurchase this right from them, which is highly likely.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nDue to the operational and financial nature of the tax equity partnerships, we normally have the power to affect relevant activites and make decisions for the projects as the managing partner in the agreements. Therefore, we normally fully consolidate companies that have tax equity partners.\n\nThe tax equity contribution generally has the characteristics of a liability as the initial contribution is repaid, including an agreed return, and the partner does not share in the risks of the project in the same way as a shareholder.\n\nAs such, the contribution is accounted for as a liability and measured at amortised cost. The liability is based on the expected method of repayment and is divided into:\n\n- \u00b7 a net working capital element to be repaid through PTCs/ITCs and other tax attributes\n- \u00b7 an interest-bearing debt element expected to be repaid through cash distributions.\n\nThe partner's agreed return is expensed as a financial expense and is recognised as an increase of the tax equity liability. PTCs, ITCs and other tax attributes transferred to the tax equity partner are recognised as other operating income. PTCs are recognised in the periods earned, while ITCs and other tax attributes are recognised on a straightline basis over the estimated contractual length of the partnership.\n\nIn addition to the above, we recognise a liability for the expected purchase price for the partner's post-flip rights to cash distributions. This liability is recognised at fair value, and adjustments are expensed as a financial item. This recognition reflects the intention and high likelihood that we will purchase the partner's post-flip rights, and they are part of the financial costs of the arrangement.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Recognition of tax equity partnerships\n\nOn formation of a tax equity partnership, we assess the appropriate recognition of the partner's contribution as well as the method of recognition for the elements used to repay the partner, such as PTCs, ITCs, and tax attributes.\n\nWhen assessing the recognition of the partner's contribution, we look at:\n\n- \u00b7 the expected flows of PTCs/ITCs, tax attributes, and cash payments to the partner\n- \u00b7 the rights and obligations of both us and the tax equity partner.\n\nThe deferral of the income related to tax attributes and the recognition of the contribution as  working capital or interest-bearing debt are affected by our expectation to the size, method, and timing of repayments.\n\n## Government support in the US\n\nIn the US, PTCs, ITCs, and other tax attributes are used to incentivise investment in renewable energy assets - similar to subsidies in other countries.",

When we construct offshore wind farms in cooperation with partners, they are liable for their share of the decommissioning costs. Therefore, we have only included the decommissioning obligations associated with our ownership interest in the offshore wind farms.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions comprise primarily:\n\n- \u00b7 offshore partnership provisions, including warranty obligations\n- \u00b7 obligations in relation to the divestment of our oil and gas business in 2017\n- \u00b7 obligations in respect of our own carbon emissions\n- \u00b7 other contractual obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nNote 3.10 - continued\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nOnerous contracts primarily relate to ceasing the development of Ocean Wind 1 where we have a provision of DKK 15 billion at the end of 2023. The provision relates to cancellation fees on contracts and has been recognised in two steps.\n\nFirst, as an onerous contract provision as part of the impairment of Ocean Wind 1 in the interim financial report for the first nine months of 2023 (CAPEX provision), net of investments incurred on the project up until it was terminated on 1 November.\n\nSecondly, a further provision was recognised at yearend ('Other operating expenses' provision) to cover cancellation fees not covered by the provision on 30 September 2023.\n\nAs a result, a total of DKK 9.6 billion was recognised in 'Other operating expenses', with the remaining amount being recognised in 'Impairment losses on intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment'.\n\n'Used during the year' primarily relates to CAPEX spent on construction of Ocean Wind 1 until the termination of the project and other costs associated with terminating the project. 'Used during the year' also relates to CAPEX spent on the construction of Sunrise Wind.\n\nWhen measuring the provision for 'Onerous contracts' related to the cancellation fees, we have assessed the contracts related to the Ocean Wind 1 project. This assessment has included an evaluation of the contractual terms, including whether the contracts will be  terminated for cause or convenience, and the expected costs of fulfilling or cancelling the contracts.\n\nThe most significant contracts relate to the construction and installation of wind turbine generators, export cable systems, fabrication and construction of pipes and foundations, offshore and onshore substations, and other contractual agreements for transportation, mobilisation, and installation of components.\n\nThe assessment also includes an evaluation of the possibilities of reusing or selling certain project development assets and reselling the seabed lease to a third party. We expect to reuse the export cables for another offshore wind farm project, which is reflected in the provision.\n\nThe measurement of the total provision is impacted by significant estimates and judgements and depends on negotiations with subcontractors and  contractual partners. As of 31 December 2023, we have only agreed on settlement of a small portion of the contracts' value. While the recognised provision is management's best estimate, the outcome could deviate materially.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 We have a legal or constructive obligation as a result of an earlier event.\n- \u00b7 The settlement of the obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources.\n- \u00b7 The obligation can be measured reliably.\n\nDecommissioning obligations are measured at the present value of the future liability in respect of decommissioning as expected at the balance sheet date. The present value of the provision and changes in estimate are recognised as part of the cost of property, plant, and equipment and depreciated together with the associated asset. The addition of interest on provisions is recognised in the income statement under financial expenses.\n\nFor onerous contracts, a provision is made when the expected income to be derived from a contract is lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting our obligations under the contract.\n\nProvisions concerning carbon emissions are recognised when our actual emissions exceed our holding of carbon emission allowances.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Assumptions for provisions\n\nWe continually assess our provisions recognised to cover contractual obligations and claims raised against \u00d8rsted. Timing, probabilities, amounts, etc., which have a bearing on our provisions' estimates, are updated quarterly based on our expectations.\n\nEstimates of provisions are based on our expectations of, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 timing and scope of obligation\n- \u00b7 future cost level\n- \u00b7 legal  assessment.\n\nIf deemed material, non-current provisions are discounted using either the structural risk-free interest rate or the incremental borrowing rate. The structural risk-free interest rate is used for decommissioning liabilities and onerous contracts. It is calculated as the sum of real return (gross domestic product growth rate), inflation, and inflation premium for other risks. Separate structural risk-free interest rates are calculated for Europe, the UK, the US, and Taiwan.\n\nThe outcome of our contractual obligations and claims may depend on future events, which are uncertain by nature.\n\n## Key assumptions in estimating cancellation fees\n\nMeasuring the provision for 'Onerous contracts' related to cancellation fees for Ocean Wind 1 involves a number of assumptions and significant estimates and judgements. On contract level, we have assessed the contractual terms and obligations, including the expexted costs of fulfilling or cancelling the contracts. The assessment also includes an evaluation of the possibilities of reusing or selling certain project development assets and reselling of the seabed lease to a third party.\n\nTo a high degree, the estimation of the total provision depends on negotiations with subcontractors and contractual partners, which impact the settlement of the individual contracts. The measuring and estimation of the total provision for 'Onerous contracts' is based on management's expectations and best estimate of total costs.",

This also applies if there is no proof of negligence (strict liability). We have taken out insurance to cover any such claims.\n\n## Secondary liability\n\nAs part of the divestment of our oil and gas business in 2017, we assumed a secondary liability regarding the decommissioning of offshore installations.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are party to a number of court cases and legal disputes. In our assessment, none of these will significantly impact \u00d8rsted's financial position, neither individually nor collectively.\n\nWe have been party to actions relating to the Danish competition authorities' claim that the former Elsam A/S and Elsam Kraft A/S ('Elsam'), now part of \u00d8rsted, charged excessive prices in the Danish wholesale power market in the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2006.\n\nThere are no longer any outstanding cases with the competition authorities claiming Elsam infringed competition law, but in connection with the  former cases, some energy trading companies, some of their customers, and others have filed claims for damages, which are still pending. The biggest claim was filed in 2007 before the Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court, amounting to approx. DKK 4.4 billion with addition of litigation interest.

        "page_content": "## Approach to taxes\n\nNote 4.1\n\nAt \u00d8rsted, we want to provide user-friendly and transparent information about our global tax positions.\n\nWe are committed to paying the right amount of tax, at the right time, in the right place - in accordance with the tax laws of the countries where we operate. We seek to comply not only with the letter of the law but also with the underlying tax policy intent.\n\nWe believe that taxes are a core part of our corporate social responsibility.\n\nWe are committed to conducting our business in a way that contributes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taxes are a key contribution to the SDGs, in particular target 16.6 on the development of effective, accountable, and transparent institutions.\n\nFor more details on our approach to taxes, we refer to our tax policy, which can be found here: orsted.com/tax-policy.\n\n## Transparency and sustainability\n\nWe continue to report with inspiration from the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) 207: Tax standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax. The purpose of our transparency initiatives is to create certainty around our tax positions for our stakeholders, such as investors and the local communities where we pay our taxes, and where we operate.\n\nIn line with our tax policy, we engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups, and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation, and administration. We believe that by providing relevant and constructive input, we can contribute to an informed discussion around taxes and tax  policy. The purpose of our engagement is to promote the development of tax regimes that support the green transformation.\n\nDuring 2023, we have submitted two responses to public consultations by the OECD on Pillar 2 as well as offered our perspectives in a panel debate arranged by OECD on simplification of the Pillar 2 rules. Further, we have provided our responses on several public consultations in the US pertaining to the implementation of and guidance to the Inflation Reduction Act. To promote responsible tax practices, we are engaging with CSR Europe on developing a European index for responsible tax practices. Further, we participated in several panel debates, including at the Danish people's meeting, 'Folkem\u00f8det', in Denmark, with a view to promoting responsible tax practices.\n\nIn connection with the national implementation of the European revenue cap, we have engaged in discussions with the governments in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, offering our industry insights on the workings of the power markets as well as  hedging profiles of large integrated energy companies.\n\nSimilarly, we have participated in discussions with the UK government in respect of the adoption and implementation of the UK Electricity Generator Levy, referred to as windfall taxes. Due to declining power prices, the windfall tax regimes have not impacted us significantly.\n\nBy engaging with civil society and gathering input on, for example, how we share information, we believe we can contribute to increasing the public's confidence in the corporate tax system.\n\nAs a testament to our progressive and transparent approach to tax we have, besides being Fair Tax Mark accreditated for the second year running, achieved an overall tax compliance risk management rating of 'low' by HM Revenue & Customs (the UK) in the Business Risk Review (BRR+).\n\n## Pillar 2\n\nIn December 2021, OECD released the Pillar 2 model rules to reform international corporate taxation. The key purpose of these rules is to ensure that large multinational groups (defined by having a global revenue exceeding EUR 750 million) are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15 %. The rules will have to be implemented in national legislation in all individual countries that decide to adopt them. Many  countries, including Denmark where the ultimate  parent company of the \u00d8rsted Group is headquartered, have already implemented the rules.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UN SDG (no. 16)\n\nWe are transparent about our approach to tax. We actively participate in the development of effective, accountable, and transparent legislation by our engagement with the OECD on Pillar 2.\n\nWe endorse the B Team Responsible Tax Principles. The B Team is a group of business leaders, working to redefine the culture of accountability in business, for companies, communities, and future generations by creating and cascading new norms of corporate leadership that can build a better world.\n\n## ISRS 4400\n\n## AUP on application of GRI 207: Tax\n\nWe have drawn inspiration from the GRI 207: Tax standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax. The leadership team has been provided with a statement (ISRS 4400 - Agreed Upon Procedures/AUP) from our auditors on our application of GRI 207: Tax.\n\nThe Fair Tax Mark accreditation scheme seeks to encourage and recognise businesses that pay the right amount of corporation tax at the right time and in the right place. We seek to pay tax responsibly and transparently and are proud to have qualified for the Fair Tax Mark in 2022 and again in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Approach to taxes\n\nNote 4.1 - continued\n\nBased on initial analysis of our 2023 figures and 2024 forecast, we expect to benefit from the temporary safe harbour rules in all of the jurisdictions where we operate.\n\n## Tax governance\n\nTaxes are overseen by the Board of Directors, and within the Board, the Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee is accountable for our tax policy. The responsibility for tax risk management lies with the CFO and is overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee. The day-to-day tax management is handled by a centralised global tax team.\n\nOur tax function is involved in the planning, implementation, and documentation of all significant business decisions and processes to ensure a coordinated assessment of all tax compliance and risks. The tax function also regularly monitors and updates tax risks and related controls.\n\nComplying with tax rules can be complex, as the interpretation of legislation and case law may not always be clear cut and may change over time, giving rise to tax risks. We have implemented a governance framework, which ensures appropriate processes and organisational structures to identify, assess, monitor, and manage tax risks at different levels of the Group. We manage our tax risks by preventing unnecessary disputes, which we strive to achieve through strong technical positions, thorough documentation and explanations of our positions, robust compliance procedures, and by engaging in up-front dialogues with tax authorities.\n\nWe define a tax risk as any consequence relating to the application of our tax policy, day-to-day operations, compliance, or external reporting that impacts the business in the form of cash liabilities, financial reporting misstatements, or reputational damage. We continuously update our tax control framework to ensure that we are aligned with business objectives and stakeholder expectations.\n\nWe have a standardised review process in place, and our controls are continuously reviewed, assessed, and, where applicable, substituted by automated processes. Tax decisions in relation to matters which are subject to approval by the Group Executive Team or the Board of Directors are approved by the Head of Tax.\n\nOur tax risk management work includes considering uncertain tax positions, e.g. when we have taken a position where there is an uncertainty created by a comparison of the wording of the law, the expressed policy intent or lack thereof, or fluctuating or divergent application by tax authorities or judicial systems in the countries where we operate.\n\nOccasionally, a multinational enterprise like \u00d8rsted faces potential double taxation. This occurs when two or more tax jurisdictions seek to tax the same business income. We believe that profit should only be taxed once, and where the value is created in line with the position of the OECD.\n\nIn response to the tax risks connected to cross- border activities, including the controversies described in this section, we have made tax-related provisions in accordance with IAS 12, IAS 37, and relevant interpretation, such as IFRIC 23. The provisions have been calculated based on differences in tax rates and statistical risks of suffering economic or legal double taxation.\n\n## Tax planning and use of tax incentives\n\nWe only use business structures that are driven by commercial considerations and aligned with our business activities. We do not use so-called secrecy jurisdictions or tax havens to avoid taxes. If we establish an entity in a low or nil-rate jurisdiction, it will be for substantive and commercial reasons. This is the case with our Isle of Man entity, which holds a licence to develop and build a local offshore wind farm providing renewable energy to the Isle of Man, and with our  Singapore entity, which provides  technical and administrative services to wind farm projects. To remain competitive, we make use of incentives and tax relief implemented by governments where we have commercial substance, and our business activities are the intended beneficiaries of such incentives and relief. The tax function uses risk and  opportunities analyses to provide strong business case  assessment and forecast tax data. We therefore include the expected outcome of such opportunities in our longterm planning and decisions, and we seek to get certainty on the available incentives and tax reliefs in our planning activities.",

We have also received an information request in relation to the offshore wind farm  Hornsea 2. In all its decisions, the Danish Tax Agency claims that \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S has not acted at arm's length terms when charging fees for technical development services provided to the project companies. The  Danish Tax Agency claims that the full value of expected, future cash flows related to the offshore wind farms should be taxed in Denmark.\n\nUp until 31 December 2023, the Danish Tax Agency has increased \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S's tax payments to Denmark with DKK 8.9 billion for the income years\n\n2015-2017. The amount, which is excluding any interest, is detailed per wind farm in the table below.\n\nThe table illustrates the tax payable to Denmark per wind farm, should the Danish Tax Agency's position prevail, and the expected corresponding adjustments. The Danish tax would be payable upfront, plus  interests since the original decisions, and the corresponding adjustments would crystalise over the remaining lifetime of the wind farms.\n\nAs described in our key accounting estimates on page 189, we have made provisions for uncertain tax positions according to IFRIC 23. In relation to these transfer pricing disputes, we have used a weighted average of several different scenarios, where the base case is that we will win the cases, but a number of scenarios include different adjustments resulting in increased tax payable to Denmark. The scenarios with additional tax payable to Denmark assumes corresponding adjustments.\n\n| Decisions made by the Danish Tax Agency DKKm                                                 | Walney  Extension   | Hornsea 1        | Race Bank   | Borssele 1 & 2   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| Potential additional Danish tax payment excluding any interest                               | 2,949               | 2,337            | 2,488       | 1,088            | 8,862   |\n| Tax value of potential corresponding adjustment                                              | 2,651               | 2,294            | 2,236       | 1,180            | 8,361   |\n| Likely timing of settlement of potential tax in Denmark,   if the Danish Tax Agency prevails | 1st half of 2025    | 1st half of 2025 | TBD  1      | TBD  1           |         |\n\n- 1 Timing of settlement is likely to follow the same process and timeline as for Walney Extension and Hornsea 1.\n\n## Hornsea 1 and Walney Extension tax audit timeline\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tax controversies timeline\n\nTax controversies related to the development services provided from Danish entities to our projects outside of Denmark take multiple years to settle. The dispute concerning Hornsea 1 and Walney Extension has currently been ongoing for more than eight years from initiation of an advanced pricing agreement, which failed when the Danish Tax Agency chose to terminate negotiations with the British tax authorites (HM Revenue & Customs) and instead intiated an audit. The next step is for the cases to be settled in arbitration, which we expect to happen in the latter half of 2024. Above, we have summarised the timeline for Hornsea 1 and Walney Extension. Also, we have included a status of the other projects where a transfer pricing audit has started.\n\n## Race Bank\n\nWe have appealed the administrative decision to the Danish Tax Tribunal. We continue to consider our further options, including an elaborated appeal to the Danish Tax Tribunal, a direct appeal to the court system, or a request for a MAP under the double tax agreement between Denmark and the UK.\n\n## Borssele 1 & 2\n\nWe have appealed the administrative decision to the Danish Tax Tribunal. We continue to consider our further options, including an elaborated appeal to the  Danish Tax Tribunal, a direct appeal to the court system, or a request for a MAP under the double tax agreement between Denmark, the Netherlands, and the EU  Arbitration Convention.\n\n## Hornsea 2\n\nThe Danish Tax Agency issued an information request in October 2023. Discussions are on-going. In Denmark, the deadline for issuing a draft administrative decision is on 1 May 2024.\n\n## Closed audits\n\nThe Danish Tax Agency has closed the audits of Burbo Bank Extension and Borkum Riffgrund 2 without adjustments.",

Tax on profit (loss) for the year is recognised in the income statement. Tax relating to other items is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nOur uncertain tax positions are measured by using either of the following two methods, depending on which method we expect to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty:\n\n- \u00b7 The most-likely-outcome method is applied in cases where there are only two possible outcomes.\n- \u00b7 The weighted-average method is used in cases where there are more than two possible outcomes.\n\nOur uncertain tax positions are recognised under 'Income tax' or 'Deferred tax', depending on how the realisation of the tax position will affect the financial statement.\n\nWe have adopted the narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12, 'Income taxes', which provide temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar 2 model rules.",

This differs from taxes paid because of payments or refunds regarding prior years and residual payments for the current year.\n\nBecause of the high level of investments and the subsequent deferrals of payable tax as a consequence of accelerated tax depreciation, our current tax is generally lower than the statutory corporate tax rates during construction and the initial years after first power from a wind farm.\n\n## Pillar 2\n\nWe are assessing our exposure to the Pillar 2 legislation. Our initial assessment indicates the average effective tax rate based on the accounting profit being minimum 15 % and within the safe harbour rules exemption.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates regarding recognition of\n\n## income taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in all the countries where we operate. Significant judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nWhile conducting business around the world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business. Judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. We apply the methods prescribed in IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments' when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and the provisions made are based on different scenarios of possible outcomes. We consider the provisions made to be adequate. The actual obligation may deviate and might lead to tax in excess of the uncertain tax provisions included. This depends on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nOngoing tax disputes, primarily related to transfer pricing cases, are included as part of 'Income tax' and 'Deferred tax'. Estimates in respect of transfer pricing cases depend, among others, on whether corresponding adjustments can be obtained in the relevant jurisdictions, and, in terms of disputes regarding project companies with partners, whether compensation can be obtained from these partners. Any expected compensation from partners is included as part of 'Other receivables'.",

The distribution of net investments is affected by the sale of assets constructed by \u00d8rsted in Denmark for operations outside Denmark where \u00d8rsted only has part ownership. Jurisdictions not yet material are excluded from the overview.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the acquisition of joint operations, including licence interests\n- \u00b7 other items where differences arise at the time of acquisition, affecting neither the profit (loss) for the year nor the taxable income. However, this does not include differences arising in connection with company acquisitions. Except for right-ofuse assets, lease liabilities, decommissioning, restoration, and similar liabilities where the corresponding amounts are recognised as part of the costs of the related assets.\n\nDifferences arising in connection with company acquisitions are recognised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured depending on how we plan to use the assets and settle the liabilities. We offset tax assets and liabilities when the tax assets can be offset against tax liabilities in the year in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be used. Intra-group gains and losses are eliminated when calculating deferred tax. In countries where taxes can be offset between companies due to joint taxation schemes, we have netted within a tax jurisdiction. Where no such possibility is feasible, the deferred tax is included in the gross amount on a company-by-company level.\n\nTax losses carried forward in jurisdictions where we have a history of losses are recognised based on other convincing evidence of future profits. The other convincing evidence is based on our long-term forecast model approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nAdjustments to unrecognised tax assets are recognised in profit (loss) or other comprehensive income depending on the underlying source of the adjustment.\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and rates applying when the deferred tax becomes current tax. Changes in deferred tax because of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit (loss) for the year.\n\nDeferred tax (net liabilities) related to tax equity structures are recognised as a tax expense in the income statement when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The liability recognised is the amount that we expect to take over once the contribution from the equity partner is repaid, and the tax equity structure flips.\n\n## US tax equity partnerships\n\nWe have entered into several tax equity partnership agreements in the US.\n\nThe expected value of the deferred tax liability related to property, plant, and equipment at the flip date in the tax equity partnership agreement is included in our accounts when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The deferred tax liability from existing tax equity partnerships will gradually be reduced based on accounting depreciation after the flip date.

Historically, we have not paid significant taxes in these countries besides the UK. This is changing as our offshore wind farms are being commissioned and generating positive taxable income, resulting currently in paid taxes in more countries.\n\n- \u2192  As our business matures, we start to incur corporate taxes in the countries where we operate. Taxes in Denmark of DKK 1 billion regarding the current year was paid on 1 February 2024.\n\nWe are also continuously investing in the US. We do, however, not expect to pay material corporate taxes in the US in the near future due to the commercial structures in the US and the significant amount of tax assets not recognised in connection with the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project. The funding in the US is carried out applying the US tax equity set-up, which effectively means that tax attributes are transferred to the tax equity partner as repayment and return on investment.

        "page_content": "## Our tax footprint\n\nNote 4.4 - continued\n\n## A wind farm life cycle\n\nWe operate in several countries (see our global footprint in the 'Management's review'). The design of the individual tax regime in each jurisdiction impacts the tax over the life cycle of our investments and thereby the timing of our tax payments. A wind farm life cycle begins with the development phase. This includes opportunity screening, if applicable, bid preparation, and obtaining land rights, grid connection, and permits. The latter activities are further matured if an investment decision is made, and the construction phase commences, which includes construction of the wind farm. During both phases, product, people, and property taxes are borne or collected (see our total tax contribution section).\n\nWhen the wind farm is commissioned and put into operation, income and positive cash flows are generated. In many cases, the effect of tax incentives results in a deferral of taxable income compared to profit before tax for accounting purposes. Conversely, once the deferral ends, the taxable income related to the wind farm will exceed the accounting profit.\n\nFor this reason, the applicable corporate tax rate and the cash tax paid will always differ, but accumulated over the lifetime of the wind farm, they will be very similar.Also, in some of the jurisdictions where we operate, there are mandatory or voluntary tax groupings. This means that we will only pay tax on the consolidated result of all our activities in that country. As a result, continued significant investments in such a country may further defer the time when we pay taxes in that country.\n\n0\n\n## Wind farm life cycle example\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Project phases\n\n| Development  ~2-6 years                    | Construction ~2-4 years                                         | Operation ~25-30 years                  |                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Consents and permits   Site investigations | Capital investment   Asset construction   Staff and contractors | Revenue   Operating expenses  Profit    | Late-life development  Decommissioning |\n| Indirect taxes                             | Indirect taxes                                                  | Indirect taxes                          | Indirect taxes                         |\n| Employment taxes                           | Employment taxes Corporate income taxes                         | Employment taxes Corporate income taxes | Employment taxes                       |\n\nDevelopment activities result in negative cash flows in the beginning of the project life cycle. During construction, the capital employed accelerates materially. Positive income begins when the project enters into operation.\n\nSome corporate income taxes may be paid during development if internal development services are provided between tax jurisdictions.\n\nAlso, corporate income taxes may be paid during late-life development subject to deductibility of decommissioning costs and joint  taxation legislation.",

Our country-by-country reporting content widely follows the GRI 207: Tax standard. To ensure internal coherence throughout the annual report, corporate income tax is calculated based on IFRS accounting standards instead of GRI methodology.

This information can be compared with our total tax contribution. Our tax contributions reflect that some of our development and construction activities have been based in Denmark, and that our operations in the coming years are beginning to ramp up in markets that have been developed. Also, our presence and the corresponding tax position is affected by hedging, which is primarily handled centrally in Denmark.\n\nWithholding taxes are reported under the country where the payment is made.\n\nThe windfall taxes that came into effect in December 2022 have resulted in additional tax payments of DKK 3.3 million.\n\n## Current tax explanation on country level\n\nThe table shows our profit (loss) before tax in tax jurisdictions and the journey to current tax. Current tax for Denmark is impacted by effects from hedges. Also, the table shows the effect from the impairment of our Ocean Wind 1 project in the US. As we do not fulfil the  recognition requirements in IAS 12, the deferred tax asset associated with the impairment is not recognised. If our tax postion changes in the US, we may recognise the tax asset in future years.\n\nSee more in the section 'Accounting policies' in note 4.3 'Deferred tax'.\n\n1 Including employee costs transferred to assets.",

Therefore, we have taken and will continue to take measures to ensure a robust balance sheet supporting long-term growth and capital structure resilience towards 2030.\n\nIn February 2023, we issued three green bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 2,000 million (DKK 14,885 million).\n\nIn June 2023, we issued a EUR 100 million (DKK 745 million) blue bond. The net proceeds from the issuance will be allocated to investments in offshore biodiversity.\n\n## Equity and interest-bearing net debt\n\nDKKbn\n\n- Interest-bearing asset\n- Interest-bearing debt\n- Equity attributable to shareholders in \u00d8rsted A/S\n- Non-controlling  interests\n- Hybrid capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital structure\n\nTo ensure we have the financial strength to operate in the international energy and  capital markets and secure financing on attractive terms, we target a solid investment grade rating with all three major rating agencies. This includes an FFO/adjusted interest-bearing net debt credit metric above 30 %.\n\n## Financing policy\n\nThe aim of our financing policy is to minimise liquidity and refinancing risks while minimising financing costs and matching the currency composition of our debt with our revenue.\n\nWe obtain funding in different markets and with different maturities. Our debt is  primarily consolidated in the parent company where cash resources are made available to the Group companies via an internal bank.\n\n## Cash management and liquidity reserve\n\nA group-wide cash management set-up ensures optimal allocation of cash in relation to our dayto-day operations and investment programme. We target a liquidity reserve that ensures adequate coverage of our use of liquidity on a rolling 12 month forward-looking basis to limit the company's sensitivity to unforeseen developments, including unrest in the financial markets.\n\n## 28.6 %\n\nFunds from operations (FFO) relative to adjusted interest-bearing net debt amounted to 28.6 % at 31 December 2023 against 42.7 % at 31 December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 47. 4 b n\n\nOur interest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 47,379 million at 31 December 2023 against DKK 30,571 million at 31 December 2022.\n\n## 90.7 bn\n\nOur liquidity reserve totalled DKK 90,665 million at 31 December 2023 against DKK 97,784 million at 31 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Interest-bearing net debt and FFO\n\nNote 5.1 - continued\n\n## Interest-bearing net debt\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 47,379 million at the end of 2023, an increase of DKK 16,808  million relative to 2022. The increase in interest- bearing net debt consists of an increase in interest-bearing debt of DKK 14,874 million and a decrease in interest- bearing assets of DKK 1,934 million.\n\nIn February, we issued three new green senior bonds in the amount of EUR 2,000 million (DKK 14,885 million):\n\n\u00b7\n\nEUR 700 million (DKK 5,210 million),\n\n3.625 %  interest, maturing in March 2026\n\n- \u00b7 EUR 600 million (DKK 4,465 million), 3.750 %  interest, maturing in March 2030\n- \u00b7 EUR 700 million (DKK 5,210 million), 4.125 %  interest, maturing in March 2035.\n\nIn June, we also issued a EUR 100 million (DKK 745 million) blue senior bond with maturity in June 2028 and a fixed interest rate of 3.625 %. The net proceeds from the issuance will be allocated to investments in offshore biodiversity.\n\n## Rating\n\nWe have a corporate credit rating of BBB+/Baa1/BBB+ from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch.\n\nFollowing our announcement regarding impairment of our US portfolio on 29 August 2023, Moody's changed their outlook from stable to negative in\n\nSeptember 2023, and Standard & Poor's and Fitch followed in November 2023.\n\nIf our ratings should be downgraded by one notch to BBB/Baa2/BBB following clarification by the rating agencies, it will not impact \u00d8rsted's business activities.\n\n'FFO/adjusted interest-bearing net debt' was 28.6 % in 2023.\n\n## Market value of bond and bank debt\n\nThe market value of our bond and bank debt amounted to DKK 68,671 million and DKK 8,711 million, respectively, at 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 53,358 million and DKK 8,483 million, respectively). The market value of issued bonds has been determined as the market value at 31 December (level 1 - quoted prices).\n\nThe market value of bank loans has been determined as the present value of expected future instalments and interest payments using the Group's current interest rate on loans as the discount rate (level 2 -  observable inputs).\n\nDue to the level of interest rates being lower at the time of issuance, the market value of our bond and bank debt is below the carrying amount.\n\n## Changes in interest-bearing debt\n\n| DKKm                                                           | 2023    | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Interest-bearing debt at 1 January                             | 77,707  | 60,358   |\n| Cash transactions:                                             |         |          |\n| Proceeds from raising loans                                    | 17,584  | 37,090   |\n| Instalments on loans                                           | (1,580) | (21,482) |\n| Instalments on leases                                          | (712)   | (582)    |\n| Change in other interest-bearing debt and tax equity liability | (1,625) | 1,291    |\n| Non-cash transactions:                                         |         |          |\n| Raising lease debt, etc.                                       | 872     | 1,316    |\n| Bank loans acquired in a business combination                  | -       | 437      |\n| Foreign exchange adjustments, amortisation, etc.               | 335     | (721)    |\n| Interest-bearing debt at 31 December                           | 92,581  | 77,707   |\n\n## Loan arrangements and credit facilities\n\nAt 31 December 2023, we had bank loan obligations totalling DKK 5,030 million (2022: DKK 5,880 million) to the European Investment Bank and Nordic Investment Bank. The loans offered by these multilateral financial institutions cofund specific energy projects with maturities exceeding those normally available in the commercial banking market.\n\nFurthermore, we had non-cancellable credit facilities and undrawn loan agreements of DKK 51,159 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 57,179 million) with a number of Scandinavian, international, and Taiwanese banks. See note 5.4 'Liquidity reserve' for further details.\n\nIn connection with these loan arrangements and credit facilities, we may be met with demands for cancellation and repayment of any drawn amount in the event of shareholders other than a group consisting of the Danish state and Danish power distribution companies controlling more than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in \u00d8rsted A/S. Our  financing agreements are not subject to any other unusual terms or conditions.",

In subsequent periods, the liabilities are measured at amortised cost, so that the difference between the cost (proceeds) and the nominal value is recognised in profit (loss) for the year as interest expenses over the term of the loan, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as current, unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability to at least one year after the balance sheet date.",

The purpose of issuing hybrid capital is to strengthen our capital base and fund our investments. We have issued EUR hybrid bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 2,100 million and GBP 425 million, respectively, equivalent to DKK 19,310  million (2022: EUR 2,194 million and GBP 425 million, respectively,  equivalent to DKK 19,877 million).\n\nFor all our hybrid bonds, we have the right to defer coupon payments and ultimately decide not to pay them at maturity. Deferred coupon payments become payable, however, if we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders or pay coupon payments on other hybrid bonds.\n\nAs a consequence of the special terms regarding the hybrid bonds, these are classified as equity, and therefore coupon payments are recognised in equity.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nHybrid capital comprises issued bonds that qualify for treatment in accordance with the rules on compound financial instruments due to the special characteristics of the bonds. The notional amount, which constitutes a liability, is recognised at present value, and equity has been increased by the difference between the net proceeds received and the present value of the discounted liability. The carrying amount of the liability component amounted to nil on initial recognition as the only payment obligation is the repayment of the nominal value in 1,000 years.\n\nCoupon payments are accounted for as dividends, which are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon is discretionary, and therefore any deferred coupon lapses upon maturity of the hybrid  capital. Coupon payments are recognised in the statement of cash flows within financing activities.\n\nOn redemption of hybrid capital, the payment will be  distributed between liability and equity, applying the same ratio as when the hybrid capital was issued. This means that the difference between the payment on redemption and the net proceeds received on issue is recognised directly in equity, as the liability portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil during the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.",

Partly countered by an increase in available securities of DKK 5,088 million.\n\n## Collateral and margin postings\n\nWhen we trade in derivatives to execute our hedging strategy, we have two alternatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Trading where the market value is settled on an ongoing basis through receipt or placement of collateral.\n- \u00b7 Trading where we accept the credit risk that will occur if we gain on the transaction.\n\nWe are trading under both types of agreements to increase the number of counterparties with whom we are engaging to achieve the most optimal price.\n\nTo mitigate and limit the potential negative impact on our cash position from temporary fluctuations in market prices, we actively manage the volume of trades between trading with and without collateral arrangements.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 12 % (2022: 31 %) of our power and gas trades and 88 % (2022: 86 %) of our currency, inflation, and interest rate hedges had daily margin settlements.\n\nTo limit cash impact, we also provide non-cash collateral as parent company and bank guarantees, where possible. At the end of December 2023, we had covered EUR 0.5 billion in collateral for initial margins and variation margins on energy hedges through a parent company guarantee.\n\nOur collateral and margin payments related to trading with derivatives and collateral related to insurance liabilities and escrow accounts have decreased from DKK 17.3 billion at 31 December 2022 to DKK 7.9 billion at 31 December 2023. The decrease was  primarily driven by the large decrease in power and gas prices. During the year, collateral payments related to variation and initial margins decreased by DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 7.1 billion, respectively, and amounted to DKK 3.9 billion at 31 December 2023.\n\nInitial margin and variation margin relate to energy hedges, and the credit support annex (CSA) relates to currency, inflation, and interest rate hedges. Other collateral mainly relates to insurance liabilities and escrow accounts. Further securities can be placed as collateral in repo transactions as part of our cash management.\n\n## Liquidity reserve\n\nDKKbn\n\nCash Securities, available Undrawn, non-cancellable credit facilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collateral and margin postings\n\nDKKbn\n\n- Initial margin Variation margin Credit support annex Other  collateral\n\n<!-- image -->",

The overview includes interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate risk on the securities.\n\n## Cash, cash equivalents, and securities\n\nSecurities are a key element in our liquidity reserve, and therefore, investments are mainly made in liquid AAA-rated Danish mortgage bonds and, to a lesser extent, in other bonds. Most of the securities qualify for repo transactions with the Danish central bank, 'Danmarks Nationalbank'.\n\n'Securities not available for use' comprise securities pledged as collateral for:\n\n- \u00b7 insurance-related provisions: DKK 387 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 381 million)\n- \u00b7 trading in financial instruments: DKK 0 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 388 million).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, we had received cash collateral in the amount of DKK 286 million (2022: DKK 1,194 million) concerning the positive market value of derivatives.\n\n'Cash not available for use' comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 collateral for power purchase agreements and trading with financial instruments: DKK 421 million (2022: DKK 366 million)\n- \u00b7 collateral for insurance-related provisions: DKK 41 million (2022: DKK 38 million)\n- \u00b7 payables for the purchase of gas that has not yet been settled, placed on a restricted account: DKK 0 million (2022: DKK 2,029 million)\n- \u00b7 collateral for other transactions: DKK 19 million (2022: DKK 38 million).\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nSecurities comprise bonds that are monitored, measured, and reported at market value on an ongoing basis in conformity with the Group's investment policy. Changes in market value are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income and expenses. Purchase and sale of securities are recognised at the settlement date.\n\nFor listed securities, market value equals the market price, and for unlisted securities, market value is estimated based on generally accepted valuation methods and market data.\n\nDivested securities where repurchase agreements (repo transactions) have been made at the time of sale are recognised in the balance sheet at the settlement date as if the securities were still held. The amount received is recognised as a liability, and the difference between the selling price and the purchase price is recognised in profit (loss) for the year over the term as interest. The return on the securities is recognised in profit (loss) for the year.",

In 2023, 'Value adjustments of derivatives, net' is affected by a gain of DKK 2,399 million due to hedge ineffectiveness, mainly driven by less funding needed in the US after the termination of Ocean Wind 1.\n\n'Exchange rate adjustments, net' are mainly affected by inter-company balances between entities with different functional currencies and do not impact the statement of cash flows or interest-bearing net debt. Negative 'Exchange rate adjustments, net' in 2023 were mostly driven by the increase in GBP/DKK exchange rate. The GBP/ DKK rate decreased significantly in 2022, which led to positive exchange rate adjustments for that period.\n\nExchange rate adjustments of currency hedging are recognised in revenue and cost of sales with a loss of DKK 451 million (2022: a loss of DKK 349 million).\n\nBorrowing costs transferred to property, plant, and equipment under construction are calculated as the weighted average effective interest rate for general borrowing.

Through our risk management, we monitor and proactively manage the risks according to our risk appetite.\n\nIn this note, we describe the origination, governance, and management of market and credit risks. The management of liquidity risk can be found in note 5.\n\nOur financial market risks relate to energy prices, commodity prices related to CAPEX, currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation. Although not a financial risk, changes to our expected volumes produced or sold can increase or decrease the impact of these risks. The composition of the expected revenue from our offshore and onshore assets for 2024-2030 (shown to the right) illustrates the relative size of the risks.\n\nFurthermore, our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in the value of foreign currencies against Danish kroner.\n\n## Revenue composition of offshore and onshore assets 2024-2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the period 2024-2030, approximately 80 % of our expected  revenue from our wind and solar PV assets are fixed price inflation- indexed or fixed nominal.

For USD, we have hedged more than our current exposures in 2024-2028 due to a combination of hedges to be rolled further out in time and large changes to the exposures following the decision not to build Ocean Wind 1 and 2.\n\nWe do not deem EUR to constitute a risk as we expect  Denmark to maintain its fixed exchange-rate policy.\n\n## Energy exposure 2024-2026 2 DKKbn\n\n- Before hedging After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Energy exposure before hedging does not include revenue from inflation-indexed and fixed nominal prices as these do not contain any energy exposure.\n\nOur outright power exposure has decreased in 2023 due to the decrease in power prices.\n\n## ~ 45 % inflationindexed revenue\n\n~45 % of our revenue from offshore and onshore assets are fixed price-indexed to inflation, mainly from ROC and CfD subsidies in the UK and Poland.\n\n## ~ 35 % fixed nominal revenue\n\n- ~35 % of our revenue from offshore and onshore assets are fixed in nominal terms, mainly from fixed-price subsidies and CPPAs in Continental Europe, Taiwan, and the US as well as hedges swapping inflationindexed cash flows to fixed.\n\n## ~ 20 % merchant revenue\n\n~20 % of our revenue from offshore and onshore assets are exposed to merchant power prices, mainly from the period after expiry of subsidies or CPPAs.\n\n## DKK -9.9 billion\n\nThe value of our hedging instruments (mainly power) that will impact EBITDA in the future amounts to a loss of DKK 9.9 billion at 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 33.0 billion)",

        "page_content": "## Risk framework\n\nNote 6.1\n\nThe overall objective of our financial risk management is to:\n\n- \u00b7 increase the predictability of our short-term income and construction costs\n- \u00b7 protect our current and future investment capacity by stabilising key rating metrics like FFO/NIBD\n- \u00b7 protect the long-term real value of the shareholders' investment in \u00d8rsted.\n\nThe governance for managing market, credit, and liquidity risks are based on the three lines of defence model:\n\n- \u00b7 The first line of defence is responsible for all risks we take on through our business, hedging, and trading activities.\n- \u00b7 The second line of defence is Risk Management, which oversees the activities of the first line, challenges, monitors, and reports risk exposures, and mandate compliance.\n- \u00b7 The third line of defence is Internal Audit.\n\nThe mandates for first line are established  during the business planning processes and evaluated according to our risk appetite. An example is  deciding on the target hedge level for price exposures from intermittent power production as described in note 6.2 'Energy price risks'.\n\nIn our financial risk management processes, financial risks are quantified and assessed against our risk appetite - alongside decisions on suitable risk mitigation measures. Our biggest business risks and associated risk mitigation measures are presented in the 'Risk and risk management' section in the 'Management's  review'.\n\nThe Board of Directors overseas our risk management through the Audit & Risk Committee and approves associated frameworks, mandates, and limits per risk factor. See the 'Corporate governance' section in the  'Management's review' for governance around our committees.\n\nWe govern the accounting treatment and effectiveness of hedges by applying hedge accounting on energy, commodity, currency, interest rate, and inflation  hedging.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to our energy, commodity, currency, interest, and inflation hedges.\n\nAlmost all of the hedging instruments we use fully match the market risk of the exposure we hedge. The UK power exposure, for example, is hedged using UK power swaps or futures. Thus, the main source of ineffectiveness is related to the volume and timing of the actual production versus the settlement of the hedge. This difference in timing is referred to as volume risk and is described in more detail on the next page.\n\nTo the extent that a risk needs to be hedged, and if there is no fully effective instrument  available in the market, analyses are performed of the expected effectiveness of the hedging instrument before the hedging transaction is concluded. In this case, the ratio between the hedged risk and the hedging instrument may deviate from the one-toone principle and will be determined as the ratio which most effectively hedges the desired risk.\n\nWhen we conclude a hedging transaction, and each time we present financial statements thereafter, we assess the correlation between the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument. The effective change in market value of the hedging instrument is recognised as a hedge of future cash flows in other comprehensive income in the hedging reserve.\n\nIf the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to be realised, the in-full or partially accumulated value change is transferred to profit (loss) for the year. Ineffective hedges related to energy and commodity exposures are recognised in other operating expenses. Ineffectiveness related to other hedges are recognised in financial income or expenses.\n\nOn realisation of the hedged cash flow, the resulting gains or losses are transferred from equity and recognised in the same item as the hedged item. However, on hedging of proceeds from future loans, the resulting gain or loss is transferred from equity over the term of the loan.\n\nFor currency swaps, the basis spread is accounted for according to the cost of the hedging model.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Valuation of long-term power purchase agreements\n\nWhen we measure our power purchase agreements at fair value, we use estimates of nonobservable prices, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 production  forecasts\n- \u00b7 forecasted long-term power prices and exchange rates\n- \u00b7 forecasted inflation expectations.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge effectiveness is measured using forecasted production as well as estimates regarding energy prices, intermittency, interest, currency, and inflation. For periods where we are close to fully hedged, volume overhedging is possible if the forecasted production does not materialise, which will lead to recognition of ineffectiveness.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Valuation of long-term power purchase agreements\n\nWe measure our power purchase agreements at fair value, but they cannot always be measured against quoted prices in active markets due to the long duration of the contracts. We therefore use elements of judgement when measuring the fair value, and we aim to limit the use of  subjective estimates and base the fair values on external information, including external pricing and benchmark services.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nJudgements are used to consider whether forecasted transactions are highly probable exposures as hedged items in a hedge relationship, e.g. expected production from wind farms, and judgement is applied as to whether the hedge instruments applied in the hedge relationships identified are effective.",

        "page_content": "## Energy price risks\n\nNote 6.2\n\nOur main energy price risk stems from our intermittent power production from wind and solar PV assets. By nature, this is exposed to volume uncertainty, primarily driven by weather, price uncertainty, and the often negative correlation between the two. We are also exposed to other energy prices through our CHP plants and gas business.\n\n## Intermittent Offshore and Onshore power production\n\nAround 20 % of revenue from our power production in Offshore and Onshore in 2024-2026 is exposed to power prices.\n\nA large part of our income in Onshore comes from PTCs or ITCs related to power generation or investments in the US (see note 3.9 'Tax equity liabilities'). The tax credits are not exposed to a price risk. However, there is a price risk associated with the power produced, which we mainly reduce by entering into CPPAs. The current CPPAs cover approx. 73 % of the expected generation for the period 2024-2026. In general, the CPPAs are structured with a minimum price per MWh and a mechanism where we retain most of the upside from high power prices.\n\nTo mitigate our residual exposure to power price risks, we mainly use fixed-volume hedges. As both the value, volume produced, and the actual hourly production profile delivered by our assets differ from the fixed-volume hedges we use, we account for this in our hedging policy and strategies. The correlation between volumes produced and power prices is often negative, which is referred to as volume risk.\n\nA dynamic hedging approach is used to hedge up to 70 % of the residual power price exposure within a two-year horizon. This hedging level significantly reduces the risk of being overhedged while providing an adequate risk reduction.\n\nWe may hedge beyond the two-year horizon if the price level is commercially attractive.\n\n## Volume risk\n\nVolume risk Fixed-volume hedges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe grey area illustrates the volume risk where our actual production is either above or below the fixed volume in our hedges. When the additional value of the production (volume x market price) in area 1 does not match the missing value of the production in area 2, our actual production will not fully match our fixed-volume hedges. Due to the large share of renewable capacity, high production causes lower prices and vice versa.\n\n## Development in power prices, DKK\n\nDK 1 UK US (ERCOT) 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the historic development in monthly average spot power prices for the past three years and the forward rates for 2024 and 2025 as of 31 December 2023.

        "page_content": "## Energy price risks\n\nNote 6.2 - continued\n\n## Power generation at our CHP plants\n\n## Risk after hedging\n\nOur combined heat and power (CHP) plants consist of biomass- and fossil-fuelled plants in Denmark. The profitability of power generation is determined by the difference between the selling price of power and the purchase price of fuel and, for other fuels than biomass, carbon emission allowances. If the spreads are attractive, we provide condensing power generation in addition to CHP generation. The total net risk associated with power from CHP generation for the period 2024-2026 is DKK 5.9 billion after hedging,  covering both heat-bound and condensing base  generation. We are not exposed to price risks related to heat generation.\n\n## Gas sales\n\nThe price risk associated with sale of gas stems from differences in the sale and purchase prices. To the extent we purchase gas at a fixed price, we aim to use hedges to swap the purchase into a variable price. When we both have a variable purchase and sales price, our margin becomes fixed. The main risk after hedging is related to contracts where the purchase price is fixed, but where the volumes delivered to us depend on our suppliers' actual production.\n\nOur energy exposure after hedging for the years 20242026 can be summarised as shown in the table.\n\n| Risk after hedging        | Effect of price change   | Effect of price change   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| DKKbn                     | +10 %                    | -10 %                    |\n| Power: 14.2 sell position | +1.4                     | -1.4                     |\n| Spread (power): 5.9       | +0.6                     | -0.6                     |\n\nA 10 % increase in the power price will result in a gain of DKK 1.4 billion over the period 2024-2026, all else remaining unchanged.

The long duration of these cash flows exposes us towards changes in interest rates and  inflation, particularly for assets where the fixed nominal price received is constant regardless of interest rate, inflation, or merchant price level.\n\nWe have seen this first-hand during 2023 when increases from both interest rates and inflation affected our portfolio, particularly our fixed nominal assets in the US through rising interest rates, affecting the cost of capital and inflation through higher CAPEX and dilution of the value of our ORECs (PPAs).\n\nOur risk framework builds on the important  central assumption that shareholders prefer exposure to inflation-indexed cash flows over nominal cash flows, as this protects the real value of their investment. We apply an asset and liability management framework for handling interest rate and inflation risk. The objective is to manage the shareholders' real value by ensuring that fixed rate debt is matched with fixed nominal cash flows.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nWe actively incentivise assets with inflation-indexed revenue streams in business decisions to mitigate our cost-inflation risk. Our cost inflation mainly stems from OPEX, COGS, DEVEX, and CAPEX, which to a large extent increase with inflation. In addition, CAPEX is exposed to the price development in a number of commodities, most significantly steel. When the commodity adjustment mechanisms in our CAPEX contracts are based on financially tradeable indices, we aim to hedge the risk. Operational costs are assessed together with the inflation-indexed revenue to reduce the net risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development in inflation and interest rates\n\n%\n\n- USD 10-year interest rate EUR 10-year interest rate UK CPI annual rate\n- NTD 10-year interest rate GBP 10-year interest rate\n\n12\n\n10\n\n- The graph shows the historic development in interest and inflation rates for the past three years.\n\nThe graph covers our main markets where we are exposed to interest and inflation.\n\n## Inflation-indexed revenue in 2024-2030 is partly offset by inflation-indexed operational costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Operational costs are comprised of OPEX, COGS, and DEVEX after deduction of income from PTCs.",

        "page_content": "## Inflation and interest rate risks\n\nNote 6.3 - continued\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nWe actively match our debt with our assets per currency and modified duration. Modified duration of both assets and debt is the change in value in response to a 1 percentage point change in interest rates. As a rule of thumb, modified duration is matched within \u00b12 percentage points. For example, the fixed nominal cash flows from our Taiwanese projects with an average of 8.4 % in modified duration are matched with fixed-rate NTD debt with roughly 9.0 % modified duration.\n\nFor assets in operation and under construction, 95 % of the lifetime present value of fixed nominal cash flow, excluding CAPEX, is matched with corresponding fixed-rate senior and hybrid debt. Part of this matching has been done by entering into inflation swaps on our inflation-indexed CfD and ROC revenue in the UK to match our fixed-rate debt. As our portfolio of awarded assets mature, we can execute interest rate swaps to lock in the interest rates before funding is secured.\n\nA total of 25 % of the lifetime present value of fixed nominal cash flows, excluding CAPEX, on our awarded pre-construction offshore assets are matched with interest rate swaps.\n\nFinally, when we farm down part of an offshore asset, we normally hedge part of the interest, inflation, and currency risks related to the divestment proceeds.\n\n## Fixed-rate debt used to protect fixed nominal cash flows against interest rate increases\n\nFixed-rate debt and hybrids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor assets in operation and under construction, approximately 95 % of the fixed nominal cash flows are matched with a fixed interest rate on our debt and hybrid portfolio.\n\n- 1 Lifetime present value of fixed nominal cash flows, excluding CAPEX.

Furthermore, we hedge the interest and inflation risk related to divestments. All the inflation risks that we hedge are separately identifiable in the underlying contract.\n\nWe hedge the interest on expected USD (since 2020) and NTD (since 2023) debt issuance (USD and NTD interest risk). The size of the expected USD issuance has been reduced and postponed to 2025 or 2026 due to less funding needed after the termination of Ocean Wind 1. Due to a reduction in the expected funding, we have recognised ineffectiveness of DKK 2,344 million (gain) (2022: ineffectiveness gain of DKK 529 million) related to the US interest rate hedges in financial income and DKK 6 million (expense) related to the Taiwanese interest rate hedges in financial expenses. Further, we had an early redemption of an EIB loan, resulting in recognised ineffetiveness of DKK 41 million (2022: DKK 0 million) in financial expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Currency risks\n\nNote 6.4\n\nOur cash flows consist of multiple different currencies, which expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our main currency exposures are GBP, USD, and NTD. While our exposure to EUR is also significant, we do not deem EUR to constitute a risk as we expect Denmark to maintain its fixed exchange-rate policy.\n\nFor GBP, our significant earnings from assets in operation and expected farm-downs are larger than our planned CAPEX, resulting in a net-positive GBP exposure, both short- and long-term. The net exposure was lowered in 2023 by the inclusion of more planned GBP CAPEX following FID for Hornsea 3. A 10 % increase in the GBP/DKK exchange rate will result in a gain of DKK 1.2 billion over the period 2024-2028, all else remaining unchanged.\n\nFor USD, our portfolio of offshore and onshore development and operating assets translate to a short- to medium-term negative USD exposure. However, on a longer time horizon, revenue from assets result in a net positive USD exposure.\n\nOur general approach to managing currency risks is to use structural risk management tools, such as local currency sourcing contracts, netting income and expenses in the same currency, issuing local currency debt to naturally balance our portfolio, and prioritising local currency costs to match revenue in our asset projects to minimise the need for hedging.\n\nThe currency denomination of debt issuance is aimed at optimising the currency composition of net debt with that of forecasted FFO to ensure stability in FFO/ NIBD against adverse movements in exchange rates. Debt can be particularly effective in new markets to mitigate the time-spread risk since the proceeds from the debt issuance can be used to fund and hedge construction costs, while the debt repayment profile can be sculpted to match future revenue.\n\nThe residual currency risk after netting of exposures and debt are managed via financial derivatives according to our desired risk appetite. Our overall hedge horizon is five years, covering only highly certain cash flows to avoid hedge ineffectiveness. For energy price risks in foreign currencies, we do not hedge the exchange rate risk until the energy exposure has been hedged. For cash flows that relate to subsidised GBP income from our UK offshore wind farms less operating expenses, we hedge on a declining level over a five-year rolling horizon. The target is to hedge 100 % in year 1, declining by 20 percentage points each year to 20 % in year 5.\n\nOur currency exposure from production, sales, investments, and divestments after hedging for the years 2024-2028 can be summarised as shown in the table.\n\n|                         | Effect of price change   | Effect of price change   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Risk after hedging      |                          |                          |\n| DKKbn                   | +10 %                    | -10 %                    |\n| GBP: 11.6 sell position | +1.2                     | -1.2                     |\n| USD: 4.8 buy position   | -0.5                     | +0.5                     |\n| NTD: 3.2 sell position  | +0.3                     | -0.3                     |\n\n## GBP exposures 1\n\nDKKbn\n\n- Before hedging After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development in currency rates 2\n\n- GBP/DKK USD/DKK\n\nNTD/DKK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The graph shows our GBP exposure before and after hedges from divestments and investments, green certificates, and  hedged energy.\n- 2 The graph shows the historic development in spot currency rates for the past three years and the forward rates for 2024 and 2025 as of 31 December 2023.",

The ineffectiveness is caused by the impairments on our US activities.\n\nThe net position expresses the accounting exposure. If, for example, the GBP/DKK exchange rate increased by 10 % on 31 December 2023, equity would have increased by DKK 3,761 million, corresponding to 10 % of DKK 37,609 million.\n\n## Hedging of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries entail currency risks. We hedge these currency risks by raising loans in foreign currencies and by entering into forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, and options.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the accumulated exchange rate adjustments totalled DKK -3,146 million (2022: DKK -3,054 million), divided between the exchange rate adjustment of the net investment of DKK -1,093 million (2022: DKK -1,544 million) and the hedging thereof of DKK -2,053 million (2022: DKK -1,510 million).\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\n## Hedging of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nChanges in the market value of currency derivatives and currency adjustment of loans that are classified as net investment hedges in foreign subsidiaries or associates are recognised in the consolidated financial statements directly in equity within a separate foreign currency translation reserve.",

A large part of our credit risk is towards major international energy companies, suppliers, and banks. Where possible, the underlying contracts include minimum credit rating clauses, netting provisions, and other risk-mitigating clauses.\n\nWe mitigate our credit risks mainly by:\n\n- \u00b7 having minimum rating requirements\n- \u00b7 monitoring the credit worthiness on the ongoing basis to be able to react in due time\n- \u00b7 requiring that collateral be furnished or credit security put in place.\n\nMitigating our credit risks is not always commercially possible and can be omitted if deemed necessary and balanced. For the most significant counterparties, an internal rating is assigned in connection with establishing credit limits. The rating is based on information from external credit rating agencies, publicly available information, credit risk information systems, and our own analyses.\n\nIn 2023, we have expensed a loan given to our US suppliers in the amount of DKK 571 million, which we do not expect to recover after the termination of Ocean Wind 1 and 2. Apart from this, we have not made any significant impairments on receivables in 2022 or 2023.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nWe only offset positive and negative values if we are entitled to and intend to settle several financial instruments net.",

A number of our derivatives, mainly power purchase agreements, are measured based on unobservable inputs due to the long duration of the contracts.\n\nThe most significant non-observable inputs are the long-term US power prices (mainly ERCOT) and the German power prices.\n\n## Valuation principles and process\n\nIn order to minimise the use of subjective estimates or modifications of parameters and calculation models,\n\nit is our policy to determine fair value based on the external information that most accurately reflects the market values. We use pricing services and benchmark services to increase the data quality. Market values are determined by the Risk Management function.\n\nWe use external price providers to ensure a high quality in our price curves. Where prices are not available, we model the prices based on our prior experience and best estimates. Where relevant and possible, we validate our price curves against third-party data.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nMarket values based on quoted prices comprise  quoted securities and derivatives that are traded in active markets. The market values of derivatives traded in an active market is often settled on a daily basis, thereby minimising the market value presented on the balance sheet.\n\nMarket values based on observable inputs comprise derivatives where valuation models with observable inputs are used to measure fair value.\n\nMarket values based on non-observable inputs mainly comprise long-term power purchase agreements (CPPAs) that lock the power price of the expected power generation over a period of up to 10-20 years. Due to the long duration of these CPPAs, power prices are not observable for a large part of the duration. The most significant non-observable inputs are based on US power prices (mainly ERCOT) and German power prices.\n\n## Estimating as-produced power prices\n\nSince our CPPAs are normally settled on the actual production, and the power prices available in the market are based on a constant production (flat profile), we take into account that our expected production is not constant, and thus our CPPAs will not be settled against a flat profile price (see description of volume risk in note 6.2). For the majority of our markets, the flat profile power price can be observed for a maximum of four to six years in the market, after which an active market no longer exists.",

The power price is  observable for the first four to six years. For the following four to six years, the power price is estimated based on observable inputs (gas prices and heat rates). For the subsequent period, the power price is non- observable and estimated by extrapolating the power price towards the U.S. Energy Information Administration's long-term power price forecast, assuming similar seasonality as in previous periods. As only a minor part of the contract period is within the period when power prices are non-observable, we classify the contracts as based on observable input.\n\nIn Germany and other countries where we have longterm PPA contracts, the power price is observable for up to five years. When power prices are no longer observable in the market, we have estimated the power price by extrapolating the last year with an observable power price, taking expected inflation and seasonality into account.\n\n## Acquired CPPAs\n\nThe initial negative fair value from long-term CPPAs acquired in a business combination is recognised as revenue in profit or loss in the future period to which the market value relates. This effectively increases or decreases the revenue from the contract price to the forward price at the closing date.\n\nIn 2023, we have recognised an income of DKK 197 million (2022: DKK 228 million) related to the initial fair value from CPPAs. The total amount of initial fair value as of 31 December 2023 amounts to a loss of DKK 1,243 million (2022: loss of DKK 1,497 million), which will be recognised as revenue in a future period.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nWhen the fair value at 'initiation recognition' differs from the transaction price, and the fair value is not purely based on observable prices, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred and recognised over the lifetime of the PPA.",

The risks associated with our options are smaller than for our swaps. The market value mostly consists of received exposure from our assets with settlement at maturity, whereas part of the external trade is settled on a daily basis and included with the settled margin.\n\n2\n\n- Trading activities are carried out under mandates approved by the Board of Directors. The mandates comprise a value-at-risk (VaR) mandate and a stress mandate as well as a limit for the maximum positions measured in energy units per product (power, gas, etc.).\n- 3 The graph shows the daily VaR position for the period 2022-2023. VaR reached DKK 280 million on 9 March 2022, causing a passive breach of the Board of Directors' mandate of DKK 100 million due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the large reduction in gas supplies to Europe, causing the European energy prices to spike. In 2022, there were further passive breaches in August due to  Russian gas supply cuts and in September-November due to a halt of gas through the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines after the explosions in September.\n\n## \u00a7  Accounting policies\n\nMarket value adjustments of physical and financial contracts relating to energy that are entered into with the purpose of generating gains from short-term price changes are recognised as revenue.\n\n## Trading portfolio\n\nThe purpose of our trading portfolio is to:\n\n- \u00b7 optimise hedging execution\n- \u00b7 contribute to increased market insight\n- \u00b7 profit from short-term fluctuations in energy prices.\n\nThe energy trading portfolio receives the exposure from our assets and takes that exposure into the external market in the most efficient way possible, given the mandates shown to the left. The overview of the Group's energy trading portfolio to the left is the net of the internal exposures received from the assets and the external trades in line with internal risk management.\n\nThe trading portfolio primarily consists of positions in power and gas.\n\nThe trading portfolio constitutes a smaller part of our total portfolio of derivatives, and the associated risk is limited.",

Likewise, we recognise foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivatives in the income statement as financial income and expenses when they have been entered into hedge net investment in the foreign enterprises.\n\nRental income comprises income from commercial leases and is recognised over the term of the lease. Income from services is recognised when delivery has taken place.\n\n## Dividends from investments\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income statement for the financial year in which the dividends are approved at the annual general meeting. If the dividends exceed the total income after takeover, the dividends are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment under assets.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe measure our investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost. If there is any indication that the value of a company is lower than our future earnings in the company, impairment testing of the company is carried out as described in the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the future earnings in the company (recoverable amount).\n\nIf we have a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries and associates, we recognise a provision for this.\n\n## Tax\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S is taxed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The jointly taxed companies are part of joint taxation with the parent company as the management company.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from the date they are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date on which they are no longer consolidated.\n\nCurrent tax for 2023 is recognised by the individual, jointly taxed companies.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nWe do not prepare a separate statement of cash flows for the parent company. Reference is made to the consolidated statement of cash flows on pages 147-148.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the financial statements, a number of  accounting estimates have been made that affect the profit (loss) and balance sheet. Estimates are regularly reassessed by the management on the basis of historical experience and other relevant  factors.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nIf there is any indication that the carrying amount is lower than our future earnings in a company, we test for impairment as described in the consolidated financial statements. The future earnings of the company (recoverable amount) are calculated based on assumptions concerning significant estimates.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of non-current assets\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nDuring 2023, Management identified impairment indicators for a number of production and development assets (non-current assets) due to, amongst others, the adverse impacts related to the supply chain, increased interest rates, as well as the ability to obtain investment tax credit (ITC) for the US portfolio.\n\nOn this basis, Management has prepared impairment tests resulting in impairment losses recognised for production and development assets; mainly related to the US offshore wind farm portfolio.\n\nThe impairment tests are based on Management's assumptions of expected cash inflows and outflows for the individual cashgenerating units (CGUs), and these cash flows are discounted using the relevant discount rates (value-in-use impairment models). This requires significant estimates and judgements amongst others related to the future power prices, expected government subsidy schemes, impact of the supply chain challenges, cost prices, and discount rates (WACC). Furthermore, some value-in-use models are based on probability-weighted scenarios due to amongst other rebids for offshore renewable energy certificates (ORECs) as well as expected outcome of the supply chain challenges.\n\nFor impairment tests related to the seabeds for Ocean Wind 1 and Skipjack Wind, Management has applied fair value less cost to sell calculations, which are based on multiple analyses supported by discounted cash flow calculations where required data and assumptions are available.\n\nWe focused on this area because impact on the profit for the year is significant and because the impairment tests of non-current assets are considered complex non-routine transactions and require significant, judgements in determining the assumptions applied in the significant estimates.\n\nRefer to notes 1.2 and 3.1-3.2 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit, we challenged the impairment indicator assessments performed by Management. We considered the appropriateness of the CGUs defined by Management and the methodology used by Management to assess the carrying amount of non-current assets assigned to CGUs.\n\nWe carried out risk assessment procedures in order to obtain an understanding of IT systems, business processes, and relevant controls regarding data and assumptions used in the impairment models. For the controls, we assessed whether they were designed and implemented to effectively address the risk of material misstatement. For selected controls that we planned to rely on, we tested whether they were performed on a consistent basis.\n\nWe challenged the impairment models prepared by Management and tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant  value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell models, challenged the data and significant assumptions applied in relation to future selling prices, supply chain challenges, interest rates, as well as the ability to obtain investment tax credits (ITC). Also, we reconciled the carrying amounts to the accounting records.\n\nIn assessing the discounting rates (WACCs) and the overall methodology applied, we involved our valuation specialists.\n\nFinally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures of these matters in the Consolidated Financial Statement, including the sensitivity analysis expressing the significant estimation uncertainty related to the valuation of the CGUs.\n\n## Provisions for onerous contracts\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOn 31 October 2023, \u00d8rsted decided to cease the development of Ocean Wind 1 and recognised a provision for the onerous contracts related to the development project, taking into consideration \u00d8rsteds contractual obligations and the expected outcome of the cancellation of these contracts.\n\nThe provision is based on Management's assessment of the  individual contractual obligations, including termination and compensation clauses, assumptions for cash outflow, as well as cash inflow from sale or reuse of parts of the project. This requires significant estimates and judgements in assessing the potential scenarios and cash flows.\n\nWe focused on this area because impact on the profit for the year is significant, and because the provisions for contractual obligations are considered complex non-routine transactions and require significant judgements in determining the assumptions applied in the significant estimates. Refer to notes 1.2 and 3.10 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit, we read the accounting memorandum prepared, assessed the process applied and competencies involved to identify and review relevant contracts for contractual obligations, read contracts on a sample basis, and obtained relevant formal confirmations from \u00d8rsted's internal lawyers.\n\nFurthermore, we challenged the judgements and assumptions applied by Management when calculating the provision.\n\nFinally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures of these matters in the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

For the controls, we assessed whether they were designed and implemented to effectively address the risk of material misstatement. For selected controls that we planned to rely on, we tested whether they were performed on a consistent basis.\n\nIn this connection, we assessed and obtained an understanding of the exposures subject to hedging, the hedging instruments applied, the hedge relationships, including the methods, data and assumptions applied for documentation of the fair value of hedging instruments, and hedge effectiveness.\n\nWe challenged the accounting treatment applied by Management, including in relation to the hedging instruments used and the hedge reserve recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by reviewing Management's IFRS 9 hedge documentation, including underlying memos and calculations.\n\nWe challenged the significant data, assumptions, and models applied by Management when assessing the value of the hedging instruments, the hedge relationships, and hedge effectiveness by assessing and testing the main data, significant assumptions, and models applied.\n\nAs part of our audit, we tested the valuation of the derivative financial instruments and the documentation of hedge effectiveness of energy, commodity, interest rates, and related foreign exchange risk hedges.\n\nIn assessing the valuation of the derivative financial instruments and application of hedge accounting, we involved our financial instrument  specialists.\n\nWe assessed and tested the appropriateness of the related disclosures provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Income taxes\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n\u00d8rsted is subject to income taxes in the countries where they operate. Significant judgements and estimates are required in determining the income taxes and in measuring income tax assets and liabilities, including uncertain tax positions.\n\nWe focused on this area because Management makes significant judgments and estimates when calculating and assessing the income taxes due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business activities conducted in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, Management makes estimates when measuring the tax assets, including when and to which extent these can be utilised in the future, and when measuring tax liabilities, including assessing deferred taxes in tax equity partnerships.\n\nAdditionally, \u00d8rsted is a party in tax and transfer pricing disputes where Management assesses the possible outcomes and consequently recognise provisions for these uncertain tax positions. \u00d8rsted has received administrative decisions from the Danish Tax Agency entailing additional tax payments and related interests, which Management disputes and has appealed to the relevant authorities. Furthermore, tax cases are ongoing regarding corresponding tax adjustments.\n\nOn this basis, income taxes were a matter of most significance in our audit.\n\nRefer to notes 1.2 and 4.1-4.3 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit, we evaluated the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes, including those related to tax equity partnerships, while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and external advisors.\n\nWe assessed Management's judgements and estimates of tax balances and carrying amounts as well as the related applied tax rates when calculating these. We also assessed the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions used to calculate the taxable income forecasts underlying the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward.\n\nWe evaluated and tested \u00d8rsted's processes for recording, assessing, and continually reassessing provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nDuring our audit of uncertain tax positions, we obtained and reviewed the correspondence with relevant tax authorities to consider the completeness of the tax disputes and the related provisions.\n\nWe assessed the measurement of the provisions and challenged the assumptions used, including the possibility of obtaining  corresponding tax adjustments, compensations from partners, and the likelihood of different outcomes. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the tax disputes, and we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn assessing income taxes, we involved our tax specialists.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control  relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in\n\nthe Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern\n\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 with the filename Orsted-2023-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the  European  Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements including notes.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the preparing of the annual report in XHTML format\n- \u00b7 the selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary\n- \u00b7 ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in human-readable format\n- \u00b7 for such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature,  timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7 testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process\n- \u00b7 evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements including notes\n- \u00b7 evaluating the appropriateness of the  company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified\n- \u00b7 evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy\n- \u00b7 reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 with the file name Orsted-2023-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, 7 February 2024\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Anders Stig Lauritsen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne32800\n\n## Thomas Wraae Holm\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne30141",

        "page_content": "## Independent limited assurance report on selected ESG data in the Sustainability statements\n\nTo the stakeholders of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on selected ESG data as described below for the period 1 January - 31 December 2023 as stated on pages 81-130 and 141 in tables marked with a 'blue eye icon' ( ) (the 'Selected ESG Data').\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the Selected ESG Data in tables marked with a 'blue eye icon' ( ) for the period 1 January - 31 December 2023 for \u00d8rsted A/S are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applied accounting policies developed by \u00d8rsted A/S as stated on pages 81-130 and 141 (the 'Accounting policies').\n\nThis conclusion is to be read in the context of what we state in the remainder of our report.\n\n## What we are assuring\n\nThe scope of our work was limited to assurance over the Selected ESG Data as defined in the first paragraph of our report.\n\nRegarding reporting on article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (EU Taxonomy Regulation) on pages 81-85 we only provide limited assurance on whether the\n\nincluded data have been stated in accordance with the EU Taxonomy related accounting policies as stated on pages 81 and 85, and not whether the data are in compliance with the EU regulation.\n\nWe express limited assurance in our conclusion.\n\n## Professional standards applied and level of assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 'Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements'. The quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine the emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained\n\nin a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence requirements and other ethical requirements in the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional  behavior, and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, ISQM 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.\n\n## Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies\n\nThe Selected ESG Data needs to be read and understood together with the accounting policies. The accounting policies used for the preparation of the Selected ESG Data are the applied accounting policies developed by \u00d8rsted A/S which Management is solely responsible for selecting and applying.\n\nThe absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure ESG data allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected ESG Data. In doing so and based on our  professional judgement, we:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting policies used, their consistent application and related disclosures\n- \u00b7 made inquiries and conducted interviews with Group functions with responsibility for management and reporting of the Selected ESG Data to assess",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\n## Availability\n\nAvailability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors.\n\n## Avoided emissions\n\nThe amount other sources of energy would have emitted if we had not generated energy from renewable sources.\n\n## Awarded capacity\n\nOffshore capacity that we have been awarded in auctions and tenders, but where we have yet to sign a PPA and take final investment decision.\n\n## Blockage effect\n\nThe blockage effect arises from the wind slowing down as it approaches the wind turbines.\n\n## BSUoS tariffs\n\nCosts related to the day-to-day operation of the transmission system imposed on generators and suppliers.\n\n## Carbon emission allowances\n\nCarbon emission allowances subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\n\n## CfD\n\nA contract for difference is a subsidy that guarantees the difference between the market reference price and the exercise price won.\n\n## Commissioning/COD\n\nWhen our assets are in operation, and the legal liability has been transferred from the supplier to us.\n\n## Contracted capacity\n\nOnshore capacity where we have signed PPAs covering more than 50 % of the asset's capacity, but where we have not yet taken final investment decision.\n\n## CSRD\n\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\n## Decided (FID) and installed capacity\n\nInstalled generation capacity plus capacity for assets where a final investment decision has been made.\n\n## Degree days\n\nNumber of degrees in absolute figures in difference between the average temperature and the official Danish indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C.\n\n## DMA\n\nDouble materiality assessment.\n\n## EPC\n\nEngineering, procurement, and construction. The part of our business which handles the construction and installation of assets.\n\n## ESRS\n\nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal investment decision. When the Board of Directors approves major investments for construction assets.\n\n## Generation capacity\n\n\u00d8rsted's ownership of the asset. Offshore wind turbines are included when each turbine has passed the 240-hour test. Onshore capacities are included after COD of the entire asset.\n\n## Green certificates\n\nCertificate awarded to producers of environment-friendly power as a supplement to the market price of power in the given price area.\n\n## Green dark spread (GDS)\n\nRepresents the contribution margin per MWh of power generated at a coal-fired CHP plant with a given efficiency. It is determined as the difference between the market price of power and the cost of the coal (including associated freight costs) and carbon emission allowances used to generate the power.\n\n## Ineffective hedges\n\nWhen we hedge our exposure with an instrument that is not 100 % correlated with the exposure, we may see ineffectiveness in our hedging (i.e. results from such hedges should be recognised in the P&L immediately).\n\n## Installed capacity\n\nInstalled capacity where the asset has been completed and has passed a final test.\n\n## Investment tax credits (ITCs)\n\nFederal tax credit based on qualifying renewable investment costs.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe ratio between the actual power generation in a given period relative to the potential generation which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period.\n\n## Offshore transmission assets\n\nConnect offshore generation to the onshore grid and typically include the offshore power transmission infrastructure, an onshore substation, and the electrical equipment relating to the operation of the substation.\n\n## Overhedging\n\nWhen our hedged volumes are higher than our actual generation, we are overhedged. This is normally caused by lower wind speeds and lead to financial losses if market prices are above our hedged prices.\n\n## Partnership income\n\nIncome originating from our partners' purchase of ownership interests in the offshore wind farms. Includes both the gain in connection with the farm-down and the subsequent construction of the wind farm.\n\n## Power purchase agreement (PPA)\n\nAn agreement between us and a buyer/seller to purchase/sell the power we generate, which includes all commercial terms (price, delivery, volumes, etc.).\n\n## Production tax credit (PTC)\n\nFederal tax credit based on eligible power generation in the US.\n\n## ROCs\n\nRenewable obligation certificates issued by Ofgem in the UK to operators of accredited generating stations for the eligible renewable energy they generate. Operators can trade ROCs with other parties.\n\n## Tax equity\n\nAn arrangement where an investor obtains rights to federal tax credits and other tax attributes in exchange for a cash contribution.\n\n## TCFD\n\nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n\n## TEC\n\nTransmission entry capacity (TEC) defines a generator's maximum contractual level of transmission access in MW.\n\n## TNUoS tariffs\n\nCosts related to the use of the transmission networks in the UK based on TEC.\n\n## TRIR\n\nIn addition to lost-time injuries, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as accidents where the injured person has received medical treatment.\n\n## Wake effect\n\nWake within wind farms and between neighbouring wind farms. There is a wake after each wind turbine where the wind slows down. As the wind flow continues, the wake spreads, and the wind speed recovers.\n\n## Wind speed\n\nShows the wind speed at \u00d8rsted's wind farms. The wind measurements are weighted on the basis of our generation capacity and can be compared to a normal wind period.",
