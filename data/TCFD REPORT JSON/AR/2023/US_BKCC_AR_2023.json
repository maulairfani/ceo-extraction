An unprecedented public need for investment in global infrastructure systems, combined with record government deficits, means that private capital will be needed like never before. This supply-demand imbalance creates compelling investment opportunities for our clients. Infrastructure also offers clients the current cash flow and inflation-protected, long-duration investments they need.\n\nThrough the future integration of BlackRock and GIP, we aim to connect our clients with bigger and better opportunities, while also accelerating growth, diversifying revenue and generating earnings for our shareholders.\n\nWe bring the BlackRock platform strategy to life by delivering access, expertise, the best solutions across all our investment strategies, asset classes and fund structures while embedding our ETF and index expertise across the firm. We also introduced a new International business structure to drive scale, provide unified leadership and allow us to be simultaneously more global and more local in fastgrowing international markets.\n\nand service. And we anticipate our planned acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\") will propel our success in the fast-growing infrastructure market.\n\nThe planned combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform and GIP will provide clients access to investment and operating expertise across the infrastructure landscape. We believe the integrated platform will deliver clients scale and differentiated origination across equity, debt and solutions.\n\nThese two transformational changes are the largest since our acquisition of BGI nearly 15 years ago.",

        "page_content": "## Annual chairman's letter to investors\n\n## Time to rethink retirement\n\nWhen my mom passed away in 2012, my dad started to decline quickly, and my brother and I had to go through my parents' bills and finances.\n\nBoth my mom and dad worked great jobs for 50 years, but they were never in the top tax bracket. My mom taught English at the local state college (Cal Northridge), and my dad owned a shoe store.\n\nI don't know exactly how much they made every year, but in today's dollars, it was probably not more than $150,000 as a couple. So, my brother and I were surprised when we saw the size of our parents' retirement savings. It was an order of magnitude bigger than you'd expect for a couple making their income. And when we finished going over their estate, we learned why: my parents' investments.\n\nMy dad had always been an enthusiastic investor. He encouraged me to buy my first stock (the DuPont chemical company) as a teenager. My dad invested because he knew that whatever money he put in the bond or stock markets would likely grow faster than in the bank. And he was right.\n\nI went back and did the math. If my parents had $1,000 to invest in 1960, and they put that money in the S&P 500, then by the time they'd reached retirement age in 1990, the $1,000 would be worth\n\nnearly $20,000. 1 That's more than double what they would have earned if they'd just put the money in a bank account. My dad passed away a few months after my mom, in his late 80s. But both my parents could have lived beyond 100 and comfortably afforded it.\n\nWhy am I writing about my parents? Because going over their finances showed me something about my own career in finance. I had been working at BlackRock for almost 25 years by the time I lost my mom and dad, but the experience reminded me - in a new and very personal way - why my business partners and I founded BlackRock in the first place.\n\nObviously, we were ambitious entrepreneurs, and we wanted to build a big, successful company. But we also wanted to help people retire like my parents did. That's why we started an asset manager - a company that helps people invest in the capital markets - because we believed participating in those markets was going to be crucial for people who wanted to retire comfortably and financially secure.\n\nWe also believed the capital markets would become a bigger and bigger part of the global economy. If more people could invest in the capital markets, it would create a virtuous economic cycle, fueling growth for companies and countries, which would, in turn,\n\ngenerate wealth for millions more people.\n\nMy parents lived their final years with dignity and financial freedom. Most people don't have that chance. But they can. The same kinds of markets that helped my parents in their time can help others in our time. Indeed, I think the growth- and prosperitygenerating power of the capital markets will remain a dominant economic trend through the rest of the 21st Century.\n\nThis letter attempts to explain why.\n\n## A brief (and admittedly incomplete) history of U.S. capital markets\n\nIn finance, there are two basic ways to get or grow money.\n\nOne is the bank, which is what most people historically relied on. They deposited their savings to earn interest or took out loans to buy a home or expand their business. But over time a second avenue for financing arose, particularly in the U.S., with the growth of the capital markets: publicly traded stocks, bonds, and other securities.\n\nI saw this firsthand in the late 1970s and early 1980s when I played a role in the creation of the securitization market for mortgages.\n\nBefore the 1970s, most people secured financing for their homes the same way they did in the Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life - through the Building & Loan (B&L). Customers deposited their savings into the B&L, which was essentially a bank. Then that bank would turn around and lend out those savings in the form of mortgages.\n\nIn the movie - and in real life everything works fine until people start lining up at the bank's front door asking for their deposits back. As Jimmy Stewart explained in the film, the bank didn't have their money. It was tied up in somebody else's house.\n\nAfter the Great Depression, B&Ls morphed into savings & loans (S&Ls), which had their own crisis in the 1980s. Approximately half of the outstanding home mortgages in the U.S. were held by S&Ls in 1980, and poor risk management and loose lending practices led to a raft of failures costing U.S. taxpayers more than $100 billion dollars. 2\n\nBut the S&L crisis didn't cause the American economy lasting damage. Why? Because at the same time the S&Ls were collapsing another method of financing was getting stronger. The capital markets were providing an avenue to channel capital back to challenged real estate markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "This was mortgage securitization.\n\nSecuritization allowed banks not just to make mortgages but to sell them. By selling mortgages, banks could better manage risk on their balance sheets and have capital to lend to home buyers, which is why the S&L crisis didn't severely impact American homeownership.\n\nEventually, the excesses of mortgage securitization contributed to the crash in 2008, and unlike the S&L crisis, the Great Recession did harm home ownership in the U.S. The country still hasn't fully recovered in that respect. But the broader underlying trend - the expansion of the capital markets - was still very helpful for the American economy.\n\n## In fact, it's worth considering: Why did the U.S. rebound from 2008 faster than almost any other developed nation? 3\n\n## A big part of the answer is the country's capital markets.\n\nIn Europe, where most assets were kept in banks, economies froze as banks were forced to shrink their balance sheets. Of course, U.S. banks had to tighten capital standards and pull back from lending as well. But because the U.S. had a more robust secondary pool of money - the capital markets - the nation was able to recover much more quickly.\n\nToday public equities and bonds provide over 70% of financing for non-financial corporations in the U.S. - more than any other country in the world. In China, for example, the bank-to-capital market ratio is almost flipped. Chinese companies rely on bank loans for 65% of their financing. 4\n\nIn my opinion, this is the most important lesson in recent\n\neconomic history: Countries aiming for prosperity don't just need strong banking systems - they also need strong capital markets.\n\nThat lesson is now spreading around the world.\n\n## Replicating the success of America's capital markets\n\nLast year, I spent a lot of days on the road, logging visits to 17 different countries. I met with clients and employees. I also met with many policymakers and heads of state, and during those meetings, the most frequent conversation I had was about the capital markets.\n\n## More and more countries recognize the power of American capital markets and want to build their own.\n\nOf course, many countries do have capital markets already. There are something like 80 stock exchanges around the world, everywhere from Kuala Lumpur to Johannesburg. 5 But most of these are rather small, with little investment. They're not as robust as the markets in the U.S., and that's what other nations are increasingly looking for.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, for example, the government is interested in building a market for mortgage securitization while Japan and India want to give people new places to put their savings. Today, in Japan, it's mostly the bank. In India, it's often in gold.\n\nWhen I visited India in November, I met policymakers who lamented their fellow citizens' fondness for gold. The commodity has\n\n## Asking the old age question: How do we afford longer lives?\n\nLast year, Japan passed a demographic milestone. The country's population has been aging since the early 1990s as the pool of working-age people has shrunk and the number of elderly has risen. But 2023 was the first time that 10% of their people exceeded 80 years old, 6 making Japan the 'oldest country in the world' 7 according to the United Nations.\n\nlives. They'll need more money. The capital markets can provide it so long as governments and companies help people invest.\n\n## 2 A second challenge is infrastructure. How are we going to build the massive amount the world needs?\n\nAs countries decarbonize and digitize their economies, they're supercharging demand for all sorts of infrastructure, from telecom networks to new ways to generate power. In fact, in my nearly 50 years in finance, I've never seen more demand for energy infrastructure. And that's because many countries have twin aims: They want to transition to lower-carbon sources of power while also achieving energy security. The capital markets can help countries meet their energy goals, including decarbonization, in an affordable way.\n\nThis is part of the reason the Japanese government is making a push for retirement investment.\n\nMost Japanese keep the bulk of their retirement savings in banks, earning a low interest rate. It wasn't such a bad strategy when Japan was suffering from deflation, but now the country's economy has turned around, with the NIKKEI surging past 40,000 for the first time this month (March 2024). 8\n\nMost aspiring retirees are missing out on the upswing. The country didn't have anything resembling a 401(k) program until 2001, but even then, the amount of income people could contribute was quite low. So a decade ago, the government launched the Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA) to encourage people to invest even more in retirement. Now they're trying to double NISA's\n\n## As populations age, building retirement savings has never been more urgent\n\nSource: Working-age population (ages 15-64): UN 'medium trend' 9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nunderperformed the Indian stock market, proving a subpar investment for individual investors. Nor has investing in gold helped the country's economy.\n\nCompare investing in gold with, let's say, investing in a new house. When you buy a home, that creates an economic multiplier effect because you need to furnish and repair the house. Maybe you have a family and fill the house with children. All that generates economic activity. Even when someone puts their money in a bank, there's a multiplier effect because the bank can use that money to fund a mortgage. But gold? It just sits in a safe. It can be a good store of value, but gold doesn't generate economic growth.\n\nThis is a small illustration - but a good one - of what countries want to accomplish with robust capital markets. (Or rather, of what they can't accomplish without them).\n\nDespite the anti-capitalist strain in our modern politics, most world leaders still see the obvious: No other force can lift more people from poverty or improve quality of life quite like capitalism. No other economic model can help us achieve our highest hopes for financial freedom - whether we want it for ourselves or our country.\n\nThat's why the capital markets will be key to addressing two of the mid-21st Century's biggest economic challenges.\n\n1\n\nThe first is providing people what my parents built over time - a secure, well-earned retirement. This is a\n\nmuch harder proposition than it was 30 years ago. And it'll be a much harder proposition 30 years from now . People are living longer",

The goal is 34 million Japanese investors before the end of the decade. 10 It will require the Japanese government to expand their capital markets, which historically had very little retail participation.\n\nJapan isn't alone in helping more of its citizens invest for retirement. BlackRock has a joint venture Jio BlackRock - with Jio Financial Services, an affiliate of India's Reliance Industries. Over the past 10 years, India has built a huge digital public infrastructure network that connects nearly one billion Indians to everything from healthcare to government payments via their smartphones. Jio BlackRock's goal is to use the same infrastructure to deliver retirement investing (and more).\n\nAfter all, India is aging, too. The whole world is, albeit at different speeds. Brazil will start seeing more people leave its workforce than enter it by 2035; Mexico will reach peak workforce by 2040; India sometime around 2050.\n\nBy the mid-century mark, onein-six people globally will be over the age of 65, up from onein-11 in 2019. 11 To support them, governments are going to have to prioritize building out robust capital markets like the U.S. has.\n\nBut this isn't to say the U.S. retirement system is perfect. I'm not sure anybody believes that. The retirement system in America needs modernizing, at the very least.\n\n## Rethinking retirement in the United States\n\nThis was particularly clear last year as the biotech industry pumped out a rush of new, life-extending drugs. Obesity, for example, can take more than 10 years off someone's life expectancy, which is why some researchers think that new pharmaceuticals like Ozempic and Wegovy can be life-extending drugs, not just weight-loss drugs. 12 In fact, a recent study shows that semaglutide, the generic name for Ozempic, can give people with cardiovascular disease an extra two years of life where they don't suffer a major condition like a heart attack. 13\n\nThese drugs are breakthroughs. But they underscore a frustrating\n\nirony: As a society, we focus a tremendous amount of energy on helping people live longer lives. But not even a fraction of that effort is spent helping people afford those extra years.\n\nIt wasn't always this way. One reason my parents had a financially secure retirement was CalPERS, California's state pension system. As a public university employee, my mom could enroll. But pension enrollment has been declining across the country since the 1980s. 14 Meanwhile the federal government has prioritized maintaining entitlement benefits for people my age (I'm 71) even though it might mean that Social Security will struggle to meet its full obligations when younger workers retire.\n\n## The demographics don't lie\n\nThere's a popular saying in economics: 'You just can't fight demographics.' And yet, when it comes to retirement, the U.S. is trying anyway.\n\nIn wealthy countries, most retirement systems have three pillars. One is what people invest personally (my dad putting his money in the stock market). Another is the plans provided by employers (my mom's CalPERS pension). A third component is what we hear politicians mostly talking about - the government safety net. In the U.S., this is Social Security.\n\nYou're probably familiar with the economics behind Social Security. During your working years, the government takes a portion of your income, then after you retire, it sends you a check every month. The idea actually originates from preWorld War I Germany, and these 'old-age insurance' programs gradually became popular over the 20th Century largely because the demographics made sense.\n\nThink about someone who was 65 years old in 1952, the year I was born. If he hadn't retired already, that person was probably getting ready to stop working.\n\nMore than half the assets BlackRock manages are for retirement. 15 We help about 35 million Americans invest for life after work, 16 which amounts to about a quarter of the country's workers. 17 Many are educators like my mom was. BlackRock helps manage pension assets for roughly half of U.S. public school teachers. 18 And this work - and our similar work around the globe - has given us some insight into how a national initiative to modernize retirement might begin.\n\nWe think the conversation starts by looking at the challenge through three different lenses.\n\n- \u00b7 What's the issue from the perspective of a current worker , someone who's still trying to save for retirement?\n- \u00b7 What about someone who has already retired? We have to look at the problem from the retiree's point-of-view - an individual who has already saved enough to stop working but is worried the money will run out.\n- \u00b7 But first it's important to look at retirement in America like you'd look at a map of America - a high-level picture of the problem, the kind a national policymaker might look at. What's the issue for the population as a whole? (It's demographics).\n\nBut now think about that person's former colleagues, all the people around his age who he'd entered the workforce with back in the 1910s. The data shows that in 1952, most of those people were not preparing for retirement because they'd already passed away .\n\nThis is how the Social Security program functioned: More than half the people who worked and paid into the system never lived to retire and be paid from the system. 19\n\nToday, these demographics have completely unraveled, and this unraveling is obviously a wonderful thing. We should want more people to live more years. But we can't overlook the massive impact on the country's retirement system.\n\nIt's not just that more people are retiring in America; it's also that their retirements are increasing in length. Today, if you're married and both you and your spouse are over the age of 65, there's a 50/50 chance at least one of you will be receiving a Social Security check until you're 90. 20\n\nAll this is putting the U.S. retirement system under immense strain. The Social Security Administration itself says that by 2034, it won't be able to pay people their full benefits. 21\n\nWhat's the solution here? No one should have to work longer than\n\nIt's no wonder younger generations, Millennials and Gen Z, are so economically anxious. They believe my generation - the Baby Boomers - have focused on their own financial well-being to the detriment of who comes next. And in the case of retirement, they're right.\n\nToday in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: 'You're on your own.' And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.\n\nMaybe once a decade, the U.S. faces a problem so big and urgent that government and corporate leaders stop business as usual. They step out of their silos and sit around the same table to find a solution. I participated in something like this after 2008, when the government needed to find a way to unwind the toxic assets from the mortgage crisis. More recently, tech CEOs and the federal government came together to address the fragility of America's semiconductor supply chain. We need to do something similar for the retirement crisis. America needs an organized, highlevel effort to ensure that future generations can live out their final years with dignity.\n\nWhat should that national effort do? I don't have all the answers. But what I do have is some data and the beginnings of a few ideas from BlackRock's work. Because our core business is retirement.",

It will now automatically adjust as the country's life expectancy changes. 22\n\nObviously, implementing this policy elsewhere would be a massive political undertaking. But my point is that we should start having the conversation. When people are regularly living past 90, what should the average retirement age be?\n\nOr rather than pushing back when people receive retirement benefits, perhaps there's a more politically palatable idea: How do we encourage more people who wish to work longer, with carrots rather than sticks? What if the government and the private sector treated 60-plus-yearolds as late-career workers with\n\nmuch to offer rather than people who should retire?\n\nOne way Japan has managed its aging economy is by doing exactly this. They've found new ways to boost the labor force participation rate, a metric that has been declining in the U.S. since the early 2000s. 23 It's worth asking: How can America stop (or at least, slow) that trend?\n\nAgain, I'm not pretending to have the answers. Despite BlackRock's success helping millions retire, these questions are going to have to be posed to a broader\n\n## Global Executive Committee\n\n| Laurence D.

Zero in an IRA or 401(k).\n\nWhy? Well, the first barrier to retirement investing is affordability .\n\nFour-in-10 Americans don't have $400 to spare to cover an emergency like a car repair or hospital visit. 25 Who is going to invest money for a retirement 30 years away if they don't have cash for today? No one. That's why BlackRock's foundation has worked with a group of nonprofits to set up\n\n| Philipp Hildebrand Vice Chairman         | John Kelly Global Head of   Corporate Affairs   | J.

But financing retirement isn't so intuitive. The better analogy is if someone dropped a bunch of engine and auto parts in your driveway and said, 'Figure it out.'\n\nAt BlackRock, we've tried to make the investing process more intuitive by inventing simpler products like target date funds. They only require people to make one decision: What year do they expect to retire? Once people choose their 'target date,'\n\nthe fund automatically adjusts their portfolio, shifting from higherreturn equities to less risky bonds as retirement approaches. 28\n\nIn 2023, BlackRock expanded the types of target date ETFs we offer so people can more easily buy them even if they don't work for employers offering a retirement plan. There are 57 million people like this in America - farmers, gig workers, restaurant employees, independent contractors - who don't have access to a defined contribution plan. 29 And while better investment products can help, there are limits to what something\n\nlike a target date fund can do. Indeed, for most people, the data shows that the hardest part of retirement investing is just getting started.\n\nOther nations make things simpler for their part-time and contract workers. In Australia, employers must contribute a portion of income for every worker between the ages of 18 and 70 into a retirement account, which then belongs to the employee. The Superannuation Guarantee was introduced in 1992 when the country seemed like it was on the path to a retirement crisis. Thirtytwo years later, Australians likely\n\n- 28.

The nation has the world's 54th largest population, 30 but the 4th largest retirement system. 31\n\nOf course, every country is different, so every retirement system should be different. But Australia's experience with Supers could be a good model for American policymakers to study and build on. Some already are. There are about 20 U.S. states - like Colorado and Virginia - that have instituted retirement systems to cover all workers like Australia does, even if they're gig or part-time. 32\n\nIt's a good thing that legislators are proposing different bills and states are becoming 'laboratories of retirement.' More should consider it. The benefits could be enormous for individual retirees. These new programs could also help the U.S. ensure the longterm solvency of Social Security. That's what Australia found - their Superannuation Guarantee relieved the financial tension in their country's public pension program. 33\n\nBut what about workers who do have access to an employer retirement plan? They need support too.\n\n- 30. CIA: The World Factbook , Country Comparisons: Population (2023 est.)\n\n- 32.

        "page_content": "Are people automatically enrolled in a plan or not? And how much are they auto-enrolled to contribute? Is it a minimum percentage of their income? Or the maximum?\n\nIn 2017, the University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize, in part, for his pioneering work around 'nudges' - small changes in policy that can have enormous impact in people's financial lives. Auto-enrollment is one of them. Studies show that the simple step of making enrollment automatic increases retirement plan participation by nearly 50%. 34\n\nAs a nation, we should do everything we can to make retirement investing more automatic for workers. And there are already bright spots. Next year, a new federal law will kick in, requiring employers that set up new 401(k) plans to auto-enroll their new workers. Plus, there are hundreds of major companies (including BlackRock) that have already taken this step voluntarily.\n\nBut firms can do even more to improve their employee's financial lives, such as providing some level of matching funds for retirement plans and offering more financial education on the tremendous long-term difference between contributing a small percentage of your income to retirement versus the maximum. I also think we should make it easier for workers to transfer their 401(k) savings when they switch jobs. There is a menu of options here, and we need to explore all of them.\n\n## For retirees, help them spend what they saved\n\nIn 2018, BlackRock commissioned a study of 1,150 American retirees. When we dug into the data, we found something unexpected even paradoxical.\n\nThe survey showed that after nearly two decades of retirement, the average person still had 80% of their pre-retirement money saved. We're talking about people who were probably between the ages of 75 and 95. If they had invested for retirement, they were likely sitting on more than enough money for the rest of their lives. And yet the data also showed that they were anxious about their finances. Only 32% reported feeling comfortable about spending what they saved. 35\n\n## This retirement paradox has a simple explanation: Even people who know how to save for retirement still don't know how to spend for it.\n\nIn the U.S., this problem's roots stretch back more than four decades when employers began switching from defined benefit plans - pensions - to defined contribution plans like 401(k)s.\n\nIn a lot of ways, pensions were much simpler than the 401(k). You had a job somewhere for 20 or 30 years. Then when you retired, your pension paid you a set amount a defined benefit - every month.\n\nWhen I entered the workforce in the 1970s, 38% of Americans had one of these defined benefit plans, but by 2008 the percentage had been cut almost in half. 36 Meanwhile,\n\nIn finance, we sometimes think of 'fear' as a fuzzy, emotional concept - not as a hard economic data point. But that's what it is. Fear is as important and actionable a metric as GDP. After all, investment (or lack thereof) is just a measure of fear because no one lets their money sit in a stock or a bond for 30 or 40 years if they're afraid the future is going to be worse than the present. That's when they put their money in a bank. Or underneath the mattress.\n\nThis is what happens in many countries. In China, where new surveys show consumer confidence has dropped to its lowest level in decades, household savings have reached their highest level on record - nearly $20 trillion - according to the central bank. 39 China has a savings rate of about 30%. Nearly a third of all money earned is socked away in cash in case it's needed for harder times ahead. The U.S., by comparison, has a savings rate in the single digits. 40\n\nAmerica has rarely been a fearful country. Hope has been the nation's greatest economic asset. People put their money in American markets for the same reason they invest in their homes and businesses - because they believe this country will be better tomorrow than it is today.\n\nThis big, hopeful America has been the one I've known my whole life, but over the past few years, especially as I've had more grandchildren, I've started to ask myself: Will they know this version of America, too?\n\nAs I was finishing this letter, The Wall Street Journal published an article that caught my attention. It was titled 'The Rough Years that Turned Gen Z into America's Most Disillusioned Voters,' and it\n\nPut simply, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution has been, for most people, a shift from financial certainty to financial un certainty.\n\nThat's why around the same time we saw the data that retirees were nervous about spending their savings, we started wondering: Was there something we could do about it? Could we develop an investment strategy that provided the flexibility of a 401(k) investment but also the potential for a predictable, paycheck-like income stream, similar to a pension?\n\nIt turns out, we could. That strategy is called LifePath Paycheck\u2122, which will go live in April. As I write this, 14 retirement plan sponsors are planning to make LifePath Paycheck\u2122 available to 500,000 employees. I believe it will one day be the most used investment strategy in defined contribution plans.\n\nWe're talking about a revolution in retirement. And while it may happen in the U.S. first, eventually other countries will benefit from the innovation as well. At least, that is my hope. Because while retirement is mainly a saving challenge, the data is clear: It's a spending one too.\n\n## Fear vs. hope\n\nBefore I conclude this section on retirement, I want to share a few words about one of the largest barriers to investing for the future. In my view, it's not just affordability or complexity or the fact that people are too busy to enroll in their employer's plan.\n\nArguably the biggest barrier to investing for retirement - or for anything - is fear.\n\nincluded some eye-catching - and really disheartening - data.\n\nThe article showed that from the mid-1990s through most of the early 21st Century, most young people - around 60% of high school seniors, to be specific believed they'd earn a professional degree, would land a good job, and go on to be wealthier than their parents. They were optimistic. But since the pandemic, that optimism has fallen precipitously.\n\nCompared with 20 years ago, the current cohort of young Americans is 50% more likely to question whether life has a purpose. Fourin-10 say it's 'hard to have hope for the world.' 41\n\nI've been working in finance for almost 50 years. I've seen a lot of numbers. But no single data point has ever concerned me more than this one.\n\nThe lack of hope worries me as a CEO. It worries me as a grandfather. But most of all, it worries me as an American.\n\nIf future generations don't feel hopeful about this country and their future in it, then the U.S. doesn't only lose the force that makes people want to invest. America will lose what makes it America. Without hope, we risk becoming just another place where people look at the incentive structure before them and decide that the safe choice is the only choice. We risk becoming a country where people keep their money under the mattress and their dreams bottled up in their bedroom.\n\n## How do we get our hope back?\n\nWhether we're trying to solve retirement or any other problem, that is the first question we have to ask, although I readily admit\n\nthe fraction of Americans with defined contribution plans almost quadrupled. 37\n\nThis should have been a good thing. Beginning with the Baby Boomers, fewer and fewer workers spent their entire careers in one place, meaning they needed a retirement option that would follow them from job to job. In theory, 401(k)s did that. But in practice? Not really.\n\nAnyone who's switched jobs knows how unintuitive it is to transfer your retirement savings. In fact, studies show that about 40% of employees cash out their 401(k)s when they switch jobs, putting themselves back at the starting line for retirement savings. 38\n\nThe real drawback of defined contribution was that it removed most of the retirement responsibility from employers and put it squarely on the shoulders of the employees themselves. With pensions, companies had a very clear obligation to their workers. Their retirement money was a financial liability on the corporate balance sheet. Companies knew they'd have to write a check every month to each one of their retirees. But defined contribution plans ended that, forcing retirees to trade a steady stream of income for an impossible math problem.\n\nBecause most defined contribution accounts don't come with instructions for how much you can take out every month, individual savers first must build up a nestegg, then spend down at a rate that will last them the rest of their lives. But who really knows how long that will be?",

There's so much anger and division, and I often struggle to wrap my head around it.\n\nWhat I do know is that any answer has to start by bringing young people into the fold. The same surveys that show their lack of hope also show their lack of confidence - far less than any previous generation in every pillar of society: in politics, government, the media, and in corporations. Leaders of these institutions (I am one) should be empathetic to their concerns.\n\nYoung people have lost trust in older generations. The burden is on us to get it back. And maybe investing for their long-term goals, including retirement, isn't such a bad place to begin.\n\nPerhaps the best way to start building hope is by telling young people, 'You may not feel very hopeful about your future. But we do. And we're going to help you invest in it.'\n\n## The new infrastructure blueprint: steel, concrete, and public-private partnership\n\nI started traveling to London in the 1980s, and back then, if you had a choice between the city's two major\n\ninternational airports - Heathrow or Gatwick - you probably chose Heathrow. Gatwick was farther from the city. It was also in a comparative state of disrepair.\n\nBut things changed in 2009 when Gatwick was purchased by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). They increased runway capacity and instituted commonsense changes, like oversized luggage trays that cut security screening times by more than half.\n\n'The thing about infrastructure businesses\u2026 is a lot of them tend not to focus on customer service,' GIP's CEO Bayo Ogunlesi told the Financial Times . GIP wanted to make Gatwick different. In the process, they also turned the airport into a prime example of how infrastructure will be built and run in the 21st Century - with private capital. 42\n\nIn the U.S., people tend to think of infrastructure as a government endeavor, something built with taxpayer funds. But because of one very big reason that I'll dive into momentarily, that won't be the primary way infrastructure is built in the mid-21st Century. Rather than only tapping government treasuries to build bridges, power grids, and airports, the world will do what Gatwick did.\n\n## The future of infrastructure is public-private partnership.\n\n## Debt matters\n\nThe $1 trillion infrastructure sector is one of the fastest growing segments of the private markets, and there are some undeniable macroeconomic trends driving this growth. In developing countries,\n\npeople are getting richer, boosting demand for everything from energy to transportation while in wealthy countries, governments need to both build new infrastructure and repair the old.\n\nEven in the U.S., where the Biden Administration has signed generational infrastructure investments into law, there's still $2 trillion worth of deferred maintenance. 43\n\nHow will we pay for all this infrastructure? The reason I believe it'll have to be some combination of public and private dollars is that funding probably cannot come from the government alone. The debt is just too high.\n\nFrom Italy to South Africa, many nations are suffering the highest debt burdens in their history. Public debt has tripled since the mid-1970s, reaching 92% of global GDP in 2022. 44 And in America, the situation is more urgent than I can ever remember. Since the start of the pandemic, the U.S. has issued roughly $11.1 trillion of new debt, 45 and the amount is only part of the issue. There's also the interest rate the Treasury needs to pay on it.\n\nThree years ago, the rate on a 10year Treasury bill was under 1%. But as I write this, it's over 4%, and that 3-percentage-point increase is very dangerous. Should the current rates hold, it amounts to an extra trillion dollars in interest payments over the next decade. 46\n\nWhy is this debt a problem now? Because historically, America has paid for old debt by issuing new debt in the form of Treasury securities. It's a workable strategy so long as people want to buy those\n\ntheir focus. We can't see debt as a problem that can be solved only through taxing and spending cuts anymore. Instead, America's debt efforts have to center around progrowth policies , which include tapping the capital markets to build one of the best catalysts for growth: infrastructure. Especially energy infrastructure.\n\n## Energy pragmatism\n\nRoads. Bridges. Ports. Airports. Cell towers. The infrastructure sector contains multitudes, but the multitude where BlackRock sees arguably the greatest demand for new investment is energy infrastructure.\n\nWhy energy? Two things are happening in the sector at the same time.\n\nThe first is the 'energy transition.' It's a mega force, a major economic trend being driven by nations representing 90% of the world's GDP. 48 With wind and solar power now cheaper in many places than fossil-fuel-generated electricity, these countries are increasingly installing renewables. 49 It's also a major way to address climate change. This shift - or energy transition - has created a ripple effect in the markets, creating both risks and opportunities for investors, including BlackRock's clients.\n\nI started writing about the transition in 2020. Since then, the issue has become more contentious in the U.S. But outside that debate, much is still the same. People are still investing heavily in decarbonization. In Europe, for\n\nsecurities - but going forward, the U.S. cannot take for granted that investors will want to buy them in such volume or at the premium they currently do.\n\nToday, around 30% 47 of U.S. Treasury securities are held by foreign governments or investors. That percentage will likely go down as more countries build their own capital markets and invest domestically.\n\nMore leaders should pay attention to America's snowballing debt. There's a bad scenario where the American economy starts looking like Japan's in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when debt exceeded GDP and led to periods of austerity and stagnation. A high-debt America would also be one where it's much harder to fight inflation since monetary policymakers could not raise rates without dramatically adding to an already unsustainable debt-servicing bill.\n\nBut is a debt crisis inevitable? No.\n\nWhile fiscal discipline can help tame debt on the margins, it will be very difficult (both politically and mathematically) to raise taxes or cut spending at the level America would need to dramatically reduce the debt. But there is another way out beyond taxing or cutting, and that's growth . If U.S. GDP grows at an average of 3% (in real, not nominal terms) over the next five years, that would keep the country's debt-to-GDP ratio at 120% high, but reasonable.\n\nI should be clear: 3% growth is a very tall order, especially given the country's aging workforce. It will require policymakers to shift\n\nexample, net-zero remains a top investment priority for most of BlackRock's clients. 50 But now the demand for clean energy is being amplified by something else: a focus on energy security .\n\nGovernments have been pursuing energy security since the oil crisis of the 1970s (and probably as far back as the early Industrial Revolution), so this is not a new trend. In fact, when I wrote my original 2020 letter about sustainability, I also wrote to our clients that countries would still need to produce oil and gas to meet their energy needs.\n\nTo be energy secure, I wrote, most parts of the globe would need 'to rely on hydrocarbons for a number of years.' 51\n\nThen in 2022, Putin invaded Ukraine. The war lit a fresh spark under the idea of energy security. It disrupted the world's supply of oil and gas causing massive energy inflation, particularly in Europe. The UK, Norway, and the 27 EU countries had to collectively spend 800 billion euros subsidizing energy bills. 52\n\nThis is part of the reason I'm hearing more leaders talk about decarbonization and energy security together under the joint banner of what you might call 'energy pragmatism.'\n\nLast year, as I mentioned, I visited 17 countries, and I spent a lot of time talking to the people who are responsible for powering homes and businesses, everybody from prime ministers to energy grid operators. The message I heard was completely opposite to what",

        "page_content": "you often hear from activists on the far left and right who say that countries have to choose between renewables and oil and gas. These leaders believe that the world still needs both. They were far more pragmatic about energy than dogmatic. Even the most climate conscious among them saw that their long-term path to decarbonization will include hydrocarbons, albeit it less of them, for some time to come.\n\nGermany is a good example of how energy pragmatism is still a path to decarbonization. It's one of the countries most committed to fighting climate change and has made enormous investments in wind and solar power. But sometimes the wind doesn't blow in Berlin, and the sun doesn't shine in Munich. And during those windless, sunless periods, the country still needs to rely on natural gas for 'dispatchable power.' Germany used to get that gas from Russia, but now it needs to look elsewhere. So, they're building additional gas facilities to import from other producers around the world. 53\n\nOr look at Texas. They face a similar energy challenge - not because of Russia but because of the economy. The state is one of the fastest growing in the U.S., 54 and the additional demand for power is stretching ERCOT, Texas' energy grid, to the limit. 55\n\nToday, Texas runs on 28% renewable energy 56 - 6% more than the U.S. as a whole. 57 But without an additional 10 gigawatts of dispatchable power, which might\n\nneed to come partially from natural gas, the state could continue to suffer devastating brownouts. In February, BlackRock helped convene a summit of investors and policymakers in Houston to help find a solution.\n\nTexas and Germany are great illustrations of what the energy transition looks like. As I wrote in 2020, the transition will only succeed if it's 'fair.' Nobody will support decarbonization if it means giving up heating their home in the winter or cooling it in the summer. Or if the cost of doing so is prohibitive.\n\nSince 2020, economists have popularized better language to describe what a fair transition actually means. One important concept is the 'green premium.' It's the surcharge people pay for 'going green': For example, switching from a car that runs on gas to an electric vehicle. The lower the green premium, the fairer decarbonization will be because it'll be more affordable.\n\nThis is where the power of the capital markets can be unleashed to great effect. Private investment can help energy companies reduce the cost of their innovations and scale them around the world. Last year, BlackRock invested in over a dozen of these transition projects on behalf of our clients. We partnered with developers in Southeast Asia aiming to build over a gigawatt of solar capacity (enough to power a city) in both Thailand and the Philippines. 58 We also invested in Lake Turkana Wind\n\nPower, Africa's largest windfarm. It's located in Kenya and currently accounts for about 12% of the country's power generation. 59\n\nThere are also earlier-stage technologies, like a giant 'hot rock' battery being built by Antora Energy. The company heats up blocks of carbon with wind or solar power during parts of the day when renewable energy is cheap and abundant. These 'thermal batteries' reach up to 2,400 degrees Celsius and glow brighter than the sun. 60 Then, that heat is used to power giant industrial facilities around-the-clock, even when the sun isn't shining, or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nBlackRock invested in Antora through Decarbonization Partners, a partnership we have with the investment firm, Temasek. Our funding will help Antora scale up to deliver billions of dollars worth of zero-emission energy to industrial customers. 61 (One day, their thermal batteries might help solve the kind of dispatchable power problem that Texas and Germany are facing but without carbon emissions).\n\nThe final technology I'll spotlight is carbon capture. Last year, one of BlackRock's infrastructure funds invested $550 million in a project called STRATOS, which will be the world's largest direct air capture facility when construction is completed in 2025. 62 Among the more interesting aspects of the project is who's building the facility: Occidental Petroleum, the big Texas oil company.\n\nmodern infrastructure investing in the private markets.\n\n## BlackRock's next transformation\n\nOne way we're helping our clients navigate the booming infrastructure market is by transforming our company. I began this section by writing about the owners of Gatwick Airport, GIP. In January, BlackRock announced our plans to acquire them.\n\nWhy GIP? BlackRock's own infrastructure business had been growing rapidly over the past several years. But to meet demand, we realized we needed to grow even faster.\n\nIt's not just debt-strapped governments that need to find alternate pools of financing for their infrastructure. Private sector firms do too. All over the world, there's a vast infrastructure footprint that's owned and operated entirely by private companies. Cell towers are a good example. So are pipelines that deliver the feedstocks for chemical companies. Increasingly, the owners of these assets prefer to have a financing partner, rather than carrying the full cost for the infrastructure on their balance sheet.\n\nI had been thinking about this trend and called an old colleague, Bayo Ogunlesi.\n\nBoth Bayo and I started our careers in finance at the investment bank First Boston. But our paths diverged. I lost $100 million on a series of bad trades at First Boston and\u2026well, nobody needs to hear that story again. But it led me (and my BlackRock partners) to pioneer better risk management for fixed income markets. Meanwhile, Bayo and his team were pioneering\n\nNow, we plan to join our forces again. I think the result will be better opportunities for our clients to invest in the infrastructure that keeps our lights on, planes flying, trains moving, and our cell service at the maximum number of bars.\n\n## More about BlackRock's work in 2023\n\nIn this letter, I've shared my view that the capital markets are going to play an even bigger role in the global economy. They'll have to if the world wants to address the challenges around infrastructure, debt, and retirement. These are the major economic issues of the mid-21st Century. We're going to need the power of capitalism to solve them.\n\nThe way BlackRock figures into that story is through our work with clients. We want to position them well to navigate these trends, which is why we've tried to stay more connected to our clients than ever.\n\nOver the past five years, thousands of clients on behalf of millions of individuals have entrusted BlackRock with managing over $1.9 trillion in net new assets. Thousands also use our technology to better understand the risks in their portfolios and support the growth and commercial agility of their own businesses. Years of organic growth, alongside the long-term growth of the capital markets, underpin our $10 trillion\n\nThe energy market isn't divided the way some people think, with a hard split between oil & gas producers on one side and new clean power and climate tech firms on the other. Many companies, like Occidental, do both, which is a major reason BlackRock has never supported divesting from traditional energy firms. They're pioneers of decarbonization, too.\n\nToday, BlackRock has more than $300 billion invested in traditional energy firms on behalf of our clients. Of that $300 billion, more than half - $170 billion - is in the U.S. 63 We invest in these energy companies for one simple reason: It's our clients' money. If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients. That's part of being an asset manager. We follow our clients' mandates.\n\nBut when it comes to energy, I also understand why people have different preferences in the first place. Decarbonization and energy security are the two macroeconomic trends driving the demand for more energy infrastructure. Sometimes they're competing trends. Other times, they're complementary, like when the same advanced battery that decarbonizes your grid can also reduce your dependence on foreign power.\n\nThe point is: The energy transition is not proceeding in a straight line. As I've written many times before, it's moving in different ways and at different paces in different parts of the world. At BlackRock, our job is to help our clients navigate the big shifts in the energy market no matter where they are.",

        "page_content": "of client assets, which grew by over $1.4 trillion in 2023.\n\nIn good times and bad, whether clients are focused on increasing or decreasing risk, our consistent industry-leading organic growth demonstrates that clients are consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock. In 2023, our clients awarded us with $289 billion in net new assets during a period of rapid change and significant portfolio de-risking.\n\nBlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to continue to grow with our clients and maintain positive organic base fee growth. We've grown regardless of the market backdrop and even as most of the industry experienced outflows.\n\nI think back to 2016 and 2018 when uncertainty and cautious sentiment impacted investment behavior among institutions and individuals. Many clients de-risked and moved to cash. BlackRock stayed connected with our clients. We stayed rigorous in driving investment performance, innovating new products and technologies, and providing advice on portfolio design. Once clients were ready to step back into the markets more actively, they did it with BlackRock - leading to new records for client flows, and organic base fee growth at or above our target.\n\nFlows and organic base fee growth accelerated into the end of 2023. We saw $96 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter and entered 2024 with great momentum.\n\nIn 2024, I plan to do what I did in 2023 - spend a lot of time on the road visiting clients. I've already taken several trips in the U.S. and around the world, and it's clearer than ever that companies and clients want to work with BlackRock.\n\nFor companies where we are investing on behalf of our clients, they appreciate that we typically\n\nprovide long-term, consistent capital. We often invest early, and we stay invested through cycles whether it's debt or equity, pre-IPO or post-IPO. Companies recognize BlackRock's global relationships, brand, and expertise across markets and industries. This makes us a valuable partner, and in turn supports the sourcing and performance we can provide for clients.\n\nOver the past 18 months, we've sourced and executed on a number of deals for clients. In addition to the STRATOS direct air capture project, our funds partnered with AT&T on the Gigapower JV to build out broadband in communities across the U.S. We also made investments globally, including in Brasol (Brazil), AirFirst (South Korea), Akaysha Energy (Australia), and the Lake Turkana Wind Farm (Kenya).\n\nOur ability to source deals for clients is a primary driver of demand for BlackRock private markets strategies. These strategies saw $14 billion of net inflows in 2023, driven by infrastructure and private credit. We continue to expect these categories to be our primary growth drivers within alternatives in the coming years.\n\nOur active investment insights, expertise and strong investment performance similarly differentiate BlackRock in the market. We saw nearly $60 billion of active net inflows in 2023, compared with industry outflows.\n\nIn ETFs, BlackRock generated an industry-leading $186 billion of net inflows in 2023. Our leadership in the ETF industry is another testament to our global platform and connectivity with clients.\n\nWhat we have seen in market after market is that if we can make investing easier and more affordable, we can quickly attract new clients. We are leveraging\n\nSource: S&P Global. The performance graph is not necessarily indicative of future investment performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour public and private markets franchises. And integrated technology will be needed to help clients be nimble while operating at scale.\n\nThese are the times where investors are making broad changes to the way they build portfolios. BlackRock is helping investors build the 'portfolio of the future' - one that integrates public and private markets and is digitally enabled. We view these changes as big catalysts. With the diversified investment and technology platform we've built, we've set ourselves up to be a structural grower in the years ahead.\n\n## Positioning our organization for the future\n\nJust as we continually innovate and evolve our business to stay ahead of our clients, we also evolve our organization and our leadership team.\n\nEarlier this year we announced changes to reimagine our business and transform our organization to better anticipate what clients need - and shape BlackRock so clients\n\ncan continue to get the insights, solutions, and outcomes they expect from us.\n\nFor years, BlackRock has worked with clients across the whole portfolio, albeit with distinctions between product structures for ETFs, active mutual funds, and separate accounts.\n\nNow the traditional lines between products are blurring. Clients are building portfolios that seamlessly combine both active and index strategies, including liquid and illiquid assets and spanning public and private markets, across ETF, mutual fund, and separate account structures.\n\nBlackRock has been critical in expanding the market for ETFs by making them accessible to more investors and delivering new asset classes (like bonds) and investment strategies (like active). As a result of that success, the ETF is no longer just an indexing concept - it is becoming an efficient structure for a range of investment solutions.\n\nWe always viewed ETFs as a technology, a technology that facilitated investing. And just as our Aladdin technology has become core to asset management, so too\n\nhave ETFs. That's why we believe embedding our ETF and Index expertise across the entire firm will accelerate the growth of iShares and every investment strategy at BlackRock.\n\nWe'll be nimbler and more closely aligned with clients through our new architecture with the aim of delivering a better experience, better performance, and better outcomes.\n\n## Voting choice\n\nHealthy capital markets depend on a continuous feedback loop between companies and their investors. For more than a decade, BlackRock endeavored to improve that feedback loop for our clients.\n\nWe've done it by building an industry-leading stewardship program, one that's focused on engaging investee companies on issues impacting our clients' long-term economic interests. This requires understanding how companies are positioned to navigate the risks and opportunities they face - for example, how geopolitical fragmentation might rewire their supply chains or how higher\n\ndigital wealth platforms in local markets to provide more investment access and accelerate organic growth for iShares ETFs.\n\nIn EMEA, BlackRock powers ETF savings plans for end investors, partnering with many banks and brokerage platforms, including Trade Republic, Scalable Capital, ING, Lloyds, and Nordnet. These partnerships will help millions of people access investments, invest for the long-term, and achieve financial well-being.\n\nIn 2023, we also announced our minority investment in Upvest, which will help drive innovation in how Europeans access markets and make it cheaper and simpler to start investing.\n\nThen there is our work with Britain's leading digital bank, Monzo, to offer its customers our products through its app, with minimum investments as low as \u00a31. Through these relationships, we're evolving our iShares ETF franchise to meaningfully increase access to global markets.\n\nLet me also say a few words about Aladdin. It remains the language of portfolios, uniting all of BlackRock, and providing the technological foundation for how we serve clients across our platform. And Aladdin isn't just the key technology that powers BlackRock; it also powers many of our clients. The need for integrated data and risk analytics as well as whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving annual contract value (ACV) growth.\n\nIn 2023, we generated $1.5 billion in technology services revenue. Clients are looking to grow and expand with Aladdin, reflected in strong harvesting activity, with over 50% of Aladdin sales being multi-product.\n\nAs we look ahead, the re-risking of client portfolios will create tremendous prospects for both",

        "page_content": "borrowing cost might impact their capacity to deliver sustained earnings growth.\n\nTo do that, we built one of the largest stewardship teams to engage with companies, often alongside our investment teams, because we never believed in the industry's reliance on the recommendations of a few proxy advisors. We knew our clients would expect us to make independent proxy voting decisions, informed by our ongoing dialogue with companies - a philosophy that continues to underpin our stewardship efforts today. For our clients who have entrusted us with this important responsibility, we remain steadfast in promoting sound corporate governance practices and financial resilience at investee companies on their behalf.\n\nAnd for our clients who wish to take a more direct role in the proxy voting process, we continue to innovate to provide them with more choice. In 2022, BlackRock was the first in our industry to launch Voting Choice, a capability that enabled institutional investors to participate in the proxy voting process. Today, about half of our clients' index equity assets under management can access Voting Choice. And in February, we launched a pilot in our largest core S&P 500 ETF, enabling Voting Choice for individual investors for the first time.\n\nWe welcome these additional voices to corporate governance and believe they can further strengthen shareholder democracy. I believe that more asset owners can participate in this important process effectively if they are well-informed. We are encouraged by their engagement and the continued transformation of the proxy voting ecosystem\n\nbut continue to believe that the industry would benefit from additional proxy advisors.\n\n## Strategy for long-term growth\n\nFor 36 years, BlackRock has led by listening to our clients and evolving to help them achieve long-term outcomes. That commitment has been behind everything we've done as a firm, whether it's unlocking new markets through iShares, pioneering whole portfolio advisory, launching Aladdin on the desktops of investors and so much more. Clients have been at the foundation of our mindset and our growth strategy, informing the investments we've made across our businesses.\n\nThe combination of technology and advisory, alongside ETFs, active and private markets capabilities, enables us to deliver a better client experience - leading to clients consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock or engaging us for outsourcing solutions. We believe this in turn will drive continued differentiated organic growth into the future.\n\nAs we do each year, our management team and Board spent time assessing our strategy for growth. We challenge ourselves to think: What opportunities will this economic environment create for BlackRock and our clients, what more can we do to meet and anticipate their needs? How can we evolve our organization, operating structure, investment capabilities, and service models and, in doing so, keep leading the industry?\n\nWe have strong conviction in our strategy and our ability to execute with scale and expense discipline. Our strategy remains centered on growing Aladdin, ETFs, and\n\nWe are honored that our clients entrusted us with $289 billion of net new assets in 2023. And over the past few months, we've seen a decidedly more positive sentiment and tone in markets and among clients that I'm very optimistic will carry into the rest of 2024.\n\nOur ability to adapt, evolve, and grow has generated a total return of 9,000% for our shareholders since our IPO in 1999. That is well in excess of the S&P 500 return of 490% and representative of a business model serving all our stakeholders.\n\n## Our Board of Directors\n\nBlackRock's Board plays an integral role in our strategy, our growth and our success.\n\nThe diverse experiences and backgrounds of our Directors enable us to have rich discussions and debates. At each meeting, our Directors review components of our long-term strategy and foster constructive dialogue with our leadership team on strategic opportunities, priorities and risks facing BlackRock's business. This dialogue ultimately pushes us to make the sometimes tactical and sometimes transformational moves to build a better BlackRock. This includes the two transformational moves we made in January: the strategic re-architecture of our organization and our agreement to acquire GIP.\n\nThese two transformational changes are the largest since our acquisition of Barclays Global Investors nearly 15 years ago.\n\nFollowing the closing of the GIP transaction, we plan to have Bayo Ogunlesi join our Board of\n\nDirectors. We will continue to evolve our Board over time to reflect the breadth of our global business and to guide us as we evolve ahead of our clients' needs.\n\n## A final note\n\nOver the past 36 years, BlackRock has grown from a company of eight people in a tiny Manhattan office into the largest asset manager in the world. But our growth is just a small part of a much larger success story.\n\nIt's part of the same story that includes my parents retiring comfortably after 50 years of hard work. The same story where America was able to endure the 1980s S&L crisis and 2008 financial crisis - and rebound quickly and with growing strength.\n\nAnd it's the story that, hopefully, will include more people around the world. Nations that can outgrow their debt. Cities that can afford to power more homes and build more roads. Workers who can live out their golden years with dignity.\n\nAll of these stories are only possible because of the power of the capital markets and the people who are hopeful enough to invest in them.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Laurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nprivate markets, keeping alpha at the heart of BlackRock, leading in sustainable investing, and advising clients on their whole portfolio.\n\nWe have continually made internal investments for organic growth and efficiency, investing ahead of client opportunities in private markets, ETFs, technology and whole portfolio solutions.\n\nIn private markets, we are prepared to capitalize on structural growth trends. Whether it's executing on demand for much-needed infrastructure, or the growing role of private credit as banks and public lenders move away from the middle market, private capital will be essential. BlackRock is poised to capture share through our scale, proprietary origination, and track record. And we believe our planned acquisition of GIP will meaningfully accelerate our ability to offer our private markets capabilities to our clients.\n\nIn ETFs, we will continue to lead by expanding investment access globally and through innovation. The ETF is an adaptable piece of financial technology, and over time we've been able to do more with it than just making investing more affordable. We've been able to bring better liquidity and price discovery to more opaque markets. One recent example is offering people exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs.\n\nETFs have been an incredible growth story in the U.S., with iShares leading the way. We believe global ETF adoption is set to accelerate as catalyst trends that we saw in the U.S. years ago like the growth of fee-based advisory and model portfolios are just beginning to take root. Nearly half of 2023 iShares net inflows were from our ETFs listed internationally in local markets, led by European iShares net inflows of $70 billion.\n\nActive asset allocation, security selection and risk management have consistently been key elements in long-term returns. Our active teams across multiasset, fixed income and equities are well-positioned to seize on broad opportunities arising out of this new interest rate and potentially more volatile regime. We are particularly excited about the opportunity in fixed income and how artificial intelligence is propelling performance in our systematic investing businesses.\n\nFixed income is going to be increasingly relevant in the construction of whole portfolios with higher yields and better return potential compared to the lowrate environment of the last 15 years. Now that the rate on 10-year U.S. Treasuries is near long-term averages, clients are reconsidering bond allocations.\n\nBlackRock is well-positioned with a diversified fixed income platform. It's not going to be just about index, where we manage nearly $1.7 trillion. Or just about active, where we manage over $1 trillion. Some of the most interesting portfolio conversations are with allocators who are blending ETFs with active or using innovations like our active ETFs for professionally managed income solutions.\n\nAcross asset classes, the need for integrated data, technology and risk management will continue to drive demand for Aladdin. Through its dynamic ecosystem of over 130,000 users, the Aladdin platform is constantly innovating and being improved. Investments in Aladdin AI copilots, enhancements in openness supporting ecosystem partnerships, and advancing whole portfolio solutions are going to further augment the value of Aladdin.",

The success of BlackRock's inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy in the timeframe BlackRock expects, or at all. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock's inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock or that overlap with existing BlackRock businesses. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock's control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial ('Circle'), which is associated with crypto asset markets which experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock's investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company's competitive assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and IP or other legal claims.

BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy in the timeframe BlackRock expects, or at all. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock's inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock or that overlap with existing BlackRock businesses. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock's control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial ('Circle'), which is associated with crypto asset markets which experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock's investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company's competitive position in the investment management industry.\n\nposition in the investment management industry.\n\n## BlackRock is subject to risks associated with its proposed acquisition of GIP, including completion of the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe and failure to BlackRock is subject to risks associated with its proposed acquisition of GIP, including completion of the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe and failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\n\nrealize anticipated benefits of the acquisition.

The benefits of cloud-based platforms are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategies; however these partnerships also introduce new risks, including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as BlackRock and the Aladdin platform continue to grow. Failures by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock's exchange-traded fund ('ETF') platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock's exchange-traded fund ('ETF') platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.\n\nvolatility.

As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power. Some commentators have argued that continued growth of index funds has the potential to impact stock market competitiveness by exacerbating stock price moves and market volatility. Some commentators, regulators and lawmakers have also argued that index managers have accumulated outsized influence through the proxy voting power their clients have assigned them. Some have proposed limitations on the ability of index fund managers to vote on behalf of their clients, or that voting and engagement on certain topics should trigger changes in regulatory status. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. In 2023, the FTC and DOJ released new merger guidelines recognizing that common ownership may reduce competitive incentives. Common ownership may be given greater consideration in regulatory investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and European Parliament reports in 2020 suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry in 2021 on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. In 2023, the UK Competition & Markets Authority ('CMA') established a new economic research unit which identified common ownership as a potential research topic. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including at the FTC and CMA, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power.

The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company's financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company's senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company's relative performance against industry peers.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to exclude compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company began hedging economically in 2023. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period.

(c) Lease costs - New York . In 2022 and 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company's move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters.

The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary ('PB') of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company's contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company's involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert absolute control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company's ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10%or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was deemed to be the PB of approximately 100 VIEs.

The Company performs its impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually, as of July 31st. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, the Company performs certain quantitative assessments and assesses various significant qualitative factors. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired, the fair value of the asset is then compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to revenue basis points, projected assets under The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of management contracts, trade names/trademarks and licenses acquired in business acquisitions.
