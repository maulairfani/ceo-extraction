This year has been nothing short of extraordinary for your company, and we are proud of the achievements it has accomplished.\n\nDuring FY24 Our market capitalization touched an all-time high of ' 3.49 lakh Crore ($42 billion). This surge in investor confidence is  a  testimony  to  the  company's  sound  financial  management and  belief  in  its  long-term  growth  prospects.  I  would  like  to congratulate you on this achievement and express my sincere thanks for reaffirming your trust in us.\n\nYour  company's  balance  sheet  has  been  growing  bigger  and stronger  demonstrating  its  financial  strength  and  stability. Consolidated PAT for FY24 stood at ' 21,332 Crore ($ 2.54 billion), registering an increase of nearly 25% over FY23. We have also realized over 100% of our current billing with a total realization of ' 1,57,138 Crore ($ 18.93 billion) and our debtors stand at only 31 days of average billing. These achievements could not have been possible without the consistent efforts of a dedicated team.\n\nFurthermore, as informed earlier, to solidify our commitment to clean energy, the Initial Public Offering of our subsidiary, NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) is on the anvil.\n\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to enhancing financial performance, delivering consistent returns for our shareholders, and  maintaining  our  reputation  as  a  trusted  and  responsible leader in the energy industry.  This commitment is reflected in the payment of dividend for the 31 st consecutive year with a declaration of a total dividend of ' 7.75 per equity share for FY24, subject to shareholders' approval in the upcoming Annual General Meeting. This dividend payout is nearly 42% of our profit. We are completely focused on increasing the wealth of shareholders and working on alternative ways of incentivizing the shareholders as well.\n\nOne of the important events in the past year has been the issuance of the Tariff Regulations by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission for the five-year period (2024-29) starting 1 st April 2024. These are forward-looking and capture the needs of the sector through various provisions. These tariff regulations are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpected  to  help  us  continue  our  growth  trajectory,  which  is essential for meeting the country's growing power needs.\n\nProviding  reliable  and  affordable  power  has  been,  and  will continue to be, our guiding principle as we define priorities for the future. We're continuously investing in and adapting to advanced technologies to meet the nation's growing electricity demand. Our team has been working relentlessly to deliver value in all facets of our business and our goal is to make decisions that will benefit the shareholders.\n\nDue to the strong focus on the 'Make-in-India' initiative of the Government coupled with changes in residential consumption patterns, it is expected that India will continue to register 6-7% annual growth in power demand at least for the next decade. This  mandates  the  requirement  of  additional  capacities  both renewable  and  conventional  sources  till  significant  storage capacity is in place. This offers enough room for power utilities like NTPC to expand their horizons. Accordingly, your company is fully geared up to tap this opportunity and take all required actions for expanding its portfolio with the right fuel mix.\n\nEnsuring  the  safety  of  our  operations  is  paramount.  We  are continuously  evaluating  to  enhance  our  safety  measures  to meet and exceed industry standards, reflecting our dedication to operational  excellence  and  responsible  stewardship  of shareholder  interests.  We  have  implemented  rigorous  safety protocols, devised training modules for imparting training to all the employees including contractual workers and investing in stateof-the-art technology to maintain a safe working environment.\n\n## Building a Brighter, Sustainable Future for India\n\nNTPC holds a commanding 17% share of India's total installed power  capacity.  When  it  comes  to  generation,  the  company contributes a substantial 24% of India's total power generation which  underscores  our  robust  O&M  and  asset  management practices.\n\nYour  company  achieved  generation  of  422  BU  of  electricity, registering a growth of ~6% year-on-year. We have also added 3924 MW capacity, taking the total installed capacity to 76 GW. The  addition  includes  not  just  coal-based  power  plants  but Renewable  energy  capacity  as  well.  This  impressive  growth",

As per the estimates prepared by the Central Electricity Authority, the peak demand is expected to touch 366 GW in 2032. Accordingly, the additional coal-based capacity requirement is 80 GW including 28 GW which is currently under construction. Out of the 80 GW, your company is expected to add 26 GW of coal-based capacity including  9.5  GW  which  is  under  construction,  and  all  these capacities are planned to be commissioned by 2031-32.\n\nAs part of the above plan, in FY24, orders have been placed for 3200 MW of coal-based capacity at Singrauli-III and LaraII. Further, tenders have been issued for 10.4 GW of capacity which is expected to be placed in 2024 and the orders for the balance capacity is also expected to be placed in next one year.

We are constantly evolving and developing new  strategies  and  business  models  for  fast-tracking  the renewable capacity addition. Our focus has been changed from implementing projects through a plain EPC model to sourcing components and aggregating which includes solar PV modules, land patches and connectivity. Your company's strong presence across the length and breadth of the country gives us an edge to collaborate with various State Governments for securing land patches and we are effectively utilising this position.\n\nWe are fast-tracking the development of hydro projects through your company's subsidiaries THDC and NEEPCO.

We consistently strive  to  align  our  operations  and  business  processes  to effectively meet the expectations of our esteemed stakeholders. Our strategies are meticulously crafted to prioritize the needs of our diverse range of stakeholders, encompassing employees, communities, contractors, customers, and vendors. We actively engage with them with unwavering commitment and undertake materiality  assessment  to  capture  and  integrate  stakeholder issues  into  our  decision-making  and  business  strategy.  We prioritize critical and recurring stakeholder concerns within the analysis, which further inform our actions and responses as outlined in the materiality section.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement 1\n\nWe,  at  NTPC,  recognize  that  stakeholder  engagement  is  a continuous  process,  encompassing  interactions  at  various management  levels  and  through  diverse  communication channels. With a rich history spanning nearly five decades, we have diligently cultivated a positive and constructive relationship with  our  stakeholders,  built  upon  the  foundations  of  mutual trust, transparency, ethics, and accountability. Our growth and achievements can be attributed in large part to the ongoing dialogue that we maintain with stakeholders, actively seeking and incorporating their valuable feedback on matters pertaining to our operations.\n\nTo  effectively  manage  stakeholder  relationships,  NTPC  has implemented  a  comprehensive  and  structured  stakeholder management process across verticals, functions, and establishments. This includes a 4 step systematic methodology that  includes  identifying  key  stakeholders,  analyzing  their perspectives and interests, and mapping and prioritizing their needs, leading ultimately to the framing of engagement strategy. Further  details  on  this  process  can  be  found  on  the  NTPC website  at  https://www.ntpc.co.in/sustainability/stakeholdermanagement.\n\nStakeholder engagement framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 GRI 2-29\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Stakeholders\n\n| Stakeholder   Group   |            | Modes of   Engagement                                                                                                                 | Frequency of  Engagement                                           | Key Concerns                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Materiality Topics  Linkage   |\n|-----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Government of India   | \u00b7  \u00b7       | Minister & Secretary  level review Meetings with MoP,  MNRE, MoEFCC, MoC,  DAE, DPE, Parliamentary  Committees, CEA, NITI  Aayog etc. | \u00b7  Quarterly \u00b7  Need based                                         | \u00b7  Ample power generation  capacity \u00b7  24x7 affordable power to all \u00b7  Maximizing infrastructure  utilization \u00b7  Social development \u00b7  Climate Change &  Environment conservation \u00b7  Promote Govt. schemes (viz. | All                           |\n| Regulators            | \u00b7          | Public hearings \u00b7  Statutory audits &  inspections  \u00b7  Meeting for clearances,                                                        | \u00b7  Need based  \u00b7  As per statutory  provisions                     | \u00b7  Optimum electricity tariff \u00b7  Compliance with changing  business environment                                                                                                                                  |                               |\n| Communities  & NGOs   | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7    | Public hearings  Village Development  Advisory Committee  (VDAC)  Public information  centers                                         | \u00b7  Need based  \u00b7  Annually \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                           | Infrastructure development  Quality of life  Employment opportunities  Land acquisition and R&R  issues  Increased community                                                                                     | 4, 6,7,8, 9, 12               |\n| Investors & Lenders   | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7    | Analyst and investors  meetings  Annual general meeting  Review meets with  bankers (Domestic and  Foreign)                           | \u00b7  Quarterly \u00b7  Annual \u00b7  Regular                                  | \u00b7  Improving Rol  \u00b7  Climate change & business  sustainability  \u00b7  Risk and governance  compliance  \u00b7  Increased disclosures on  Environment, Social and                                                         | 4,10,11                       |\n| Employees             | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7 | Participative forums  Communication  meetings  Employee surveys  Intranet and website                                                 | \u00b7  Defined  frequency of  concerned Fora  \u00b7  Need based \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7 | Professional growth  Work life balance  Health, safety and security  Timely resolution of  grievances                                                                                                            | 1,2, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have\n\nadopted  a  structured  methodology  for  conducting  materiality assessment using a dedicated materiality survey at a regular interval (3 to 4 years), in which we engage both internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Materiality Assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhase 1: Identify stakeholder & Potential material topic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhase 2: Material topic prioritization\n\n2 GRI 2-29\n\nPhase 3: Stakeholder engagement & materiality surveyPhase 4: Materiality survey Analysis & Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNTPC's Materiality Assessment Process\n\nPhase 5: Materiality Matrix Development & Reporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKeeping  in  line  with  our  robust  materiality  assessment methodology, we undertook an assessment of our material topics in FY-2021-22 (in accordance with the IIRC Framework and GRI standards) through a credible MNC. This exercise was helpful in prioritizing the inputs received from relevant stakeholders, as described  in  the  previous  section  (Stakeholder  Engagement), and  incorporating  them  into  the  decision-making  process  of NTPC.  The  material  topics  also  provide  further  insights  into\n\nthe challenges, risks, and opportunities that our company may face as described in the chapters on Risk and Governance, and Ethics and Vigilance. Our business sustainability depends on the effective management of material topics since it guides our strategic planning and management priorities towards creating long-term  sustainable  value  for  our  stakeholders.  The  details about  methodology  and  engagements  undertaken  can  be accessed from NTPC's website.\n\n(https://ntpc.co.in/sustainability/materiality-analysis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our  comprehensive  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA) studies are the cornerstone of our Environmental Management Plans, implemented across all our stations. Our environmental policy  emphasizes  the  efficient  use  of  natural  resources, waste reduction through recycling and reusing, the adoption of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncutting-edge technologies, and the enhancement of older units for  greater  efficiency  with  minimal  environmental  impact.  We continuously improve our environmental performance through practical engineering solutions and strict adherence to regulatory standards.  NTPC  stations 1 are  certified  with  ISO:  14001  for robust  environmental  management  systems  and  practices. Moreover,  we  have  established  an  environmental  grievance redressal mechanism to ensure the prompt resolution of issues and thorough documentation of all concerns and complaints.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water & Effluent Management 2\n\nNTPC acknowledges the essential role of water as a resource for life and remains committed to its sustainable management. Through vigilant monitoring, we aim to optimize water usage following the 3R principle: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Nearly all our thermal power plants utilize closed-cycle cooling systems with  cooling  towers  to  minimize  environmental  impact.  By adopting the latest technologies and maintaining regular upkeep, we  ensure  minimal  water  loss  primarily  due  to  evaporation, drift,  and  blowdown.  To  further  improve  water  efficiency,  we are increasing the cycles of concentration (COC) and reusing high-TDS blowdown water in other processes. Additionally, we have implemented zero liquid discharge (ZLD) across almost all stations, with exception of few stations where interconnecting infrastructure is being installed. Our current water discharges, including  treated  effluents  and  runoff,  adhere  to  established norms and conditions, ensuring no significant impact on water bodies or related habitats.\n\nOur efforts to enhance the reuse and recycling of effluents have\n\n- 1 List of certifications can be accessed from NTPC website.\n- 2 GRI 303-3 and GRI 303-4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuccessfully reduced the need for freshwater withdrawal over time. However, the increasing integration of variable renewable energy sources into the power grid is causing our thermal units to operate at lower plant load factors (PLFs), leading to higher per-unit  water  consumption.  The  installation  of  wet  flue  gas desulfurization (FGD) systems across all stations also poses challenges  in  reducing  water  consumption.  Despite  these challenges, our water conservation initiatives have enabled us to maintain specific water consumption at our thermal units below the prescribed norm of 3 liters/kWh.\n\nOur stations draw water from a variety of sources, including rivers, reservoirs, canals, and seawater for coastal plants. As most of our stations are equipped with closed-loop systems and ZLD, resulting in minimal water withdrawal and effluent discharge into water bodies, bio-diversity and ecosystems are duly protected.. In cases where non-ZLD plants are present, the discharge of treated effluent into natural watercourses strictly complies with regulatory standards.",

Central  to  these  efforts  is  our Rainwater  Harvesting  policy,  which  involves  constructing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally, NTPC has implemented an Ash Water Recirculation System (AWRS) to efficiently use both decanted ash slurry water and Toe drain water recirculation system for reusing seepage water from ash dyke. We have also adopted Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)  practices  across  our  stations  (with  exception  of  few stations) using a cascaded water usage approach to optimize water quality for various applications.\n\nEfficient  effluent  management  is  achieved  through  our  Liquid Waste  Treatment  Plant  (LWTP),  which  treats  liquid  waste from  various  plant  sources.  The  treated  effluent,  meeting specified standards, is used for operational needs such as coal handling, ash handling, and service water, promoting resource conservation. Any surplus treated effluent not utilized in non-ZLD plants is discharged responsibly, adhering to discharge standards and reinforcing our commitment to sustainable practices.\n\nWe  have  implemented  Sewage  Treatment  Plants  for  sewage effluent  treatment  and  reuse.  Effluent  quality  is  consistently monitored, and the treated wastewater is utilized for horticulture and other activities within the NTPC premises. In the reporting year, 99.94% of generated wastewater was effectively recycled, reducing the need for fresh water consumption.\n\n## Waste Management\n\nWe are committed to managing and disposing of all on-site waste in an eco-friendly, socially responsible, and economically viable manner.  Our  comprehensive  approach  encompasses  waste collection,  segregation,  transportation,  processing,  recycling, and disposal of various waste types. Our primary focus is on optimizing resource usage while minimizing waste generation. When disposal becomes inevitable, we strictly adhere to all rules and  regulatory  obligations  in  managing  hazardous  and  nonhazardous  waste  from  our  power  plants,  following  the  NTPC Waste Management Guideline.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our adherence to international standards and guidelines, such as the United Nations  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  10 (UN)  Global  Compact  Principles,  and  the  International  Labor Organization Core Conventions, serves as a foundation for ethical business practices. Respecting the rights of employees, including their freedom of association, is essential to fostering a positive work environment. NTPC recognizes the freedom of workmen (non-executive) employees to associate themselves with various unions, facilitating collective bargaining agreements. 5\n\n4 GRI 402-1\n\n6 GRI 408-1, GRI 409-1\n\n5 GRI 407-1\n\n7 GRI 402-1\n\nThere is no operational entity where manpower and suppliers face risk related to the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour and forced or compulsory labor. 6\n\nTo  ensure  smooth  transitions  during  significant  operational changes like location transfers, terminations, or resignations, a minimum notice period ranging from 4 to 12 weeks is required. 7\n\nCreating  a  safe  workplace,  particularly  for  women,  is  crucial for  maintaining  a  secure  and  inclusive  culture.  We  establish Internal  Complaints  Committees  at  operational  locations  to handle complaints of sexual harassment, promoting a proactive approach  to  addressing  and  preventing  such  issues.  These committees are reconstituted every three years, and resolutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare provided. During the reporting period, 4 cases of sexual harassment were reported and resolved with only one pending case as of now.\n\nEach NTPC project has its own Grievance Redressal Mechanism to address employee grievances promptly. We use various forums, such as communication meetings and organizational climate surveys, to capture and address these concerns. NTPC complies with statutory and regulatory requirements concerning payment of wages and benefits. We ensure that employees' rights are not violated and provide statutory benefits like Provident Fund and medical facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting Human Rights Awareness and Education\n\nAll employees and contractors are sensitized on Human Right related  topics  through  structured  training  programmes.  We\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprioritize transparency and address human rights  issues  for  external stakeholders, including Project  Affected  Families (PAF), through consultation and participation. Our policies specifically\n\nmention provisions for marginalized groups, ensuring comprehensive community development. We have established institutional mechanisms for grievance redressal, demonstrating our commitment to resolving stakeholder concerns in a timely and  fair  manner.  To  safeguard  human  rights,  all  significant investment  agreements  and  contracts  include  clauses  that minimize the risk of violations. We conduct regular monitoring to ensure compliance with regulations and internal policies. During the reporting year, no complaints regarding human rights issues such as child or forced labor at the workplace were reported.\n\n8 GRI 410-1\n\n## Enhancing Security Measures 8\n\nNTPC  places  utmost  importance  on  workplace  security  and maintains  a  safe  working  environment  across  all  its  station.

These agencies adhere to the norms established by the Directorate General of Resettlement, under the Ministry of Defence. These security personnel undergo rigorous training and refresher courses provided by the Government of India, encompassing security systems and human rights aspects.\n\nTo enhance security measures, NTPC is upgrading surveillance systems at all projects and stations by installing state-of-theart  security  systems.  The  introduction  of  the  Contract  Labor Information Management System (CLIMS), a biometric labour attendance  system,  improves  security  and  facilitates  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our PRMS (Post-Retirement Medical Facilities) Scheme, retired employees and their spouses receive access to medical facilities  in  company  hospitals  or  empaneled  hospitals.  As per the DPE (Department of Public Enterprises) guidelines, the company contributes up to 30% of Basic Pay plus DA (Dearness Allowance) as superannuation benefits towards Provident Fund (PF),  Gratuity,  Post-Retirement  Medical  Benefits,  and  Pension.

NTPC  collaborates  with  state governments on matters relevant to their jurisdiction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Demand-Side Management\n\nNTPC is not in the business of Power Distribution. Hence Demand Side Management does not directly pertain to NTPC. However, NTPC offers free seats for beneficiary DISCOMs to participate in Demand Side Management Programmes conducted at training centres of NTPC.\n\nSpecial Workshops at customer end are also conducted with eminent faculties to educate beneficiary DISCOMs in this area under Customer Relationship Management activity. To further strengthen customer relationship, NTPC sponsored 10 officials of beneficiaries / DISCOMs for the PGDM (Executive) program of the NTPC School of Business for the year 2023-24 as a capacity building initiative of power sector personnel equipping them with managerial and leadership skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer Data Privacy 1\n\nNTPC retrieves energy billing data from Monthly Regional Energy Accounts accessible through the RPC website.

Our focus is on reducing reliance on coal and gas by integrating renewable power.\n\nTo optimize resource utilization, surplus power not requisitioned needs redirection. The Commercial Function ensures this surplus power is available to other consumers through Power Exchanges or bilateral agreements. It is sold on both Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM) platforms.\n\n## Integrated Day Ahead Market (I-DAM)\n\nAny power not scheduled by DISCOMs is offered first in the Day Ahead Market (10:00 hrs - 11:00 hrs of the previous day).  Besides  selling  URS  power  based  on  DISCOMs' requests, power from merchant floating solar plants is sold in the I-DAM market. Relinquished power from gas stations is sold in the HP-DAM and bilateral markets. NTPC also sells regulated power from DISCOMs due to unpaid dues when opportunities arise.\n\n## Real Time Market (RTM)\n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  RTM  is  to  allow  generating stations to sell surplus power and DISCOMs to buy power for contingent needs. RTM operates through 48 half-hourly auctions  on  the  delivery  date,  enabling  price-sensitive bidding. Generators can sell URS power without beneficiary consent in the RTM\n\nNTPC has been participating in both the I-DAM and the RTM for selling any URS power in the Power Exchange through its trading arm NVVN. Besides selling the URS power, it has also been selling any regulated power, merchant power, relinquished gas power, infirm power in the Power Exchanges.
