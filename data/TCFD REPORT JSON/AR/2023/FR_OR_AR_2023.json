L'Or\u00e9al has once more significantly  strengthened  its  position  as  world  leader.  The Group  has  continued  to  demonstrate  the  excellence  of  its business model and its teams, whom I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  fundamentals  are  our  strength  and  our  difference: our  obsession  with  research,  innovation  and  quality;  a  dual commitment  to  business  and  society;  a  people-centered culture; listening to consumers; creating value that benefits all.\n\nAnother  inherent  asset  is  the  tremendous  quality  of  the executive team, whom I congratulate. Nicolas Hieronimus is a great captain, always improving the navigation of the L'Or\u00e9al ship and its focus on new horizons. I would like to pay tribute to his remarkable leadership in enabling the Executive Committee and all L'Or\u00e9al teams to harness tailwinds together.\n\nThe solidity  of  our  governance  and  shareholder  base  is  also key,  wholly  focused  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  long-term  interests.  The perfectly  complementary  roles  of  Chairman  and  CEO  are  a guarantee of the company's success and longevity. More than ever,  the  ability  to  rely  on  the  diverse  perspectives  and expertise of our Board members is crucial. Their insights help us  to  decipher  the  complexity  of  the  world  and  shape L'Or\u00e9al's  future.  This  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  paid particular attention to growth risks and opportunities in Asia and  emerging  markets,  along  with  the  progress  of  our sustainable and inclusive transformation programme, L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future.  It  also  considered  the  requirements  of  new European sustainability reporting standards.\n\nOur  commitments  and  values  are  equally  essential  drivers. Our  employees,  each  in  their  own  field,  have  further accelerated the implementation of positive-impact projects to rise to the challenges the world faces.\n\nAbove all,  I  want  to  highlight  the  extraordinary  commitment of  our  teams.  Once  again  this  year  they  have  surpassed themselves.  Their  entrepreneurial  spirit,  creativity  and  sense of ethics and responsibility will always be the lifeblood of our company.\n\nFor nearly 115 years, L'Or\u00e9al has actively built on stable pillars and an ability  to  adapt  with  phenomenal  speed  to  an  evershifting world.\n\nAs  a  result,  I  have  every  confidence  in  the  future  of  our company.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al gives hundreds of millions of people the freedom to be who they want to be and the power to feel good.\n\nThis  is  what  drives  us  to  pursue  this  exciting  and  inspiring Adventure in beauty.",

Thanks  to  their efforts  we  achieved  a  +11%  increase  in  sales  in  2023,  our strongest like-for-like growth in 20 years (excluding the postCovid rebound  in  2021), despite geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and a stagnating Chinese market.  We once  again  outperformed  the  extremely  dynamic  global beauty market (+8%) to reach more than \u20ac40 billion in annual sales  for  the  first  time,  with  a  record  operating  margin  of 19.8%. This remarkable performance is a clear vindication of the power of our multipolar model and operational agility. Our strategy  to  rebalance  our  regional  footprint  has  been another key to our success: it has allowed us to seize growth opportunities  wherever  they  arise  while  strengthening  our global  leadership  position.  I  am  particularly  pleased  with  the strong  acceleration  in  emerging  markets,  which  contributed 30% of our growth, together with the resilience of our historic markets in Europe and North America.\n\nStaying  true  to  our  dual  ambition  of  combining  financial performance with social and environmental performance, we continued  to  invest  in  targeted  initiatives  to  deliver  our L'Or\u00e9al for the Future commitments.  Our efforts have again earned  recognition  from  external  experts:    we  are  the  only company in the world to have been awarded a triple-A rating by CDP for eight years in a row.\n\nIn  2024,  the  global  market  promises  to  be  driven  by  the 'dopamine  effect (1) '  of  beauty,  which  attracts  consumers looking  for  wellbeing  and  pleasure  to  beauty  products.The infinite  opportunities  of  this  effect  provide  the  perfect backdrop  as  L'Or\u00e9al  celebrates  115  years  in  beauty.    Our company  will  continue  to  outperform  the  competition, drawing  on  our  proven  strengths:  our  scientific  excellence paired  with  boundless  creativity,  our  digital  leadership,  and our  unrivalled  portfolio  of  brands,  the  most  powerful  in  the beauty industry, able to serve consumers in all their diversity.\n\nI look  to  the  year  ahead  with  the  utmost  confidence, determined  to  pursue  our  transformation  and  invent  the future of beauty - a beauty that is increasingly personalised, inclusive,  sustainable  and  augmented  by  technology.  Thanks to our advances in artificial intelligence and the talent of our teams, we will continue to push the boundaries of creativity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWatch the full interview with the CEO by scanning this QR code or on lorealannualreport2023.com",

        "page_content": "L'Or\u00e9al's  Sense  of  Purpose (raison  d'\u00eatre) is  a  core  principle for  the  Group,  to  see  ourselves  as  a  high-performing, committed, responsible, inclusive company showing solidarity in  decades to come. L'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre is included in the strategic orientations defined by its Board of Directors and in its business model.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose was developed following the work implemented  over  almost  two  years,  initiated  and  driven  at the  highest  level  by  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  and  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus,  as  well  as  several  members  of  the  Executive Committee. L'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre was the result of dialogues with  the  Group's  employees  in  three  of  its  key  countries (France,  the  United  States  and  China)  and  many  external stakeholders, including consumers.  The  progress  made was  discussed  several  times  in  the  Executive  Committee. For  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  aim  was  to  collect  and  formalise  its contribution  to  the  world  as  a  company,  its  values  and  its commitments in one document.\n\nThis raison d'\u00eatre was approved on 6 February 2020 by the Board of Directors, who incorporated it into their Management  Report  published  in  the  2019  Universal Registration Document and presented to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 30 June 2020.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al was presented with the Award for ESG Purpose and Commitments  at  the  2022  General  Meeting  and  Gender Balance  Awards  ceremony,  organised  by  the Institut  du Capitalisme Responsable .\n\nA  single  sentence  epitomises  L'Or\u00e9al's  Sense  of  Purpose: 'Create  the  beauty  that  moves  the  world.' It  is  defined  in concrete  actions made  to  consumers,  employees,  clients, suppliers,  shareholders,  service  providers  and  communities. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to efforts to combat climate change, by respecting biodiversity and preserving natural resources, and to  championing  the  cause  of  women.  The  majority  of  the Group's  brands  have  supported  their  causes  since  2018, combatting  violence  against  women  with  the  Abuse  is  Not\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\nLove programme from Yves Saint Laurent Beauty, campaigning  against  street  harassment  with  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris and the Stand Up programme, helping women get access to reading  with  Lanc\u00f4me's  Write  her  Future  programme  or supporting  environmental  causes  with  Biotherm's  Water Lovers programme. In 2022, Biotherm launched an ambitious mission to use yacht races, including the Route du Rhum 2022 and  The  Ocean  Race  in  2023,  to  raise  public  awareness  of the  threats  affecting  the  oceans.  Furthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  has become  the  official  sponsor  of  the  Orient  Express  Racing team, the French contender in the 37 th America's Cup.\n\nIn its Management Report, disclosed in the present document, L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors reports on the implementation of the  commitments  included  in  its  raison  d'\u00eatre,  and  on  the progress towards the goals set:\n\n- \u00b7 economic performance is inseparable from corporate social responsibility performance. The results of the Group's nonfinancial  performance,  which  are  reviewed  by  external auditors  along  with  its  financial  performance,  reflect  the achievements of L'Or\u00e9al arising from its sense of purpose. Chapter 4 reports on the social, environmental and societal policies and progress, inclusion and ethics within the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme covering the Group's commitments to sustainability;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  also  presents  its  progress  and  achievements  in non-financial  areas  through  its  annual  reporting  made  to the United Nations Global Compact;\n- \u00b7 this chapter also reports on the Group's financial performance,  particularly  through  its  business  model (see section 1.3.); and\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  CSR  performance  is  one  of  the  factors considered  in  determining  the  variable  portion  of  the remuneration of L'Or\u00e9al's executive corporate officers (see section  2.4)  and  the  Group's  principal  executives  (see subsection 4.1.3).\n\n## 1.1.2. The strategy and fundamentals of L'Or\u00e9al\n\n## 1. A clear vision and strategy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has defined a clear vision that is broken down into two points:  its  Sense  of  Purpose  (raison  d'\u00eatre),  which  is  detailed above, and Beauty for eac L'Or\u00e9al aims to offer women and men  around  the  world  the  best  in  cosmetics  in  terms  of quality,  effectiveness,  safety,  sincerity  and  responsibility  in order  to  meet  all  their  needs  and  all  their  beauty  wishes  in their  infinite  diversity.  More  than  ever,  L'Or\u00e9al's  vision  takes on  its  full  meaning  and  represents  a  strong  anchor  in  this increasingly unpredictable and complex environment.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  is  to  combine  both  universalisation  and singularisation.  Universalisation  involves  the  globalisation  of brands by taking regional characteristics into consideration in order to serve and retain 1.5 billion consumers. Singularisation takes  into  account  a  growing  global  trend  towards  selfaffirmation for both men and women by providing a diverse range  of  offers  and  personalisation.  The  goal  is  to  offer inclusive  beauty  by  responding  to  the  specific  aspirations  of consumers  in  every  region  of  the  world.  In  contrast  to standardisation, it is based on careful attention to consumers and a deep respect for their differences.",

        "page_content": "The L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\n## 2. One single business: beauty, nothing but beauty and all beauty\n\nFor over a century, L'Or\u00e9al has carried out a single business: creating  beauty.  Cosmetics  are  rich  in  meaning.  They  allow each  person  to  boost  their  self-confidence,  express  their personality and open up to others.\n\nFocusing on a single business represents a major competitive advantage  for  L'Or\u00e9al  in  a  dynamic,  resilient  market.  The Group  boasts  more  than  one  hundred  years  of  cosmetic expertise,  talented  specialists  and  an  in-depth  knowledge  of consumers.  This  is  built  on  a  detailed  knowledge  of  beauty cultures,  needs,  desires  and  aspirations.  L'Or\u00e9al  covers  all continents  across  more  than  150  countries,  all  product categories (1) ,  all  distribution  channels  including  e-commerce and Travel Retail, and all price segments.\n\nBy  focusing  its  energy  on  a  single  business,  along  with  an obsession  for  'seizing  the  opportunities'  (' Saisir  ce  qui commence '),  L'Or\u00e9al is able to identify new consumer trends and  respond  rapidly.  The  digital  revolution  in  particular, in  perfect  alignment  with  'social  beauty',  connected  and shared,  acts  to  speed  up  the  development  of  the  beauty market  driven  by  economic,  technological,  demographic and sociological developments.\n\n## 3. The challenge of innovation: the strength of Research, Innovation (R&I) and Technology\n\nInnovation has been and remains the core of the L'Or\u00e9al  model:  the  Group  was  born  from  a  breakthrough innovation  -  safe  hair  dye  invented  by  its  founder  Eug\u00e8ne Schueller. L'Or\u00e9al believes that beauty happens when science and creativity come together to meet the needs of consumers who  expect  new  experiences  over  and  above  products  and services. The discoveries of R&I, as well as the unique intuition and  creativity  of  the  marketing  teams,  mean  that  products are  constantly  evolving  to  meet  consumers'  needs.  Because L'Or\u00e9al  records  a  significant  share  of  its  sales  with  new products every year, the Group has a duty to be the champion of cosmetics innovation.\n\nOn the one hand, the beauty of the future is now focused on Green  Sciences that  reconcile  efficiency,  naturalness  and sustainability  to  give  the  Group's  products,  formulas  or packaging a competitive advantage; and, on the other hand, on Beauty  Tech to enhance  science  via  cutting-edge technologies on a large scale and to offer unparalleled beauty experiences.  Innovation  is  at  the  heart  of  the  model  and, coupled  with  technology,  is  a  driving  force  for  growth  and discovery of new areas of beauty. Data, artificial intelligence, robotics  and  nanotechnologies  will  strengthen  and  speed  up the  Group's  innovations  to  help  make  it  a  champion  of  the Beauty  Tech.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  draws  on  some  of  the  biggest strategic  data partnerships,  most  notably  with  Verily,  the health  technology  arm  of  the  Alphabet  Group,  and  Bakar Labs,  the  University  of  California  Berkeley's  biotechnology incubator.  L'Or\u00e9al  invents  the  beauty  of  the  future  while becoming the company of the future.\n\n## 4. Marketing of brands, products, services and of the customer experience\n\nOver the next decade, the cosmetics market will become more digital  and  competitive,  with  the  arrival  of  new  players  from new markets and other industries such as fashion, luxury and e-commerce. In this context, L'Or\u00e9al's expertise and excellence in  creating  and  developing  major  brands  that  are prized by consumers all over the world will be essential assets. L'Or\u00e9al  has  always  been  able  to  create  star  products, from brand new franchise launches to innovations that evolve into 'icons' over time. The skills of the marketing departments for  our  brands  and  laboratories  are  key  assets  in  the collaborative,  agile  design  of  new  products,  services  and customer experiences.\n\n## 5. Adapting and seizing every opportunity through multi-polar growth in each region and division\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  global  footprint  enables  it  to  steer  its  growth  by continuously adapting to the context it faces, seize opportunities  as  they  arise  and  minimise  exposure  to  areas where  business  is  slower.  In  terms  of  regions,  Europe  has always been and remains the Group's core region as well as its historic  cradle.  North  America,  currently  the  premier  beauty market, is boosted by its demographics, the reinforcement of ethnic diversity and the ongoing acceleration of e-commerce. China  is  a  major  contributor  to  Group  sales,  with  its consumers representing a significant source of growth for the long term. A major accelerator for the Group is the emerging markets, including  the  Latin  America  Zone,  South-East  Asia, India and the Middle East. With a population of three billion; these  markets  are  young,  connected  and  hungry  for  beauty products. L'Or\u00e9al continues to expand in Africa.\n\nThe  Group's  four  divisions  enable  it  to  meet  all  consumer expectations. The Group's primary Division, Consumer Products, aims to give the best of beauty a more premium feel while  also  making  it  accessible  to  more  people,  and  it  is  the Group's  main  asset  as  it  attempts  to  conquer  the  emerging markets; the Luxe Division responds to the desire for quality and experience in the upper-middle classes; the Dermatological  Beauty  Division (2) responds  to  increasingly high  expectations  in  terms  of  skincare  and  sales  have  more than  doubled  in  just  three  years;  finally,  the  Professional Products Division  enhances  the  sophistication  of  the  market and the salon sector.",

Because there will be no economic growth without sustainability in the future, L'Or\u00e9al has set itself the dual goal of excellence, in both the economic and societal domains. It will be the condition for its success and its long-term existence. Because L'Or\u00e9al is the global  leader  in  beauty,  it  has  the  duty  to  contribute  to  the beauty  of  the  planet  and  be  a  champion  of  CSR.  And  it  is because  L'Or\u00e9al  is  a  social,  environmental,  societal  and  ethical leader that it will achieve greater performance in the future. The two performances go hand in hand and mutually enhance each other, as L'Or\u00e9al has demonstrated to date.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\n## 7. Prioritising people and social harmony\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  legacy  of  our  founder,  Eug\u00e8ne  Schueller, individuals and social harmony are at the heart of L'Or\u00e9al and must remain our priority in a climate where attracting talent is  becoming  increasingly  complex.  The  Group's  values  have always  been  humanist  in  nature.  In  entrepreneurial  culture, passionate  and  committed  teams  are  the  strategic  intangible assets that always have and always will make all the difference.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  human  and  social  project  constitutes  both  the strength  and  the  appeal  of  its  model  in  an  ever-changing world.  It  is  based  around  two  priorities:  the  attention  paid to  developing  each  employee  through  ongoing  learning, accelerated  career  paths  or  international  careers;  and  a unique social model  that  combines  competitive  social performance  and  shared  growth  (profit-sharing,  incentives, employee shareholding plan etc.).\n\nFor  more  than  15  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  and  recognised  for  its  actions worldwide. The Group's policy in this area is further developed in paragraph 4.3.2.6.\n\n## 1.1.3.

A balanced and committed Board of Directors, which fully plays its role of reflection and strategic impetus\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  defines  the  strategic  orientations  of L'Or\u00e9al and monitors its implementation, in accordance with its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social  and  environmental challenges of its business activity into consideration. It oversees the  management  of  both  the  financial  and  non-financial aspects,  and  ensures  the  quality  of  the  information  provided to shareholders and to the market.\n\nThe composition of L'Or\u00e9al's Board makes it possible to take into account the specific nature of its shareholding structure while  guaranteeing  the  interests  of  all  its  stakeholders.  At 31  December  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised 16 members:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairman, Mr Jean-Paul Agon;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus;\n- \u00b7 three  Directors  (one  of  whom  is  the  Board's  ViceChairman) from the Bettencourt Meyers family, which owns 34.73%  of  the  share  capital  -  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers;\n- \u00b7 seven independent Directors: Ms Sophie Bellon, Ms Fabienne Dulac, Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo, Ms Ilham Kadri, Ms Virginie Morgon, Mr  Patrice  Caine  and  Mr  Alexandre  Ricard.  50%  of  the Directors are therefore independent (seven out of 14 excluding the Directors representing the employees); and\n- \u00b7 two  Directors  representing  the  employees:  Mr  Thierry Hamel and Mr Benny de Vlieger.\n\nThe Board takes steps to ensure that the Directors come from different backgrounds  and  that  they  complement  one another  due  to  their  different  professional  experience,  their skills and their international exposure (see paragraph 2.2.1.2.) The diversity of skills and expertise on the Board enables it to understand rapidly and in detail the development challenges that L'Or\u00e9al faces.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  attentive  to  compliance  with  the  principle  of balanced  gender  representation  on  the  Board:  50%  of  its members are women (1) and two Board Committees out of four are chaired by women.\n\n- \u00b7 two Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) linked to Nestl\u00e9, which owns 20.13% of the share capital Mr Paul Bulcke and Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch;",

Ethics, at the heart of the Group's governance and commitments\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has built up its business on the basis of strong ethical principles  that  guide  its  development  and  contribute  to establishing  its  reputation:  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency.  These  principles  underpin  the  Group's  culture and business model and its compliance, responsible innovation,  CSR,  philanthropy,  Human  Rights,  and  diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitments to act ethically and responsibly are set out  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  Code  of  Ethics.  This  document,  available  in 30 languages and as an audiobook in French and English, is made  available to all employees worldwide. Country Managers  (or  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the  members  of the Executive Committee  to  whom  they  report)  are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code.\n\n## 1.2. The essentiality of beauty: supporting the growth of the beauty market\n\n## 1.2.1. The essentiality of beauty\n\nThe desire for beauty is a universal aspiration that transcends time, borders and cultures. Beyond appearances, beauty is a journey  that  shapes  our  identity,  individually  and  collectively. From  the  dawn  of  humanity  to  the  metaverse,  no  human culture has existed without cosmetics.\n\nBeauty regimes are an integral part of personal care and also play a role in social interaction. Personal hygiene rituals are a part of our lives from birth until death. All the major stages of life,  whether  individual  or  collective  celebrations  such  as birthdays,  weddings,  births  and  coming  of  age  ceremonies, with the first shave or application of makeup, are all marked by beauty rituals. Beauty is more than an individual quest; it is a social balm. It connects us to ourselves and to others.\n\nBeauty  and  health  are  intimately  related.  Nearly  two  billion people (1) suffer from skin problems. The beauty industry plays a  key  role  in  preventing  skin  conditions  such  as  melanoma (saving  $250  million  a  year  in  the  US  alone (2) ), and  in effectively  treating  other  skin  conditions  such  as  acne  and eczema,  which  can  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  well-being and mental health.\n\nBeauty gives us a sense of belonging to a community: there are conventions in beauty, makeup and clothing. It is a means of  integration,  but  also  of  expressing  difference.  Mastering the  language  of  beauty  is  a  social  asset.  Beauty  plays  an\n\nimportant  role  in  self-affirmation  and  identity:  it  builds confidence  and  enhances  well-being.  It  reflects  societal changes: it has always accompanied transformation, whether in terms of hair length or attitudes to makeup. It defies norms and stereotypes.\n\nFor several years now, we have been living in the era of 'social beauty',  connected  and  shared,  with  the  ubiquity  of  digital technology  and  social  networks  acting  as  a  formidable accelerator  for  the  beauty  market.  First,  because  the proliferation  of  tutorials  and  virtual  trials  is  facilitating  the adoption  and  correct  use  of  beauty  products.  Furthermore, because  buying  products  online  has  never  been  easier,  the growth  of  e-commerce  allows  us  to  reach  more  consumers, well  beyond  the  traditional  retail  sector.  E-commerce  now accounts  for  a  quarter  of  beauty  product  sales  worldwide, accelerated  by  the  Covid-19  crisis.  It  will  be  the  main distribution  channel  of  the  21 st century,  and  has  immense potential for development in many countries.\n\nFocused  on  consumers,  L'Or\u00e9al  acts  responsibly  throughout the  value  chain,  driven  by  excellence  and  technology  that enhances its innovation, production and logistics management capabilities.  New  solutions  are  being  developed  to  respond specifically to the new challenges of personalisation expected by consumers, and of flexibility and traceability.\n\n## 1.2.2. The beauty market, rapidly expanding in an ever turbulent macroeconomic environment\n\nImportant: the competitive positions and market shares held by the Group's Divisions and brands mentioned in this Document are based on studies, panels and polls obtained from specialised organisations and companies, or, in the absence of comprehensive studies, are the result of estimates made by L'Or\u00e9al on the basis of available statistical data.\n\nThe beauty market is set to continue growing, driven by the same economic, technological, demographic and sociological changes that have been taking place for several years, notably the rise of the middle and affluent classes (3) , and in particular the incredible appetite for beauty among younger generations on the Asian continent.",

        "page_content": "L'Or\u00e9al, a value-creating model\n\n## 1.3.4. A tailored, agile and responsive organisation\n\nThe  Group's  organisation  responds  to  a  dual  challenge:  pursuing  the  strategy  which  has enabled L'Or\u00e9al to be successful over the last 110 years and at the same time inventing the new L'Or\u00e9al of the future, perfectly matched to an ever-changing world.\n\nFrom an organisational and managerial perspective, L'Or\u00e9al is strategically centralised and operationally decentralised with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. This unique model empowers its in-country teams and guarantees flexibility and excellence on the  ground.  This  organisational  structure  is  perfectly  suited to  the  current  environment,  with  Zones  aligned  more  closely with consumers. During the 2020 crisis, it was a considerable asset in terms of putting in place measures that were tailored to the specific circumstances in each country.\n\nThe Group completed in 2021 the reorganisation of Zones it had  announced  in  November  2020,  aligning  them  more closely with consumers.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  is  a  French  company,  with  its  head  office  in France. It acts as a holding company and provides strategic coordination,  particularly  for  brands,  as  well  as  research, innovation  and  technical  coordination  for  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group throughout the world. At the same time, it performed a sales activity until this activity was subsidiarised on 1 July 2023 to the  companies  L'Or\u00e9al  France  and  L'Or\u00e9al  International Distribution,  as  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of 21 April 2023 in its 19 th and 20 th resolutions.\n\nThe  subsidiaries  operate  the  Group's  business  activities  in the  countries  or  region(s)  in  which  they  are  located,  on the  domestic  or  the  export  markets.  To  do  so,  they  define the  development  strategy  specific  to  their  market(s),  make the  most  suitable  choices  in  terms  of  consumer  targets  and distribution  channels,  and  manufacture,  directly  or  indirectly, and market the brands they decide to sell on their market(s).\n\nAlmost all of the subsidiaries are owned by L'Or\u00e9al S.A., which has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100% (1) . The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to the consolidated and parent company financial statements.\n\n## Operational Divisions\n\nThe  Group's  business  activities  are  organised  into  four Operational Divisions. In the markets, each of these Divisions develops  and  enhances  its  brand  portfolio  with  consumers (see below).\n\nBy  establishing  the  Group-wide  Travel  Retail  governance subsidiary,  the  Group  has  given  itself  the  resources  to  grow this  influential  segment  using  a  global  shopper  strategy:  a bespoke approach designed, at the destinations favoured by each nationality, to personalise the experience on the basis of the language, culture and beauty rituals of travellers.\n\n## Geographic zones\n\nThe  Group's  international  development  led  L'Or\u00e9al,  from 1  January  2021,  to  change  its  organisation  to  give  more coherence  to  each  Zone,  particularly  in  terms  of  consumer behaviour  and  market  maturity,  in  order  to  create  the conditions  for  a  cross-functional  transformation  of  the organisation and maximise growth.\n\nThe  geographic  zones,  each  of  which  has  operational responsibility  for  the  subsidiaries  in  their  market,  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Europe Zone;\n- \u00b7 North America Zone;\n- \u00b7 North  Asia  Zone  brings  together  mainland  China,  Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan region, Japan and South Korea;\n- \u00b7 SAPMENA - SSA Zone incorporates South Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa; and\n- \u00b7 Latin America Zone.\n\n## Functional Divisions\n\nSeveral specialist corporate  departments  provide  their expertise  and  support  to  the  Operational  Divisions,  to subsidiaries  in  their  markets  and  to  the  other  business activities (see subsection 1.3.2.).\n\n1",

Ongoing transformation to meet new aspirations\n\nWith \u20ac41.18 billion in net sales and more than 94,600 employees in 2023, L'Or\u00e9al is the worldwide leader in beauty.\n\nBecause the beauty market is a growing market with a focus on the future, the Group is, now more than ever, in a position to seize all opportunities, strengthen its leadership and ensure tomorrow's  success.  Building  on  a  long-term  vision,  with  a clear strategy, L'Or\u00e9al continues its development by relying on its  fundamental assets and transforming itself to respond to the  new  aspirations  of  consumers,  employees  and  society, to become the company of the future.\n\n## Transition towards a more sustainable operating model\n\nThrough  its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has set  itself  a  number  of  ambitious  targets  in  its  efforts  to combat climate change: in terms of reducing its CO2 emissions to  reach  100%  renewable  energy (1) for  its  operated  sites,  in terms  of  the  use  and  recycling  of  water  in  its  industrial processes and in terms of its product design (formulation and packaging) through bio-sourcing and the circular economy.\n\nOn  the  social  front,  L'Or\u00e9al  works  to  make  sure  that  its strategic  suppliers  pay  their  administrative  staff  a  decent living wage  and  adopts  policies  to  help  people  from disadvantaged  communities  to  access  employment.  The Group  has  also  committed,  on  the  one  hand,  to  supporting women in vulnerable situations with a charitable endowment fund of \u20ac50 million, and secondly, to investing \u20ac100 million in two investment funds dedicated to the circular economy and the regeneration of ecosystems, as well as \u20ac15 million via the L'Or\u00e9al Climate Emergency Fund to increase the resilience of vulnerable  communities  in  the  face  of  climate  disasters.  In 2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  co-founded  the  EcoBeautyScore  Consortium, with more than fifty players from the beauty sector, to set up a  scheme  to  indicate  the  environmental  impact  of  cosmetic products  so  that  consumers  can  make  more  sustainable choices.\n\n## Transformation of our formulation towards Green Sciences, to combine performance, safety and sustainability\n\nThe  transformation  of  our  formulations  towards  the  Green Sciences is at the heart of the beauty of the future. This new frontier of research, which combines biotechnology with new agronomic  and  cultivation  techniques,  is  making  it  possible for  L'Or\u00e9al  to  expand  its  portfolio  of  raw  materials  and to develop ingredients with a favourable environmental profile to  break  free  from  petrochemicals.  This  programme  aims  to minimise  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the cultivation  of  the  plants  these  ingredients  are  sourced  from, so  as  to  rely  on  eco-friendly  transformation  procedures. This  transition  will  provide  consumers  with  performance, safety and sustainability, and L'Or\u00e9al with a new competitive advantage. These aspects are set out in subsection 1.3.7.\n\n## Transformation to Beauty Tech to invent the beauty of the future\n\nTechnology  is  the  future  of  beauty  because  of  the phenomenal  breakthroughs  in  artificial  intelligence,  robotics, the Internet of Things, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology etc., which make it possible to expand L'Or\u00e9al's offering,  satisfy  all  consumer  expectations  and  offer  an experience that goes beyond products.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, which is already a digital-first company, decided to be the  pioneer,  champion  and  leader  of  Beauty  Tech  in  all  its areas  of  application.  By  building  up  state-of-the-art,  secure IT,  its  leadership in Beauty Tech and its expertise in artificial intelligence and data will enable L'Or\u00e9al to be a data-driven company  for  all  its  activities  and  functions.  The  ongoing transformation  of  Operations  towards  greater  agility  is integral to the Group's ambition to become a world leader in Beauty Tech.\n\nDigital  technology  is  fully  integrated  in  the  business,  in  all brands, jobs  and  countries.  It  is  based  on  a  solid  network  of over 5,900 digital experts, almost 67,500 trained employees and  a  wealth  of  in-house  know-how.  Digital  has  boosted L'Or\u00e9al's  strengths  tenfold  and  represents  a  booster  of opportunities  and  growth.  It  enhances  the  power  of  brands and  products,  enriches  the  connection  with  consumers  and creates experiences, new services and personalisation.\n\nE-commerce is an additional source of business, and a growth accelerator  because  it  means  we  can  reach  new  consumers wherever  there  is  no  existing  distribution  network.  The proportion  of  the  Group's  sales  represented  by  e-commerce multiplied by nearly six between 2015 and 2023 (5% to 27% (2) ), with  growth  in  all  Zones  and  Divisions.  L'Or\u00e9al  aims  to increase  its  e-commerce  business  to  reach  up  to  50%  of  its sales. This  means  strengthening  its  industrial  flexibility, adapting its supply chain in an 'omnichannel' approach and redesigning the downstream value chain immediately.\n\nBeauty Tech will ensure that beauty for all evolves into beauty for each. To achieve this, L'Or\u00e9al has a unique strength: being the  only  company  that  can  combine  more  than  110  years  of scientific  beauty  expertise  and  knowledge  of  our  consumers with cutting-edge digital excellence.\n\n## Transformation of work: reinventing the 'future of work' while strengthening the L'Or\u00e9al culture\n\nAll  across  the  globe,  the  working  world  has  undergone profound  changes  as  a  result  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis, particularly with remote working becoming more widespread, a  phenomenon  that  employees  now  want  in  their  everyday lives,  as  well  as  a  key  factor  in  the  appeal  of  an  employer. In  this  new  'hybrid'  working  environment,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  opted for  balanced  and  flexible  solutions  between  on-site  and remote  working  to  preserve  and  promote  opportunities  for exchange, cooperation and creativity. Since 2016, L'Or\u00e9al has rolled  out  the Simplicity programme,  renewed  in  early  2023 ( Simplicity 2 ), the aim of which is to transform ways of working to meet  new  expectations  on  the  part  of  employees (fulfilment, dialogue, cross-functionality) while adapting to the performance  requirements  of  a  constantly  changing  world and also enabling them to devote time to what matters most.",

Thanks  to  its  various  actions,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  eighth in the worldwide  ranking  of  most  attractive  employers  to  future business  school  graduates (1) . This  makes  the  Group  the highest-ranked European Union company.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, a value-creating model\n\n## Ongoing structural transformation to rationalise and identify synergies\n\nIn spring 2020, L'Or\u00e9al launched an initiative entitled NEXT to simplify its structures with a view to a post-Covid world. This work  involves  simplifying  the  organisation  by  creating  five internal  shared  service  centres  and  seven  geographic  areas, reviewing  the  brand  portfolio  of  each  Division  on  an  annual basis, and finally, simplifying the number of products in each brand's  catalogue  to  reduce  complex  manufacturing  and research.\n\n## 1.3.7. The mission of the Research department: responsible, inclusive innovation, in absolute safety\n\nThe  cosmetics  market  is  driven  by  supply  and  innovation. L'Or\u00e9al's  success  is  fed  by  its  permanent  obsession  for innovation, which feeds into its performance in all its forms.\n\nWith nearly 4,200 researchers and spending of approximately 3% of sales,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  the  top  R&I  force  in  the  cosmetics industry. This is a considerable asset, with a level of expertise and  a  wealth  of  unique  scientific  and  technical  data.  The performance, security and absolute safety of ingredients, the superior  quality  of  the  products  and  the  sincerity  of  their claims  are  the  fundamentals  that  inspire  the  Group's laboratory teams every day.\n\n## From upstream to downstream\n\nAdvanced  Research  teams  create,  develop  and  source  raw materials,  drawing  on  the  knowledge  of  skin  and  hair  from around  the  world.  The  Application  Domains  teams  develop formula architectures that improve the performance of active ingredients. The Development Laboratories create innovative formulas  with  a  proven  superiority  for  each  brand.  This innovation model is nurtured by a constant dialogue between the laboratories and marketing to respond to the expectations  of  consumers,  supporting  them  with  the  latest scientific and technological breakthroughs.\n\n## Research facilities around the world\n\nIn  order  to  adapt  to  consumer  expectations  worldwide, L'Or\u00e9al's  Research  teams  work  in  20  cosmetics  research centres and 13 assessment centres. The research centres are grouped  into  three  global  centres  in  France  and  6  regional hubs (2) that  identify  consumer  needs  and  study  their  beauty regimes. R&I teams build on this rich seam of local scientific ecosystems to develop collaboration agreements and partnerships  of  excellence.  The  data  generated  enables researchers to develop new beauty products or experiences, that are in tune with market needs and local expectations.\n\nR&I: A VAST ECOSYSTEM OPEN TO THE WORLD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

They have completely  revolutionised  the  way  we  understand  and  do science, which focuses on three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 sustainable  cultivation  to  reinvent  the  way  in  which  the Group  grows  its  raw  materials.  By  applying  these responsible  agricultural techniques,  L'Or\u00e9al  hopes  to preserve  water  resources,  contribute  to  soil  health  and strengthen  biodiversity  while  limiting  greenhouse  gas emissions and respecting populations and their ecosystems;\n- \u00b7 green transformation such as biotechnology, Green Extraction and Green Chemistry, to extract and transform raw  materials  to  obtain  the  ingredients  required  for formulations; and\n- \u00b7 formulation sciences, which, by combining ingredients from Green  Sciences,  enable  us  to  offer  responsible  and sustainable  products  to  consumers,  while  complying  with our safety and performance requirements.\n\n## 'Sustainable' partnerships\n\nThe R&I teams worldwide are bringing about a new scientific revolution  in  cosmetics,  based  on  the  principle  of  combining science, nature and technology.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is increasing the scientific and technological expertise of  its  4,000  researchers  by  developing  an  ecosystem  at  the cutting  edge  of  biotechnology.  Biotechnology  makes  it possible  to  cultivate  microorganisms  or  plant  cells  to  obtain more sustainable ingredients and to create new materials and innovative  solutions  derived  from  nature.  This  openness  to research  has  led  to  the  creation  of  a  unique  and  varied ecosystem with select partners:\n\n- \u00b7 US start-up Debut's advanced biomanufacturing platform is based  on  a  cell-free  approach  and  aims  to  bypass  the limitations  of  traditional  fermentation  and  directly  control biological  processes  for  the  manufacture  of  complex  natural products;",

It  is  the  first  start-up  to  have  been  selected  by 'L'Or\u00e9al Green Sciences Incubator @Genopole' at the French biotech cluster Genopole.\n\n## Innovation at the heart of the business model\n\n## AirLight Pro, a revolutionary hair dryer that is kind to hair and the planet\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  partnered  with  Zuvi,  a  start-up  established  by renowned scientists and engineers, to develop and manufacture  a  next-generation  hair  dryer  that  breaks  new ground by caring for the planet as well as hair. AirLight Pro uses a combination of infrared-light technology and wind. This makes  hair  visibly  smoother  and  more  hydrated,  while  also drying  more  quickly  thanks  to  optimised  heat  flow,  saving  a considerable  amount  of  energy.  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  will launch AirLight Pro in 2024 on select markets, including the United States and Europe, targeting beauty professionals and consumers  alike.  This  technology  received  a  CES  2024 Innovation Award (1) .\n\n## The Melasyl revolution: innovating to treat localised skin hyperpigmentation\n\nPigmentation  disorders  affect  a  large  proportion  of  the world's population, whatever their natural skin colour. L'Or\u00e9al has been studying pigmentation for over 35 years: numerous studies  have  been  carried  out  in  vitro  and  then  in  vivo  in humans  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  different  active ingredients: more than 120 clinical trials have been carried out over  35  years  in  13  countries/five  continents,  involving  more than 12,000 participants. In addition, in a recent AI-powered study, our researchers characterised skin ageing in more than 600,000  women  of  European  and  Asian  origin,  showing differences in the appearance of localised hyperpigmentation with age.\n\nThis extensive expertise in skin pigmentation in all its diversity has  enabled  L'Or\u00e9al  to  develop  Melasyl,  a  new  patented cosmetic active ingredient capable of regulating hyperpigmentation disorders and dyschromia and promoting a  more  even  complexion.  It  is  the  first  molecule  to  act  on localised  excesses  of  melanin  by  capturing  its  precursors, molecules with little colour, before they are transformed into eumelanin or pheomelanin, highly coloured pigments liable to accumulate excessively in the skin.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al acquires precision probiotics leader Lactobio to consolidate its microbiome market leadership\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Copenhagen-based  Lactobio,  a  company at the forefront of probiotics and microbiome research, builds on  20  years  of  advanced  research  into  the  microbiome  and will  give  L'Or\u00e9al  an  even  greater  understanding  of  these microorganisms that live on the surface of the skin. L'Or\u00e9al's microbiome expertise, together with Lactobio's significant IP portfolio, will enable the development of a new generation of safe, effective, market-leading cosmetics using live bacteria.\n\n## Inclusivity at each stage of L'Or\u00e9al's innovation model\n\n## Enhancing the inclusivity of beauty experiences with a more thorough knowledge of consumers in their infinite diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al aims to offer the best in beauty for all skin and hair types,  all  genders,  all  identities,  cultures,  age  groups,  beauty regimes and all lifestyles. Research places learning about skin and hair from around the world at the heart of its innovation strategy, so as to better understand consumers in their infinite diversity.\n\nIn  this  way,  we  can  identify  the  technical  and  emotional drivers connected with the expectations and specific needs of each consumer, better anticipate the technological and digital issues  of  the  beauty  of  the  future  and  evaluate  the effectiveness of beauty routines in the most appropriate and inclusive way possible.\n\n## The largest ever study of women's hair and skin\n\n' My Skin & Hair Journey ' (2) is the name of the multi-year study launched  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  Verily,  a  worldwide  leader  in precision healthcare technology. Researchers will get a better understanding  of  the  biological,  clinical  and  environmental factors that contribute to skin and hair health over time. This unprecedented  study  is  part  of  the  Group's  research  into longevity and the exposome. It is being carried out on several thousand American women (aged 18 to 70) from a wide range of ethnic and social backgrounds, and with different skin and hair  types.  By  collecting  the  first  ever  data  on  skincare  and haircare  perceptions  and  experiences,  the  study  will  shine  a light on how lifestyle, the environment, well-being and routines can affect everyone's beauty.\n\nThe information gleaned from this survey will give L'Or\u00e9al the chance to create and provide ultra-personalised skincare and healthcare products and services.",

Today, none of the Group's products or ingredients are tested on animals by L'Or\u00e9al. L'Or\u00e9al definitively stopped the  safety  testing  of  its  products  on  animals  in  1989.  The Group believes that there are other effective ways of ensuring that cosmetic products are safe. Over 40 years ago, L'Or\u00e9al was the first company to develop reconstructed skin, which is a  more  accurate  way  to  test  the  effects  of  ingredients  and cosmetic  products  on  human  skin  than  any  other  method; this  is  currently  the  case  in  the  laboratories  of  L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiary, Episkin, in France, China and Brazil. It is available to  governments,  organisations  and  other  companies  so  they do not have to resort to animal testing.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al contributed to the approval of dozens of alternative methods  of  testing  the  safety  of  its  products  and  has  also been  active  in  advocating  for  alternative  methods  in  China. L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  working  with  the  Chinese  authorities  for over  10  years  on  introducing  methods  that  are  free  from animal  testing  for  all  cosmetic  products.  Over  the  last  few years,  China  abolished  the  requirement  to  carry  out  animal testing  that  applies  to  most  cosmetics  sold  in  the  country. Since 2014, the Chinese authorities no longer test non-functional cosmetics (such as shampoo or make-up) that are  manufactured  locally.  Since  2021,  these  same  cosmetics imported into China no longer need to be tested on animals, subject to a certificate of compliance with manufacturing best practices.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is committed to cosmetics free from animal testing, by supporting scientific programmes to develop new alternative methods.  This  commitment  is  reflected,  for  example,  in international  collaboration  and  educational  programmes  to promote acceptance of these methods by the authorities:\n\n- \u00b7 in  February  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  co-founded  the  ICCS (1) ,  a  notfor-profit  organisation  with  40  members  to  promote cosmetics  safety  assessment  without  animal  testing, through research, education and regulatory engagement;\n- \u00b7 in  March  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  AFSA  Collaboration (2) worked  together  on  Master  Classes  dedicated  to  nonanimal testing methods. This free online learning programme is designed to help a range of players gain a better  understanding  of  predictive  approaches  without animal testing;\n- \u00b7 in  June  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  established  a  partnership  with  UC Berkeley's Bakar Labs, offering start-ups in this ecosystem access to its exclusive skintech platform. L'Or\u00e9al is offering access  to  its  unique  3D  reconstructed  skin  models,  an innovative  tool  for  assessing  the  safety  and  efficacy  of products, without the need for animal testing; and\n- \u00b7 in  August  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  R&I  and  Episkin  took  part  in  the 12 th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life  Sciences  to  present  their  commitments  and  progress. L'Or\u00e9al  R&I  has  supported  this  congress  since  2005, promoting science for cosmetics without animal testing.\n\n## Transparency: a key challenge in recent years and for the future\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to strengthen its commitment to transparency  in  order  to  meet  growing  consumer  demand for information about the composition of products. Launched in  2019,  the  'Inside  our  Products'  website  is  available  in 45  countries  and  in  eight  languages,  and  references  more than 1,300 ingredients. This content is gradually being added to  the  websites  of  the  Group's  major  brands.  At  the  same time,  the  expansion  of  the Product  Impact  Labelling (PIL) system provides consumers with information on the environmental impact of certain products (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2 B/). The latest transparency initiative is  the InFragrance scheme:  based  on  an  analysis  of  20,000 perfume formulas and thanks to the collaboration of our main fragrance suppliers (Firmenich, Givaudan, IFF and Mane), this approach  allows  consumers  to  understand  the  natural  or synthetic  origin  of  ingredients,  their  olfactory  properties  and the way in which they are combined to create the fragrance of  products.  As  a  responsible  leader  in  the  beauty  industry, L'Or\u00e9al would like this model to be open to other players in the sector,  both  manufacturers  and  retailers,  so  as  to  provide more transparency to consumers.\n\n## 1.3.8. The Operations team: a key driver of the Group's growth\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Operations Division creates innovative, inclusive and sustainable  beauty  in  collaboration  with  its  partners.  They harness  the  power  of  technology  and  strive  for  excellence to design, develop, supply, produce and distribute products and services worldwide. Consumers are at the heart of the decisions made by the Operations Division, which seeks the most agile and effective  solutions,  and  guarantees  compliance  with  strict standards of quality, safety and CSR worldwide.\n\n## Expertise and responsiveness to drive growth\n\nBuilding  on  years  of  operational  excellence,  the  expertise  and commitment  of  the  Operations  teams  have  boosted  the Group's  growth.  In  a  challenging  global  context,  they  have demonstrated their responsiveness and resilience, while pursuing their digital, sustainable and innovative transformation. L'Or\u00e9al's industrial  activities  are  at  the  cutting  edge  of  technology, Industry  4.0,  which  contributes  to  greater  agility  throughout the value chain to meet market challenges.\n\nThanks  to  science  and  technology,  the  Operations  Division can be innovative and is able provide a specific  response  to the new challenges expected by consumer for personalisation, agility and traceability, on the one hand, and to the employee experience  on  the  other,  such  as  simplification,  ergonomics and real-time access to information.",

Over  several  decades,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  single, global and structured quality and safety management system that  applies  to  all  its  plants  and  subsidiaries  worldwide. Detailed information is provided in subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2. A/.\n\nThis unique system guarantees manufacturing excellence and the products' quality with the same high standards applicable everywhere  in  the  world.  The  ongoing  quality  improvement process  has  been  effective  as  seen  in  the  low  rate  of consumer  complaints  in  2023:  69  complaints  per  million products sold (1) .\n\nEmployee safety is central to the L'Or\u00e9al model: in 2023, the Safety  Management  System,  which  applies  to  the  Group's teams  and  all  administrative  sites,  laboratories,  plants, distribution  centres  and  shops,  was  again  recognised  by RoSPA (2) .\n\nBy 2030,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof plastics used in the packaging of L'Or\u00e9al products will be recycled or biobased.\n\nBy 2030, L'Or\u00e9al will reduce by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe intensity of the packaging quantity used for its products compared to 2019.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, a value-creating model\n\n## At the centre of design and development is innovation in responsible packaging\n\nThanks  to  the  science  of  materials  and  design,  consumer experience  and  product  performance,  packaging  is  a  key differentiating  factor  for  the  product  and  therefore  of  its perceived value creation for the consumer. The L'Or\u00e9al teams, distributed  over  five  Packaging  Hubs  around  the  world, specialise  in  design,  consumer  experience,  innovation  and product development. They  rely on the expertise of laboratories dedicated to materials and packaging to create cutting-edge innovations worldwide. L'Or\u00e9al filed 55 patents for packaging in 2023.\n\nSince 2007, L'Or\u00e9al has adopted an eco-design process for its packaging. This  approach  is  based  on  three  key  drivers  (the '3 Rs'): Reduce packaging volumes and therefore resource use; Replace  materials  and  processes  with  others  that  have  a better  environmental  footprint  (renewable,  post-consumer recycled,  lower  carbon  impact  processes);  and  Recycle  by creating packaging that contributes to the circular economy.\n\nAt the end of 2023,\n\nIn 2023,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof new or updated products have an improved environmental profile*.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Basis of calculation representing 69% of all projects, excluding items considered to be irrelevant, such as ad hoc animation and promotion products and regulatory compliance leading to changes that are not visible to consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  for  participating  in  the  circular  economy received acclaim in 2023, with the Solar Impulse Foundation (3) recognising  L'Or\u00e9al's  adoption  from  2021  of  the  groundbreaking  innovation  from  Carbios,  which  has  led  to  the creation  of  the  first  cosmetic  bottle  made  entirely  from enzymatically recycled plastic.\n\nDetailed information is provided in subparagraph 4.3.1.1.6.\n\n## A purchasing programme that combines economic, environmental and social value\n\nTo accompany the Group's growth, the Purchasing Department  selects  the  most  economically,  environmentally and socially effective suppliers in accordance with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care responsible purchasing policy. Supplier performance is monitored thanks to precise indicators relating to social, environmental and ethical criteria and through their ability  to  innovate  and  to  meet  the  Group's  requirements  in terms of quality, agility, service and competitiveness.\n\n(1)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al builds solid relationships with its suppliers to ensure its responsible sourcing and to guarantee the flexibility, reliability and traceability of its supply streams. In a climate of tension and volatility, these long-term supplier relationships play a key role in the Group's ability to secure the volume and price of its raw materials supplies. 1,242 audits were carried out in 2023, meaning 4,891 since 2020.\n\nFrom 2010, L'Or\u00e9al chose to engage with suppliers that have an  inclusive  solidarity  model  in  order  to  provide  access  to employment  for  people  from  economically  or  socially disadvantaged communities, such as people with a disability,  the  long-term  unemployed  or  fair-trade  suppliers (see  paragraph  4.3.3.6.).  At  the  end  of  2023,  more  than 93,000  people  had  been  able  to  access  employment  via L'Or\u00e9al's worldwide Inclusive Sourcing programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the PET plastic used came from recycled sources.\n\n1",

This  network,  which  uses  the most  advanced  technologies  -  robotisation,  automation, cobotics  (collaborative  robotics)  -  is  constantly  evolving  to accommodate  the  growth  of  the  Group,  incorporate acquisitions, embrace external innovations and adapt to rapid changes in the beauty market. It is supported by a network of subcontracting  partners  to  deal  with  cyclical  peaks  in demand.\n\nThe  Group's  manufacturing  organisation  is  also  based  on specialisation by technology (1) to maximise best practices, increase agility, improve productivity and to optimise investments.\n\nWith  the  aim  of  supporting  the  growth  of  the  fragrance industry,  investments have been made to bring together the Group's expertise in the 'Manufacture du Parfum', represented by two dedicated plants in France. The Aulnaysous-Bois plant in the Paris region has been transformed to manufacture  the  fragrances  of  the  Luxe  Division  and complement  the  activities  of  the  Gauchy  plant  (Aisne), dedicated to best-sellers and mass production. This 'Manufacture' is a prime example of L'Or\u00e9al's responsiveness, its expertise  in  'French-style  luxury'  and  the  territorial connection of its manufacturing base.\n\nThe Operations Division also coordinated the overhaul of its skincare  manufacturing  capacity  worldwide,  with  major projects in the United States, North Asia and Europe (France), in response to strong growth in this category.\n\nMANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT BY GEOGRAPHIC ZONE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's Operational Excellence System, deployed in all its plants, is based on the commitment of all Operations employees to guarantee safety, health, quality, product availability, service levels, productivity, ergonomics and environmental impact.",

L'Or\u00e9al is thus the only company  in  the  world,  out  of  more  than  21,000  companies assessed,  to  receive  a  triple  'A'  ranking  for  the  eighth consecutive year, for its commitment and results in the three key areas: addressing climate change, protecting forests and ensuring water security.\n\n## A responsible, omnichannel supply chain strategy\n\nThe  Group's  Supply  Chain  Department  organises  and optimises the delivery of every one of the over 7 billion L'Or\u00e9al products to all customers, as well as directly to consumers. It is responsible for making sure that the products are delivered under optimum conditions, at the right time and at the best cost.  The  Supply  Chain  Department  and  its  distribution centres were particularly strategic and responsive in 2023 in order  to  support  L'Or\u00e9al's  growth  in  an  extremely  volatile market.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  unique  features  in  a  global  market  are  its  diverse range  of  distribution  channels  and  its  portfolio  of  many different cosmetic  beauty  products  categories.  L'Or\u00e9al continuously optimises all information flows and physical flows from suppliers to customers.\n\nThe  goal  is  to  increase  responsiveness  to  handle  market variations on all distribution channels and to adapt to market expectations  in  real  time.  Digitalisation  of  the  supply  chain and data management are critical challenges, and represent a real opportunity, especially in the retail sector and in stores managed directly by L'Or\u00e9al. It can provide a comprehensive view of business in a store, as well as improve understanding of the consumer purchase journey.\n\nThe supply chain network composed of over 150 distribution centres is a strategic lever to ensure agile coverage of market challenges  and  expand  our  service  offer.  To  create  a  more responsive supply chain, L'Or\u00e9al is investing in its distribution centres  to  gradually  transform  its  fulfilment  centres (4) : powered  by  automation  and  data,  they  manage  a  range  of services to consumers such as personalisation, box preparation and tailor-made delivery. They facilitate inventory interoperability  for  omnichannel  management  and  allow enhanced  product  traceability.  In  Suzhou  in  China,  for example,  L'Or\u00e9al  began  constructing  a  fulfilment  centre  to enhance  its  offering  of  personalised  beauty  services  and experiences.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  its  environmental  footprint,  L'Or\u00e9al  is co-creating  with  carriers  low-carbon  multimodal  solutions adapted  to  the  specific  features  of  each  geographic  zone (green delivery, reduced air freight, hydrogen engines etc.).\n\nIn 2023, the Group inaugurated the new Vennecy distribution centre in France for Consumer Products. Exemplary in terms of environmental performance (enhanced insulation, optimised mix of natural/LED lighting, passive air conditioning, roof-top photovoltaic power system and biomass-boilers),  this  centre  uses  data  and  automation  to optimise  flows  and  accentuate  its  ability  to  adapt  to  the markets.\n\n## Global economic performance at the service of the brands and the commercial entities\n\nIn  a  climate  of  short  and  long-terms  global  tension,  the Operations Division  plays  a  key  economic  role  for  all  brands and  markets,  which  has  an  impact  on  the  overall  cost  of products and their distribution.\n\nEconomic  optimisation  efforts  led  by  Operations  involve tracking the total landed cost, i.e. the final full cost of a product, which  includes  the  cost  of  packaging  and  raw  materials,  the value added by the plants and all supply chain costs.",

Their creativity, entrepreneurship and passion enabled us to report a third consecutive  year  of  double-digit  like-for-like  growth,  once again  outperforming  a  dynamic  beauty  market.  We  set  a new  operating  margin  record  and  delivered  +7.3%  EPS (1) growth.  In  a  challenging  environment  of  geopolitical tensions,  inflationary  pressures,  and  a  stagnating  beauty market in China, we delivered our best like-for-like growth in more  than  20  years  (excluding  2021).  This  is  a  clear vindication of the power of our multi-polar model, and I am particularly pleased with the strong acceleration in emerging markets.\n\n## 1.4.1.1.

This was driven by the ongoing success of K\u00e9rastase ,  especially its key Genesis and Chronologiste brand  franchises,  as  consumers continued to premiumise their haircare routines. Growth was underpinned by L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel 's breakthrough innovations,  including Metal  Detox and Absolut  Repair Molecular .  In  hair  colour,  it  was  driven  by  the  blockbusters Shades  EQ by Redken and  the  new Inoa by L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel .\n\nMomentum was positive across all regions, led by China, the Division's second largest market, as well as emerging markets, notably India, now the fifth largest market.\n\nIn  the  professional  beauty  industry,  the  Division  further strengthened  its leadership position, supported  by  its unrivalled Beauty Tech backbone, which drove strong growth in e-commerce both in B2B and B2C.\n\n## Consumer products\n\nThe Consumer Products Division had its best growth in more than 30 years at +12.6% like-for-like and +8.2% reported.\n\nThe  Division  outperformed  a  dynamic  mass  market  and delivered  strong  growth  surpassing  \u20ac15  billion.  Throughout the  year,  growth  was  driven  by  volume  and  value  as  the Division  continued  to  pursue  its  strategy  of  simultaneously democratising and premiumising.\n\nAll  four  key  brands  grew  in  double  digits,  with L'Or\u00e9al  Paris crossing the \u20ac7 billion mark.\n\nAll  major  categories  posted  strong  growth,  as  disruptive innovations  met  flawless  execution.  Makeup  was  the  leading contributor to the Division's growth, propelled by the launches of Surreal  Mascara by Maybelline New York, Infallible Matte Resistance lipstick by L'Or\u00e9al Paris , and Fat Oil gloss by NYX Professional  Makeup .  Hair  was  also  very  dynamic,  valorising with  premium  launches  like Elvive  Bond  Repair by L'Or\u00e9al Paris and Garnier Good haircolor . Skincare grew significantly, with the very successful global roll out of Garnier Fast Bright with Vitamin C as well the launches of Revitalift Clinical and Glycolic Bright by L'Or\u00e9al Paris .\n\nBy region, the most noteworthy performances were in Europe, where  momentum  saw  a  truly  spectacular  acceleration, making it a key growth contributor, and in emerging markets, particularly Mexico, Brazil, and India. North America delivered robust growth.",

This  was  driven  by continued  investment  in  its  portfolio  of  complementary brands,  as  well  as  its  ambitious  omni-channel  strategy,  now including  Amazon  in  the  US.  The  Division  has  become  the global  market  leader  in  luxury  beauty  thanks  to  its  strong momentum  in  developed  and  emerging  markets  and  its remarkable  outperformance  in  China.  There,  the  early adoption  of  Douyin  and  the  ongoing  investment  in  point-ofsale quality paid off.\n\nFragrances remained the star performer, driven by Yves Saint Laurent with  the  worldwide  blockbuster Libre and  the successful  launch  of MYSLF ,  as  well  as Born  in  Roma by Valentino , Paradoxe by Prada , Wanted by Azzaro and Angel by Mugler .  In  skincare,  ultra-luxury  brand Helena  Rubinstein passed  the  one-billion-euro  mark,  and Takami advanced strongly  in  the  medical  luxury  segment.  Makeup  momentum accelerated  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  driven  by  the Couture brands.\n\nMore recently added brands like Prada , Takami and Valentino made  strong  growth  contributions.

As a result, sales have more than doubled in just three years.\n\nThis was driven by the Division's unrivalled portfolio of highly complementary  brands,  its  online and  offline channel coverage, and its longstanding medical prescription leadership.\n\nMomentum was strong across all regions  and  well-balanced between developed and emerging markets. In mainland China, the Division significantly outperformed a market that proved resilient.\n\nLa Roche-Posay , the number one growth contributor, kept its outstanding  pace,  driven  by  the UVmune400 ,  breakthrough innovation  in  sun  care,  as  well  as  the  successful Cicaplast microbiome renovation. CeraVe continued to advance strongly  both  in  the  US,  where  it  is  now  the  number  one skincare brand, and in the rest of the world. Vichy reported its best  growth  in  18  years,  while  the  portfolio  of  aestheticsrelated brands grew in double digits.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Dermatological Beauty places three of its key brands in  the  top-four  most  prescribed  brands  by  dermatologists  in the world.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Sales in  Europe saw outstanding growth of +16.0% like-forlike and +13.7% reported.\n\nThroughout  the  year,  the  beauty  market  was  very  dynamic, and L'Or\u00e9al outperformed across all of its core Western and Central  European  countries.  Thanks  to  its  outstanding progress,  the  region  was  the  single  largest  growth  driver  at Group level for the second year running.\n\nVolume and value both contributed strongly, the latter fueled by mix and price. All categories advanced in double-digits, led by skincare and makeup.\n\nProfessional  Products  continued  to  recruit  new  consumers and  develop  its  position  in  premium  haircare  thanks  to K\u00e9rastase and  the  strong  momentum  of S\u00e9rie  Expert by L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel . In Consumer Products, each of the four key  brands  recorded  exceptional  growth.  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe further  strengthened  its  leadership  in  fragrances,  driven  by Libre by Yves Saint Laurent - now the second largest female women's fragrance in Europe after Lanc\u00f4me's La Vie Est Belle -and  by Paradoxe by Prada . Dermatological  Beauty outperformed its market significantly; thanks to the continued strong  growth  of CeraVe ,  the  Division  now  has  three  of  the top-four dermo-cosmetics brands in Europe.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  continued  to  strengthen  its  position  in  the  most dynamic channels: drugstores, e-commerce, and pharmacies.\n\n## North America\n\n## Sales in North America advanced strongly, +11.8% like-for-like and +9.7% reported.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al outperformed a dynamic market, driven by valorising innovations  and  channel  optimisation.  Each  of  the  Divisions grew, led by Dermatological Beauty and L'Or\u00e9al Luxe.\n\nThe Professional Products Division outperformed the market thanks  to  its  well-rounded  brand  portfolio  with  K\u00e9rastase particularly dynamic. This was backed by its strong innovation pipeline, and its omni-channel focus, where selective channels and e-commerce outperformed.\n\nConsumer Products grew strongly in haircare, boosted by the continued  success  of  the  core  Elvive  and  Ever  haircare franchises. In a vibrant makeup market, momentum remained strong, supported by a well-filled innovation pipeline across all brands.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Luxe outperformed the market in fragrances, led by Born in Roma by Valentino and MYSLF by Yves Saint Laurent . In  makeup,  Couture  brands Yves  Saint  Laurent and Armani were  bolstered  by  new  launches.  E-commerce  remained dynamic, particularly during the holiday season.\n\nDermatological Beauty continued its exceptional performance,  outperforming  the  market  thanks  to  the uninterrupted  success  of CeraVe ,  now  the  number  one  skin care brand in the US, and La Roche Posay .

In mainland  China,  where  the  beauty  market  remained  flat, L'Or\u00e9al grew +5.4%, significantly strengthening its leadership - boosted by the Group's continued investment in the quality of  its  offline  distribution  in  a  truly  O+O  (offline  plus  online) market.  In  Hong  Kong  SAR,  momentum  was  buoyant,  as  tourist activity  resumed.

It  is  made  available  to  the  public  according  to the terms of the regulations in force and may be viewed on the www.loreal-finance.com website.\n\n## Finance\n\n- \u00b7 In May, L'Or\u00e9al successfully completed a bond issue totalling 2 billion euros, the net proceeds of which will be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  in  particular  the acquisition of A\u0113sop.\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nAs  we  head  into  2024,  we  remain  optimistic  about  the outlook for the beauty market, and confident in our ability to  keep  outperforming  it  and  to  achieve  another  year  of growth in sales and profits.\n\nMore than ever, L'Or\u00e9al is looking to the future - a future that will have Beauty Tech at its very core. Beauty Tech will shape our industry and enable us to further strengthen our leadership.  It  will  allow  us  to  know  our  consumers  everbetter, to bring them ever-more impactful and sustainable products and services and to become ever-sharper in our execution.\n\n## 1.4.1.5. L'Or\u00e9al's investment policy responds to long-term objectives\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  growing  manufacturing  company  thanks  largely to two types of investments:\n\n- 1. scientific and  manufacturing  investments,  which  are described  in  several  sections  (see  sections  1.3.7.  and 1.3.8.) ; and\n- 2. marketing  investments,  which  are  made  on  an  ongoing basis  and  are  inherent  to  the  Group's  activities  in  the cosmetics  industry.  Indeed,  winning  new  market  share requires in-depth and situation-specific studies, as well as advertising and promotional expenses attuned not only to the  familiarity  of  brands  and  their  competitive  position, but also to constant changes in consumers' aspirations something  that  the  subsidiaries'  sales  and  marketing teams monitor constantly. Lastly, investments in point-of sale (POS) advertising materials ensure optimal presence for our brands in points of sale.\n\nFor  reasons  relating  to  strategy  and  competition,  L'Or\u00e9al cannot  therefore  provide  any  systematic  information  on future investments.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group's  investments  totalled  \u20ac1,489  million,  or 3.6%  of  its  sales.  This  level  reflects  the  Group's  constant efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  efficiency,  research  and digital development performance and enhance brand value.\n\nInvestment  commitments  in  2023  can  be  broken  down  as follows : production and the physical supply chain represented approximately 24% of total investments; marketing investments, including moulds, POS advertising materials and stores  accounted  for  34%;  IT  investments  spread  over  all these  categories  represented  23%  of  total  investments; research  and  the  head  offices  in  the  different  countries accounted for the remainder (1) .  Despite their strategic nature, none  of  these  investments  taken  individually  is  material enough at Group level to warrant more detailed disclosure.",

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): shared and lasting growth\n\n## Priority to Human Capital\n\nAs  the  Group's  founder,  Eug\u00e8ne  Schueller,  declared  with conviction:  'a  company  is  not  walls  and  machines  but  people, people and more people.'\n\nEmployees  are  the  driving  force  behind  the  Group  and  one of its major competitive advantages. They are working to roll out  the  Group's  vision  through  its  portfolio  of  brands,  its governance, its research and innovation, data and technology in its transformation.\n\nThe  Group's  human  and  social  project  revolves  around  one vision:  to  offer  its  employees  an  inspiring,  inclusive  and innovative  working  environment,  which  places  human  beings at  the  heart  of  each  of  its  decisions.  This  is  reflected  in particular in developing the individual and collective performances of its employees and investing in the skills of the future.  This  also  relies  on  a  working  environment  that promotes  engagement  and  collective  performance,  where growth is shared with employees.\n\nSocial innovation is at the heart of this approach, particularly with  the Share  &  Care programme,  the L'Or\u00e9al  For  All Generations programme or the programmes to transform our working  methods  ( Simplicity  2 or Best  of  Both ,  the  hybrid working policy).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.\n\nSince  its  very  beginnings,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying the  fundamental  rules  of  a  good  corporate  citizen.  The products  offered  to  consumers  meet  the  highest  quality standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all its subsidiaries. Social audits are also carried out on suppliers.\n\nAs far as its resources allow, each subsidiary takes part in the financing  of  sponsorship  initiatives  in  keeping  with  the  key pillars of the Group's commitment to philanthropy. Above and beyond  its  solid  long-term  economic  performances,  L'Or\u00e9al seeks to be exemplary and sets itself demanding standards in order  to  limit  its  environmental  footprint.  All  production centres  comply  with  the  same  rules  aimed  at  reducing  their environmental footprint.\n\nAll these aspects are set out in more detail in subsection 4.3.2.\n\n## Focus: sharing growth with employees\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme is a large-scale social programme initiated in 2013. It consists of commitments revolving around four pillars that were enhanced in 2021 and 2023, and implemented in all countries: social protection, healthcare, work/life balance and the working environment.\n\n## Healthcare\n\n## Protection\n\nProviding employees and their families with su/fficient financial support for unexpected life events.\n\n## Work/life balance\n\nEnabling all employees to fully experience milestones in life such as parenthood and enabling working organisation for a good work/life balance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSharing value with employees includes the measures detailed in particular in paragraphs 4.3.2.4, 'Creating conditions for a stimulating  and  attractive  work  environment'  and  4.3.2.5.

In the firm belief that sustainability is an essential factor for success and durability,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  deploying  an  ambitious  corporate  social responsibility  policy,  which  is  shared  by  its  management  and teams (see section 4.3.).\n\n2023 Financial Results and Corporate Social Responsibility commitments\n\nIn  June  2020,  the  second  generation  of  its  commitments  to sustainability was  launched  under  the  umbrella  of  its programme L'Or\u00e9al for the Future ,  with  a  set  of  targets  for 2030,  in  order  to  cover  all  the  impacts  associated  with  the Group's  value  chain:  its  production  and  distribution  sites  as well as its supply chains and the impacts associated with the use of products by consumers. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future marks a new ambition for the sustainability of L'Or\u00e9al with the  intention  to  capitalise  on  previous  achievements:  the commitment  from  2009  to  reduce  the  environmental footprint  of  factories  and  distribution  centres  by  50% compared  to  2005,  then  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme  launched  in  2013  with  sustainable  production, sustainable  innovation,  sustainable  consumption  and  shared growth targets for 2020, which has made sustainability one of the Group's key strategic pillars.\n\nIn  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  undertook  to  define  Science  Based  Targets (SBTs)  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  across  its entire value chain and over the long term, in accordance with the  Paris  Agreement  on  climate  change.  In  December  2017, the  SBT  initiative  (SBTi)  validated  the  Group's  proposal: L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on its  Scopes  1,  2  and  3  by  25%  in  absolute  value  by  2030, compared with the 2016 baseline.\n\nAccording to the revised requirements of the SBTi Net-Zero standard, in October 2023 the Group submitted its new 2030 and  2050  trajectory  towards  reducing  its  carbon  intensity. When  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  Management Report, L'Or\u00e9al was waiting for the SBTi to validate this new trajectory.  This  will  be  published  in  the  2024  Universal Registration Document.",

It also participates in the Group's development by  promoting  the  good  use  of  resources  to  minimise  the impact  of  negative  events  and  maximise  the  realisation  of opportunities.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  the  purpose  of  the  Internal  Control system is to enable the Group's manufacturing and economic development  to  take  place  in  a  steady  and  sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses.\n\nInternal Control is a system that applies to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with  the  laws  and  regulations  in  force  and  the  Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n\n## Major risks to which the Group believes it is exposed\n\n|                                     |                                                                            | Residual  importance   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Business risks                      | Information and cybersecurity systems*                                     |                        |\n| Business risks                      | Geographic presence and economic and political environment*                |                        |\n|                                     | Sanitary crisis*                                                           |                        |\n|                                     | Reputational crisis management                                             |                        |\n|                                     | Data                                                                       |                        |\n|                                     | Market and Innovation                                                      |                        |\n|                                     | Business ethics                                                            |                        |\n|                                     | Evolution of sales channels                                                |                        |\n|                                     | Human Resources risk                                                       |                        |\n|                                     | Product quality and safety                                                 |                        |\n|                                     | The safety of people and property                                          |                        |\n| Industrial and  environmental risks | Product availability*                                                      |                        |\n| Industrial and  environmental risks | Climate change                                                             |                        |\n|                                     | Environment and safety                                                     |                        |\n| Legal and regulatory  risks         | Non-conformity*                                                            |                        |\n| Legal and regulatory  risks         | Intellectual property: trademarks, designs & models, domain names, patents |                        |\n|                                     | Product claims                                                             |                        |\n| Financial and market  risks         | Inflation and currency risk*                                               |                        |\n| Financial and market  risks         | Risk on financial equity interests                                         |                        |\n| Financial and market  risks         | Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets                       |                        |\n\n*\n\nMost material risks in each category.\n\nResidual importance: Low\n\nModerate\n\nSignificant\n\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nThe  control  environment,  which  is  critical  to  the  Internal Control system, good risk management and the application of procedures,  is based  on  behaviour,  the  organisational structure and employees.

Framework for the implementation of corporate governance principles\n\n## 2.1.1. AFEP-MEDEF Code: the reference Code\n\nThe  Code  of  Corporate  Governance  to  which  the  Company refers is the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThis chapter includes (1) a  specific section of the Management Report on corporate governance and reports on the following, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Board's  composition  and  application  of  the  principle of balanced gender representation on the Board;\n- \u00b7 the ways in which the Board's work is prepared and organised;\n- \u00b7 the compensation policy for directors and corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 information  relating  to  the  remuneration  and  benefits  of any  kind  for  directors  and  corporate  officers  during  the previous financial year pursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code; and\n- \u00b7 limitations placed by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe other information included in the particular section of the Management  Report  dedicated  to  corporate  governance  is published in chapter 7, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 the table summarising the authorisations in force granted by the Annual General Meeting (see subsection 7.2.2.);\n- \u00b7 the  special  rules  for  shareholder  participation  in  the  Annual General Meeting or the provisions of the Articles of Association providing for these rules (see subsection 7.1.4.); and\n- \u00b7 the  elements  with  the  potential  to  have  an  impact  in  the event of a public offer for the purchase or exchange of the Company's securities (see section 7.3.).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  this  chapter  identifies,  in  a  summary table,  those  provisions  of  this  Code  which  were  not  applied and explains the reasons for that choice (see section 2.5.).\n\n## 2.1.2. Balance of power within the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.1.2.1. General Management procedures: Separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a method of corporate governance that is suited to its specificities and is part of a constant quest for progress. The  procedures  for  exercising  the  General  Management  of L'Or\u00e9al have always been decided in the best interest of the Company  and  with  the  constant  concern  that  the  mode of  governance  chosen  will  make  it  possible  to  optimise  the Group's  performance  and  to  create  the  most  favourable conditions for its long-term development.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, the duties of Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  those  of  Chief  Executive  Officer  were separated,  with  Sir  Lindsay  Owen-Jones  assuming  the functions of Chairman and Mr Jean-Paul Agon those of Chief Executive Officer. In 2011. The Board of Directors decided to merge these positions and to appoint Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  responsible  for  the Company's  General  Management  (Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al),  roles  that  he  held  until 30 April 2021.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  separate  the  functions from  1  May  2021,  appoint  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  Chief Executive  Officer  and  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  mandate as  Chairman.  The  Board  reiterated  this  decision  on  21  April 2022 on the occasion of the renewal of term of office  as  a Director of Jean-Paul Agon.\n\nMr Nicolas  Hieronimus  joined  L'Or\u00e9al  36  years  ago.  He  held various positions in marketing before being named to General Management (L'Or\u00e9al Paris France, L'Or\u00e9al Paris World and L'Or\u00e9al Mexico). In 2008, he was appointed General Manager of the Professional Products Division and joined the Executive Committee.  In  January  2011,  he  was  appointed  Chief Executive Officer of L'Or\u00e9al Luxe, a role that he held until the end  of  2018.  In  2013,  he  became  President  of  the  Selective Divisions (Luxe, Active Cosmetics, Professional Products). He was named Deputy CEO in charge of Divisions in May 2017.\n\nThis structure seeks to ensure the sustainability of the Group's performance, values and commitments, as well as the quality of its governance.",

The Board of Directors can count on  his  expertise  in  matters  of  governance  to  meet  the growing expectations of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus provides his expertise in the cosmetics market and his intimate knowledge of L'Or\u00e9al, as well as his vision  of  the  future  of  Beauty,  to  implement  the  strategic orientations  of  years  to  come,  take  advantage  of  all  the opportunities  offered  by  a  fast-changing  world,  adapt  the Group and reinvent it in keeping with its values, commitments and purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) to 'Create the beauty that moves the world'.\n\n## 2.1.2.2. Key role of the composition and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## A harmonious composition\n\nThe balance of powers on the Board of Directors principally rests on its coherent and harmonious composition and on the qualities of its Directors.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Board of Directors is made up of the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  three  Directors (one  of  whom  is  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Board)  from  the Bettencourt  Meyers  family,  two  Directors  (one  of  whom  is Vice-Chairman  of  the  Board)  linked  to  Nestl\u00e9,  seven independent  Directors  and  two  Directors  representing  the employees.\n\nThus 50% of the Board are independent Directors (1) ,  who are highly  committed  and  fully  play  their  role  given  their backgrounds and experience. They all hold responsibilities at the  highest  level  in  major  international  groups,  which  allows them to understand all the dimensions of L'Or\u00e9al's operations, clarify Board discussions and interact effectively with General Management.\n\nAll  Board  members  participate  in  the  discussions  and  are a driving force for ideas. The diversity and complementarity of experience and  expertise of the directors, with their entrepreneurial and international backgrounds and their skills in financial matters and sustainability, give them a rapid and in-depth understanding of the development challenges facing L'Or\u00e9al. This is essential for L'Or\u00e9al, the leader in a globalised and highly competitive cosmetics market where the demands for innovation and adaptation are very high.\n\n## Specialised active and effective Committees of the Board\n\nThe  establishment  of  Board  Committees,  their  composition and  responsibilities  contribute  to  a  good  balance  of  power and are a point of attention for the Board of Directors. In fact, the  Board  has  set  up  specialised  committees  to  help  all Directors carry out their main duties collectively. The term of office,  composition  and  operating  procedures  of  the  Board are  defined  in  its  Internal  Rules,  which  are  published  by  the Board of Directors (see 2.3.3.).\n\nAll Committees have a high number of independent Directors: 60% for the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Remuneration  Committee,  and  50%  for  the  Nominations and  Governance  Committee.  The  Chairman  of  each  of these  Committees  is  independent.  Only  the  Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee,  the  organisation  of  which  is  not regulated,  is  chaired  by  a  non-independent  Director  within the meaning of the AFEP-MEDEF Code: the Chairman of the\n\nBoard  of  Directors.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  not  a member of any Committee.\n\nThese  committees  are  completely  free  to  draw  up  their respective  agendas.  They  report  on  their  work  to  the  Board of Directors, whose meetings they prepare and to which they make proposals.\n\nAs part of its review of its activities at the end of 2023, the Board  again  emphasised  the  quality  of  the  work  and recommendations of its Committees, which helped to inform its decisions.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nSince  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  met  in  executive sessions, at one or two meetings per year.\n\nThe  Board  considers  that  these  meetings,  which  are  not attended  by  any  corporate  officers  or  any  employees  of the  Group,  contribute  to  good  governance.  Initially  attended by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  executive  sessions  then continue without him.\n\n## Regular evaluation of the organisation and functioning of the Board\n\nAs  part  of  the  annual  assessment  of  the  way  the  Board operates, each year Directors set themselves new objectives to  improve  the  quality  of  their  organisation.  They  seek to achieve optimum effectiveness and ensure that they have the necessary assets to carry out their duties successfully and with complete freedom to act.\n\n## Attentive prevention of conflicts of interest\n\nThe Directors are required to act in all circumstances in the interest  of  the  Company  and  of  all  its  shareholders.  Every year,  the  Board  of  Directors  assesses  the  situation  of  the Directors  using  the  conflict  of  interest  prevention  process. Each Director has the obligation to report potential conflicts of  interest  which  could  concern  him/her  and,  in  any  event, must abstain from participating in the corresponding debates and deliberations.\n\n## 2.1.2.3. Relationships between the Board and General Management\n\n## Powers and duties of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that the Chief Executive Officer is granted the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name  of  the  Company, in  compliance  with  the  limits  set  by  the  Board;  however, transactions  of  a  significant  amount  or  falling  outside  the Company's  normal  course  of  business  are  submitted  to  the Board  of  Directors  (see  article  1.2.2.  of  the  Board's  Internal Rules).\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus exercises these powers within the limit of  the  Company's  purpose  subject  to  the  powers  expressly granted by French law to Annual General Meetings and the Board of Directors. He represents the Company in its dealings with third parties.\n\nThe  Chief Executive Officer communicates  completely transparently with all the Directors and keeps them regularly informed  of  all  aspects  of  the  Company's  affairs  and  its performances. He is required to provide each Director with all documents  and  information  required  to  perform  their  remit. More  specifically,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  provides the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the Company if the importance or urgency of the information",

This provision of ongoing information also includes any relevant information concerning the  Company,  and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports containing financial analysis. The Chief Executive Officer gives the Board and its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior  managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  within  the  strict  framework  of their  remits  and  duties.  In  consultation  with  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Board  and  the  Committees  may  use external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board provides the General Management with invaluable support  for  strategic  decision-making  through  its  reflections and the impetus it provides.\n\n## Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board stipulate the following duties of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the Board of Directors: 'The Chairman of the Board of Directors organises and oversees the Board's work and reports thereon to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players. The Chairman  oversees  the  work  of  the  Company's  bodies responsible for corporate governance and ensures, in  particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their duties. He may ask for the communication of any document or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote the values and image of the Company at all times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe  is  provided  with  the  material  resources  required  to perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care  to  develop  and maintain  a  trustful  and  regular  relationship  between  the Board  and  the  General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee continuous, ongoing implementation by the General Management of the strategies defined by the Board'.\n\nThe Board decided to broaden the Chairman's remit to take account of Mr Jean-Paul Agon's experience and expertise, as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Group and the beauty market.  In  all  these  specific  missions,  the  Chairman  acts  in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer who alone directs  and  manages  the  Company's  operations.  Mr  JeanPaul Agon, as Chairman of the Board of Directors, provides his  assistance  and  advice  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, particularly in the implementation of the strategic orientations of the Company defined by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 he is informed and consulted by the Chief Executive Officer on  all  significant  issues  and  events,  such  as  proposed acquisitions  or  disposals,  major  financial  transactions, financial  communication,  the  guidelines  of  the  Human Resources policy and appointments of the Group's principal executives, Ethics and issues of Corporate Social Responsibility;\n- \u00b7 he  monitors,  in  collaboration  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer, certain equity interests, including L'Or\u00e9al's stake in Sanofi;\n- \u00b7 in  collaboration  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  he  can represent  the  Group  in  its  high-level  relations,  both nationally and internationally, including with public authorities, and L'Or\u00e9al's strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 he ensures respect for L'Or\u00e9al's values and culture;\n- \u00b7 he  can  hear  the  Statutory  Auditors  for  the  preparation of the work of the Board and the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  chairs  and  leads  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 he  meets  with  the  members  of  the  Board  outside  the presence  of  Directors  belonging  or  reporting  to  General Management;  these  meetings  serve  as  an  opportunity  to discuss  the  performance  and  remuneration  of  executive corporate officers; and\n- \u00b7 he reports to the Board on the performance of his mission.",

These skills are supplemented by a dedicated learning plan to ensure L'Or\u00e9al's  specific  characteristics  are  fully  understood  and they are nurtured further by high-level presentations at Board and Committee meetings.\n\nThe  above  table  gives  an  overview  of  the  skills  matrix  for Directors. As a result, the Board is made up of a rich range of experience in various business sectors and expertise in various fields,  which  means  it  is  able  to  meet  the  strategic  and performance  challenges  L'Or\u00e9al  faces.  Moreover,  regardless of  their  individual  nationalities,  nearly  two-thirds  of  the Directors have spent part of their careers working abroad.\n\nThis skills matrix is monitored  and  reviewed  by  the Nominations and Governance Committee and by the Board of Directors,  with  particular  regard  to  determining  the  profiles to be identified when the composition of the Board changes. This  ensures  that  the  Committee  is  able  to  adopt  both  a short-to-medium-  and  long-term  forward-looking  vision (12  years  maximum,  in  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code's independence requirements) to develop skills that are in keeping with the Company's strategic orientations and that complement  or  strengthen  those  already  present  on  the Board.  In  this  way,  the  Board  is  provided  with  the  key  skills identified in the matrix on an ongoing basis. The Directors also assess this themselves as part of the annual evaluation of the Board.\n\n## SELECTING NEW DIRECTORS\n\nThe procedure for selecting new Directors is described in Article 5.3.1. of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, which is reproduced in full in subsection 2.3.6.\n\n## Selection process for new independent Directors appointed by the Annual General Meeting\n\n| Profile                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Applications                                                                                                                 | Selection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Appointment                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Definition of the profile sought by the Nominations and Governance  Committee (NGC) in terms of: \u00b7 the medium- to long-term  projection of the Board's  composition \u00b7 the skills and experience sought to  complement that of the existing | \u00b7 Selection of  a recruitment firm. \u00b7 Discussions and review  within the NGC. \u00b7 Establishment of a list  of candidates to be | \u00b7 Discussion of the proposed  profiles: match with the identified  needs, checking with rules  of the AFEP-MEDEF code (number of directorships held  simultaneously, independence). \u00b7 Individual meetings with the  Chairman of the Board and each | \u00b7 Approval by the Board of the draft resolution  concerning  the appointment of a  new Director at the  Annual General Meeting. |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | submitted to members of the NGC.                                                                                             | member of the NGC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \u00b7 Approval by the Board of the draft resolution  concerning  the appointment of a  new Director at the  Annual General Meeting. |\n\n## 2.2.1.3.

As soon as they take up their office, the Directors representing employees, just like all L'Or\u00e9al  Directors,  received  support  in  the  form  of dedicated  meetings  with,  in  particular,  the  Chairman  of  the Board,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Chairman  of  the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Secretary of the Board of Directors.",

With this in mind, the  criteria  that  guide  the  Board  in  determining  whether a  member  can  qualify  as  independent  are  the  following criteria specified by the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  be  an  employee  or  executive corporate officer of the Company, an employee or executive corporate officer or Director of a company that is consolidated by the Company, or an employee or executive corporate officer or Director of its parent company or of a company  consolidated  by  that  parent  company  and  must not have held any of these positions during the previous five years;\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  be  an  executive  corporate  officer of  a  company  in  which  the  Company  directly  or  indirectly holds  the  tenure  as  Director  or  in  which  an  employee designated as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (either currently or having performed such duties within the last five years) holds a tenure as Director;\n- \u00b7 the member must not be a customer, supplier, investment banker,  financial  banker,  or  advisor  significant  to  the Company  or  its  Group,  or  for  whom  the  Company  or  its Group represents a significant proportion of business;\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  any  close  family  ties  to  a director or corporate officer;\n- \u00b7 the member must not have been the Company's Statutory Auditor over the previous five years; and\n- \u00b7 the  member  must  not  have  been  a  Director  of  the Company for more than twelve years.\n\nAt its  meeting held on 8 February 2024, the Board of Directors examined, on a case-by-case basis, the situation of each of the members concerned in light of the independence criteria provided for in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n|                     | Not an employee or executive  corporate officer   | No cross- directorships   | No significant business  relationships   | No family  links   | Not a  Statutory  Auditor   | Not a Director  for more  than 12 years   | Classification adopted   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Ms Sophie Bellon    | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Mr Patrice Caine    | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Ms Fabienne Dulac   | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo     | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Ms Ilham Kadri      | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Ms Virginie Morgon  | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n| Mr Alexandre Ricard | yes                                               | yes                       | yes                                      | yes                | yes                         | yes                                       | Independent              |\n\nBased  on  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  analysed  on 8 February 2024, as it does every year, whether any business relationship exists with these Directors. Business relationships refer to the financial flows that took place during financial year 2023 between L'Or\u00e9al and companies in which the Directors who qualify as independent also hold an office or position. As to the significance of the business relationship, and in keeping with  French  Financial  Markets  Authority  (AMF)  recommendations,  the  Board  of  Directors  carried  out  a  quantitative  and qualitative analysis, adopting a wide multi-criteria approach (duration and continuity, importance of the business relationship for L'Or\u00e9al and the Director, and organisation of the relationship). Following this analysis, the Board concluded there was no significant business relationships.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  specified  that  the  following  are  not considered  to  be  independent:  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  (former executive corporate officer for less than five years and  Director  since  2006);  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  (executive corporate officer); Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr  Jean-Victor  Meyers  and  Mr  Nicolas  Meyers  (Bettencourt Meyers family holding 34.73% of the share capital); Mr Paul Bulcke  and  Ms  B\u00e9atrice  Guillaume-Grabisch  (Nestl\u00e9  holding 20.13% of the share capital).\n\n## 2.2.1.5. Responsible Directors\n\nWithin the scope of French law and the rights and obligations of  the  Directors  as  defined  in  the  Internal  Rules  of  the Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  and  in  accordance  with  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Directors are subject to compliance with the rules in force with regard to conflicts of interest and stock market  ethics  upon  their  appointment  as  a  Director  and throughout their term of office.\n\n## Selection of responsible Directors\n\nDirectors are appointed, subject to approval from the Annual General  Meeting,  following  a  selection  process.  This  process determines the Director profiles required by the Company in terms  of  skills,  qualifications  and  experience  needed  to complement those of the Directors already appointed. Issues such as candidates' availability, numbers of directorships held and independence are also considered (see 2.2.1.2.). Particular attention is also paid to directorships held in other companies; Directors  are  required  to  devote  the  necessary  time  and attention  to  their  duties  and  limit  the  number  of  their directorships  to  ensure  their  availability  (article  3.3.  of  the Internal Rules of the Board).\n\nWhen joining the Board of Directors, each Director receives a copy  of  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  and  the  Articles  of Association of L'Or\u00e9al, the Stock Market Code of Ethics, the Code  of  Ethics  etc.  These  codes  adopted  by  the  Company serve  as  a  frame  of  reference  for  Directors  in  terms  of  the standards  required  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  this  area.  As  soon  as  they take up their office, Directors will also receive support in the form of dedicated meetings with, in particular, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nMembers  of  the  Board  of  Directors  require  the  necessary objectivity to make an independent judgement on the conduct of the Company's  business. The balance of powers established  within  the  Board  allows  its  members  to  exercise independent judgement. The Board is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  directly  contributes  to the  work,  discussions  and,  ultimately,  the  decisions  taken by the Board;\n- \u00b7 the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  who  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  an  ongoing  relationship  of trust  between  the  Board  and  the  General  Management, particularly in view of his expertise in matters  of governance and the quality of his discussions with the Chief Executive  Officer,  based  on  a  relationship  of  trust established over the course of many years;\n- \u00b7 Directors  from  major  shareholders  that  have  a  specific interest in the long-term performance of the Company;\n- \u00b7 seven  independent  Directors  with  experience  as  senior managers of large international groups, whose independence of  thought,  sense  of  perspective  and  freedom  of  speech enable them  to challenge and support the General Management in defining the Group's strategy; and\n- \u00b7 two  Directors  representing  the  employees,  who  have extensive knowledge of the Company (see 2.2.1.3.).\n\n## Responsible exercise of office\n\nTo maintain a high standard, the Board of Directors, based on the  work  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee, shall  ensure  that,  throughout  their  term  of  office,  Directors are able to act in the best interests of the Company, with all the  due  diligence  and  care  required  and  subject  to  a  strict confidentiality and loyalty obligation.\n\nDirectors must keep the Board informed of the directorships they  hold  in  other  companies,  including  any  involvement  in Board  Committees  of  such  French  or  foreign  companies. They  are  required  to  notify  the  Board  of  any  situation  that may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such  conflict  is only  potential,  and  must  refrain  from  participating  in  the corresponding deliberations.\n\nIn  addition,  each  year  all  Directors  must  issue  a  declaration relating to potential conflicts of interest between their duties to L'Or\u00e9al  and  their  private  or  professional  interests, specifically  with  regard  to  other  directorships  and  roles.  Any relevant  information  disclosed  in  this  way  is  made  public. Based on these declarations, the Board of Directors has not identified any  conflict  of  interests  on  the  date  these declarations  were  issued  pursuant  to  Delegated  European Regulation No. 2019/980 supplementing Regulation No. 2017/1129, known as 'Prospectus 3'.\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  conducts  an annual  review  of  the  summary  table  prepared  by  the Company  of  the  financial  flows  that  occurred  during  the financial  year  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  interested  parties  as defined  by  regulations  in  order  to  report  to  the  Board  of Directors as part of the regular procedure to evaluate current agreements signed under normal terms pursuant to Article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code. In case of doubts  about  the  classification  of  an  agreement,  the Committee  must  verify  that  the  transactions  have  been concluded  in  ordinary  course  of  business  and  under  normal conditions, so that the Board of Directors can implement the procedure  for  related-party  agreements  when  necessary. In  this  case,  the  persons  directly  or  indirectly  interested  in this agreement  do  not  participate  in  the  assessment. In accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the recommendations  of  the  French  financial  markets  authority ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers -  AMF),  the  Board  of Directors, based on the work carried out by the Nominations and  Governance  Committee,  also  analyses  each  year  any possible business relationships between L'Or\u00e9al and companies in which independent Directors hold directorships or  perform  functions,  to  ensure  these  relationships  are  not significant (see 2.2.1.4).",

The Nominations and Governance  Committee  Meeting  of  6  December  2016 examined  this  arrangement  prior  to  signature  of  the agreement and considered that it could not be contested on the  basis  of  the  Company's  interests,  nor  could  it  lead  to consequences  for  the  Company's  governance,  and  informed the Board of Directors accordingly.\n\nThe  Company  was  informed  that  a  new  collective  lock-up agreement  was  signed  on  29  December  2023  under Article 787 B of the French General Tax Code, similar to those entered  into  in  2016  (which  had  been  terminated  earlier  the same  day),  with  the  addition  of  the  company  Financi\u00e8re L'Arcouest  (controlled  by  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers and her family). The Nominations and Governance Committee Meeting of 6 December 2023 examined this arrangement in advance and confirmed that it could not be contested on the basis  of  the  Company's  interests,  nor  could  it  lead  to consequences  for  the  Company's  governance,  and  informed the Board of Directors accordingly.\n\n## Information on service contracts with members of the administrative bodies (Article 12.2 of the Annex)\n\nNo directors or corporate officers have a service contract with L'Or\u00e9al  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  providing  for  the  granting of benefits upon termination of such contract.\n\n## Stock market ethics\n\nThe  Board  noted  the  rules  to  be  applied  to  prevent  insider trading,  in  particular  those  resulting  from  European  Regulation (EU)  No.  596/2014  on  Market  Abuse  which  became  applicable on 3 July 2016, and the recommendations of the French financial markets  authority  (AMF),  in  particular  regarding  the  periods during which it is prohibited from trading in shares. It decided to amend its Internal Rules accordingly.\n\nOn the basis  of  the  legal  provisions,  regulations  and  market recommendations, L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Ethics Code points out that inside information must only be passed on and used for professional purposes.\n\nInside  information  is  information  of  a  precise  nature,  which has not been made public and which, if it were made public, would likely to have a significant effect on the share price.\n\nThe  Stock  Market  Code  of  Ethics  restates  the  ban  on  any person  in  possession  of  insider  information  from  executing or ordering the execution of financial transactions on L'Or\u00e9al shares, and emphasises that any misconduct in this area may result in criminal proceedings. The Internal Rules of the Board specifically  ask  Directors  to  refrain  from  trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al shares precisely in certain periods and when they have access to inside information.\n\nThe  Directors  are  required  to  notify  the  AMF  of  each transaction  carried  out  by  them  or  by  persons  closely associated  with  them  related  to  L'Or\u00e9al  shares.  This obligation  is  periodically  restated  by  the  Company  (see summary of these operations in section 2.6.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Departure of Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo\n\nThe meeting of the Board of Directors on 8 February 2024 recorded Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo's wish to stand down as Director at the close of the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024, two years  before  her  term  of  office  expires,  on  the  grounds  of availability  associated  with  her  professional  activities.  The Board  of  Directors  thanked  Ms  Garijo  for  her  high-quality contribution  to  the  work  of  the  Board  and  the  Human Resources and Remuneration Committee during her 10 years in office.\n\n## 2.3. Organisation and modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.3.1. General information on the meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees in 2023\n\nThe Board met eight times in 2023.\n\nFour Committees prepare for the discussions and deliberations by the Board. 18 meetings were held in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 5 meetings of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 5 meetings of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 4  meetings  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee; and\n- \u00b7 4  meetings  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee.\n\nDirectors  may  independently  propose  any  subject  that  is appropriate  for  good  governance  to  be  included  on  the agenda for work of the Board and its Committees. L'Or\u00e9al's Directors  are  regularly  informed  of  all  the  Company's activities  and  its  performances  in  a  highly  competitive universe. Board meetings are generally held in the presence of senior  managers  of  the  Company  invited  to  attend  on  the basis of topical developments at L'Or\u00e9al and many aspects of its  strategy.  In  an  open,  constructive  dialogue,  exchanges  of views, in confidence, contribute to the quality of the Directors' work.  Board  discussions,  encouraged  by  the  Chairman,  take place transparently and in great detail.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nDirectors meet at least once a year without the presence of the executive corporate  officer, Directors representing employees  or  any  other  Group  employee  (Article  4.2  of  the Internal Rules). An executive session was held on 7 December 2023.  The  Chairman  of  the  Board  attended  initially,  after which  he  withdrew  and  the  executive  session  continued without him. The Audit Committee also meets twice a year in the presence of Statutory Auditors and in the absence of any representative from Management, at the end of the meetings dedicated  to  reviewing  the  annual  and  interim  financial statements. These two meetings were held on 9 February and 27 July 2023.\n\n## Attendance rate\n\nThe  preparation  and  holding  of  Board  and  Committee meetings requires significant availability and investment by the Directors. In 2023, the attendance rate at Board meetings was 96.1% on average. The individual attendance rate at Board and Committee  meetings  is  specified  below.  The  allocation  of Directors'  fees,  based  on  the  rate  of  attendance  by  each member  at  Board  meetings  and  meetings  of  the  various Committees, is described in section 2.4.",

this Committee in 2023.\n\n## 2.3.2. Activities of the Board of Directors\n\nEvery  year,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Board  of  Directors  determines L'Or\u00e9al's  strategic  directions,  which  integrate  the  challenges of climate  change  and,  more  generally,  the  issues  of sustainability, ethics and the sense of purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) to  'Create  the  Beauty  that  moves  the  world'.  The  Board ensures these strategic directions are implemented, in  accordance  with  its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social and  environmental  challenges  of  its  business  activity  into consideration.\n\nThe economic and financial position and the cash position are reviewed at least twice a year at a Board meeting, when the annual  financial  statements  are  approved  and  when  the interim  financial  statements  are  reviewed,  or  at  any  other time if necessary.\n\nEach  of  the  four  Consultative  Committees  set  up  by  the Board of Directors to work on topics falling within their field of expertise  is  involved  in  determining  and  monitoring  the strategy. The Committees' work systematically gives rise to a report  presented  by  their  Chairman/Chairwoman  at  Board meetings.\n\nThe work of the  Board  of  Directors  is  governed  by  a  set  of Internal  Rules.  These  rules  are  reproduced  in  full  in  this document.  They  are  also  available  on  the  website  lorealfinance.com.  They  are  regularly  updated  by  the  Board  of Directors in order to take account of the changes in the laws and regulations, best corporate governance practices and its own  modus  operandi,  particularly  within  the  scope  of  the annual evaluation of its work.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors,  the  rules  it applies to its work, its modus operandi, and the work that it has carried  out  in  the  year,  evaluated  on  an  annual  basis  by  the Directors, as well as the decisions made, are described in more detail in sections 2.2. and 2.3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Activities of the Board Committees\n\nThe Board's debates and decisions are assisted by the work performed  by  its  Committees,  which  report  to  it  after  each of  their  meetings.  The  remits  of  each  Committee  are described  in  detail  in  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of Directors.  The  Board's  Committees  act  strictly  within  the framework  of  the  remits  given  to  them  by  the  Board.  They actively prepare for its work and make proposals but they do\n\nnot  have  any  decision-making  powers.

The members of the Audit Committee have the necessary financial and accounting skills due  to  their  professional  experience  and  their  good knowledge of the Group's accounting and financial procedures.\n\nIn addition to the specific skills of certain Committee members, the Committee is given regular updates on sustainability issues, particularly draft regulations. Since 2018, it has been responsible for monitoring issues relating to financial and nonfinancial information and monitoring risk management systems, including  CSR  risks.  As  part  of  the  transposition  of  the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Audit Committee's remit in this domain has been confirmed.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors attend meetings, except for discussions  on  items  that  concern  them.  The  Committee meets  at  least  twice  a  year  without  management  present, with the participation of the Statutory  Auditors.  The Committee did not deem it appropriate to call upon outside expert. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are not members of the Committee.\n\n## Changes for 2024\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors decided that Jacques Ripoll would  join  the  Audit  Committee  at  the  close  of  the  Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024 (1) .\n\n## 2023 main activities\n\n## Monitoring the process for preparation of financial information\n\n- \u00b7 Review of annual and interim results, including press releases and the balance sheet.

Appendix: Complete text of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors\n\nThese Rules are applicable to all present and future Directors, whether they are appointed by the General Meeting or by the employees,  and  are  intended  to  complement  the  legal, regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and  those  under  the  Articles of  Association  in  order  to  state  accurately  the  modus operandi of the Board of Directors and its committees, in the interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  principles  of corporate  governance  as  presented  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.  The  Internal  Rules  specify  the  modus  operandi  of  the Board,  in  the  interests  of  the  Company  and  of  all  its\n\n## PREAMBLE\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  ('the  Company')  is  a collegial  body  which  is  mandated  by  all  the  shareholders. It has  the  authority  given  to  it  by  law  to  act  in  all circumstances in the best interests of the Company.\n\nBy  exercising  its  legal  prerogatives,  the  Board  of  Directors ('the Board') fulfils the following main duties: it validates the Company's  strategic  orientations,  appoints  the  corporate officers  given  responsibility  for  managing  the  Company within  the  scope  of  this  strategy,  chooses  the  method of organisation  of  General  Management  (combination or  separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer),  oversees  management  and  ensures  the  quality of the financial and non-financial information provided to the shareholders and to the markets.\n\nThe organisation of the Board's work and its composition is adapted  to  the  specificities  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  is  in  line  with an  approach  of  constant  progress.  The  Board's  main responsibility  is  to  adopt  the  method  of  organisation  and the modus operandi which enable it to perform its duties to the best of its ability. Its organisation and modus operandi are described in these Internal Rules which it draws up, and which are published in full  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  website  and  in  the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Board's actions are carried out within the framework of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  The  Corporate  Governance Report provides more detail on the Board's composition and on  the  way  in  which  the  Board's  work  is  prepared  and organised, and explains, where applicable, the recommendations  that  have  not  been  adopted  in  light  of the Company's specificities.\n\nThese  Rules  apply  to  all  the  Directors,  both  current  and future, whether they are appointed by the Annual General Meeting or the employees, and are intended to complement the  legal,  regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and  those  under the Articles of Association in order to state accurately the modus  operandi  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its committees.\n\nshareholders,  and  those  of  its  Committees,  whose  members are Directors to whom it gives preparatory assignments for its work.\n\nIn  line  with  the  distribution  of  responsibility  for  sustainability issues  between  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee,  the  Board's  Internal  Rules  were updated  on  8  February  2024  to  allocate  the  responsibilities provided  for  by  the  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive (CSRD) to the remit of the Audit Committee. As was the  case  for  previous  versions,  the  Internal  Rules  are  made public in full in this paragraph.\n\n## 1. Remit and authority of the Board of Directors\n\n## 1.1. General powers of the Board\n\nThe  Board  defines  the  business  strategy  of  the  Company and  monitors  its  implementation,  in  accordance  with  its corporate interest, taking social and environmental challenges into consideration.\n\nSubject  to  the  powers  expressly  conferred  to  Annual General  Meetings  and  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose,  the  Board  deals  with  all  matters  regarding  the smooth  running  of  the  Company  and  settles  issues concerning the Company by virtue of its decisions. At any time  in  the  year,  the  Board  carries  out  the  controls  and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nThe  Board  ensures,  as  appropriate,  that  a  mechanism for the  prevention  and  detection  of  corruption  and influence-peddling is in place.\n\nThe  Board  also  ensures  that  the  executive  corporate officers  implement  a  policy  of  non-discrimination  and diversity  as  regards  the  balance  of  women  and  men  in management bodies.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report relays the Board's activity.\n\nThe  Board  prepares  for  and  convenes  Annual  General Meetings and sets the agenda. It puts the parent company and  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the  vote  and presents to the meeting its Management Report to which the Corporate Governance Report is appended.\n\nThe Board sets the remuneration of directors and corporate officers.  It  reports  on  its  policy  and  decisions  in  its Management  Report  and  in  the  Corporate  Governance Report. The Annual General Meeting is consulted every year on  the  components  of  remuneration  due  or  allocated  to each executive corporate officer for the past financial year. The  Board  is  a  collegial  body  which  is  legally  unable  to delegate its authority, except to the General Management in  those  cases  expressly  provided  for  by  law.  Within  the scope of its work, it may decide to set up Committees which do not have decision-making powers but have the task of providing  all  useful  information  for  the  discussions  and decisions which it is called upon to make. The Board decides on  the  composition  of  the  Committees  and  the  rules  with regard to their modus operandi.\n\nThe  Board  may  ask  one  or  more  of  its  members  or  third parties  to  carry  out  special  assignments  or  projects  aimed in particular at studying one of more specific topics.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2. Relations between General Management and the Board\n\n## 1.2.1. Forms of General Management\n\nGeneral Management of the Company is carried out, under the  responsibility  of  either  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) or by another  individual  with  the  position  of  Chief  Executive Officer.  Leaving  the  possibility  to  choose  between  the separation or combination of roles, French law does not give preference  to  any  form  and  gives  the  Board  authority  to choose  between  the  two  methods  of  organisation  of the General Management considering the specificities of the Company.\n\nWhether  the  General  Management  is  carried  out  by  a Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  a  Chief  Executive Officer,  the  Board  has  the  same  prerogatives.  It  may  in particular  take  all  specific  measures  aimed  at  ensuring  the continued balance of powers.\n\n## 1.2.2. Powers of General Management\n\nThe General Management, which may be carried out by the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  by  a  Chief Executive Officer, is vested with the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  It  must exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose subject to the powers expressly granted by French law  to  General  Shareholders'  Meetings  and  the  Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  has  the  possibility  to  provide  for  limitations  on the powers of the General Management. Thus, transactions which  may  materially  impact  the  scope  of  consolidation of  the  Company,  in  particular,  transactions  involving  an amount  in excess of \u20ac250,000,000  and  all  new transactions  which  are  outside  the  normal  course  of business for an amount in excess of \u20ac50,000,000, must be submitted to the Board. In any event, the Board of Directors must be informed of the conclusion and implementation of all transactions.\n\nThe  General  Management  represents  the  Company  in  its dealings with third parties.\n\nUpon a proposal by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board may  appoint  one  or  more  individuals  responsible  for assisting  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  will  hold  the corporate office of Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s).\n\n## 1.2.3. Duties of General Management\n\nWhatever  the  form  of  organisation  chosen  (Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Chief  Executive  Officer),  the General Management is required to provide each Director with  all  the  documents  and  information  required  to  carry out their duties.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  General  Management  provides  the Board  members  with  useful  information  in  connection  with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the Company if the importance or urgency of the information so  requires.  This  provision  of  ongoing  information  also includes  any  relevant  information  concerning  the  Company, and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports  containing financial analysis.\n\nThe  General  Management  gives  the  Board  and  its Committees  the  possibility  to  meet  with  the  senior managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  within  the  strict  framework  of  their remits  and  duties.  In  consultation  with  the  General Management,  the  Board  and  the  Committees  may  use external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board is informed, at the time of closing of the annual financial statements and the review of the interim financial statements  or  at  any  other  time  if  necessary,  of  the Company's financial position and cash position.\n\n## 2. Composition of the Board\n\n## 2.1. Directors\n\nThe Directors of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 provide their expertise and professional experience;\n- \u00b7 are  required  to  act  with  due  care  and  attention  and participate  actively  in  the  work  and  discussions  of the Board;\n- \u00b7 have complete freedom of judgement.\n\nThis  freedom  of  judgement  enables  them  in  particular  to participate, in total independence, in the decisions and work of the Board, and, where appropriate, of its Committees.\n\n## 2.1.1. Independence\n\nThe  Board  reviews  the  independence  of  each  of  its members  every  year,  after  obtaining  the  opinion  of  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  in  particular  in light of the independence criteria in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  taking  account  of  the  specific  needs  of  L'Or\u00e9al. The  findings  of  this  evaluation  are  reported  to  the shareholders and made available to the general public.\n\n## 2.1.2. Diversity\n\nThe Board considers the issue of the desirable balance of its composition  and  that  of  its  Committees,  notably  in  the representation  of  men  and  women,  nationalities  and diversity of skills. The objectives, terms and conditions, and results  of  its  policy  in  this  area  are  made  public  in  the Corporate Governance Report and included in the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.1.3. Terms of office\n\nThe length of the term of office of Directors is four years. However, the staggering of the terms of office is organised in order to avoid renewing too many Directors at once and favour renewing Directors harmoniously.\n\nIn  principle,  it  is  agreed  by  the  Board  members  that  all Directors will tender their resignation to the Board prior to the  Annual  General  Meeting  following  their  73rd  birthday and that they will no longer apply for renewal of their term of office if this rule does not enable them to perform their office for at least two years.\n\nIn any event, in accordance with French law and the Articles of Association, the total number of Directors who are over 70 years of age may not exceed one third of the Directors in office.",

Chairman of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors must elect a Chairman from among its members.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board organises and oversees the Board's work and reports thereon to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe  Chairman  oversees  the  work  of  the  Company's  bodies responsible for corporate governance and ensures, in  particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their duties. He may ask for the communication of any document or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote the values and image of the Company at all times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe  is  provided  with  the  material  resources  required  to perform his duties.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board takes care, particularly  in  the event  of  separation  of  roles,  to  develop  and  maintain  a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and the General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee  continuous, ongoing implementation by the General Management of the strategies defined by the Board.\n\n## 3. Rights and obligations of the Directors\n\n## 3.1. Knowledge of and compliance with regulatory texts, recommendations and obligations\n\nEach of the members of the Board declares that they have read the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company's Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 the  legal  and  regulatory  texts  that  govern  French 'soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes' (public limited companies) within the framework  of  the  functioning  of  a  Board  of  Directors and, in particular, the rules relating to:\n- \u00b7 the number of offices that may be held simultaneously;\n- \u00b7 the  agreements  and  transactions  concluded  between the Director and the Company;\n- \u00b7 the definition of the powers of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the  holding  and  use  of  inside  information,  which  are discussed in section 3.6.;\n- \u00b7 the recommendations defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 and the provisions of these Rules.\n\n## 3.2. Respect for the interests of the Company\n\nThe  Directors  are  required  to  act  in  all  circumstances  in  the interest of the Company and all its shareholders.\n\nThe  Directors  are  obliged  to  notify  the  Board  of  any situation  that  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if such  conflict  is  only  potential,  and  must  refrain  from participating in the corresponding deliberations.\n\nThe  Directors  must  inform  the  Board  every  year  of  the offices  and  positions  they  hold  in  other  companies  and  of any conflicts of interest, even if they are only potential, that they  have  identified  (see  Annual  Report  on  independence under Article 4.4).\n\nThe Board furthermore discusses every year the assessment of  whether  or  not  the  business  relationships  maintained between  the  companies  in  which  the  Directors  hold  their offices  and  the  Company  are  significant.  It  reports  on  its evaluation in the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 3.3. Obligations of due diligence and provision of information\n\nThe Director must devote the necessary time and attention to his/her duties.\n\nHe/she must limit the number of offices held so as to ensure his/her availability.\n\nA  Director  must  not  hold  more  than  four  other  terms  of office  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign companies. The Director concerned is given enough time to bring his/her situation into compliance with this rule, where required.\n\nThe  Director  must  keep  the  Board  informed  of  the  terms of office held  in other  companies,  including  his/her participation  on  the  Board  Committees  of  such  French or foreign companies.\n\nA corporate officer must not hold more than two offices as Director  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign  companies.  The  Director  must  ask  for  the  Board's opinion before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company.\n\nEach Board member undertakes to be diligent:\n\n- \u00b7 by  attending  all  Board  meetings,  where  necessary  by means of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, except in the case of a major impediment;\n- \u00b7 by attending, whenever possible, all General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 by  attending  the  meetings  of  the  Board  Committees of which he/she is a member.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  gives  shareholders  all useful information on the Directors' individual participation in these sessions and meetings.\n\nIn connection with decisions to be made, the Director must ensure that he/she has all the information he/she considers essential for the smooth conduct of the work of the Board or the Committees. If this information is not made available to him/her, or he/she considers that it has not been made available,  he/she  must  request  such  information  from  the Chairman of the Board who is required to ensure that the Directors are in a position to perform their duties.\n\n## 3.4. Learning for Directors\n\nAll  the  Directors,  and  in  particular  those  representing  the employees, may benefit, on their appointment or throughout their directorship, from the appropriate learning programmes for the exercise of the office.\n\nThese learning programmes are organised and proposed by the Company and are provided at its expense.",

Obligation of reserve and confidentiality\n\nThe  Directors  undertake  not  to  express  themselves individually  other  than  in  the  internal  deliberations  of  the Board on questions raised at Board meetings.\n\nOutside the Company, only collegial expression is possible, particularly in the form of releases intended to provide the markets with information.\n\nWith  regard  to  information  not  in  the  public  domain  to which the Director has access as a result of his duties, the Director  must  consider  him/herself  to  be  bound  by  strict professional confidentiality, which is more demanding than the  mere  legal  obligation  of  discretion.  This  obligation applies  to  all  persons  called  on  to  attend  Board  meetings, and covers all  information  of  a  confidential  nature  and  all information  presented  as  confidential  by  the  Chairman  of the Board.\n\nBeyond this legal obligation and to ensure the quality of the discussions  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all  the  information given  to  Board  members  and  the  opinions  they  express must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nThis  obligation  applies  to  any  person  invited  to  attend  a Board meeting.\n\n## 3.6. Stock market ethics\n\n## 3.6.1. Principles\n\nThe  Company  has  put  in  place  a  'Stock  Market  Code  of Ethics'  that  is  regularly  updated,  in  particular  to  take  into account changes in the regulations in force. This Code was updated  following  the  applicability,  as  from  3  July  2016, of  European  Regulation  (EU)  No.  596/2014  on  market abuse  ('Market  Abuse  Regulation').  The  Board  members comply with the Principles of Stock Market Ethics 'related to inside information' provided for by this code.\n\nInside information must only be used by the Director in the exercise of his office. Such information must in no case be communicated to a third party other than in the exercise of the  tenure  as  Director,  and  for  any  other  purpose  or  any other activity than those for which it is held.\n\nIt  is  the  duty  of  all  Directors  to  refrain  from  trading  in, having others trade in, or enabling others (including through recommendations  or  encouragements)  to  trade  in  the securities of the Company on the basis of this information, until such time as the information has been made public.\n\nIt is the  personal  responsibility  of  each  Director  to determine  whether  the  information  he/she  holds  is  inside information or not, and accordingly whether he/she may or may  not  use  or  transmit  any  of  the  information,  and whether he/she may or may not trade or have others trade in the Company's securities.\n\n## 3.6.2. Abstention periods\n\nDuring  the  period  preceding  the  publication  of  any  inside information to which Directors have access, in their capacity of insiders, the members of the Board must by law refrain from all trading in the Company's securities.\n\nFurthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  Market  Abuse Regulation  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French financial markets authority (AMF), they are prohibited from trading in the Company's shares over the following periods:\n\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  30  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication of the press release on the annual and halfyear results;\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  15  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication  of  the  press  release  on  quarterly  financial information.\n\nThe Directors are only authorised to trade in L'Or\u00e9al shares on the day after publishing the press release.\n\n## 3.6.3. Insider trading\n\nThe  Director  has  been  informed  of  the  provisions  in  force relating to the holding of inside information, insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of inside information: Articles  465-1  et  seq.,  L.  621-14  and  L.  621-15,  III  c  of  the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 7 et seq. of the Market Abuse Regulation.\n\n## 3.6.4. Obligation to declare trading in the securities of the Company\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations, the Directors and closely associated persons, as defined by Article 3.1.26 of the Market Abuse Regulation, must inform the AMF (1) of all acquisitions,  sales,  subscriptions  or  trades  of  the Company's  shares  and  transactions  involving  related instruments where the cumulative amount  of  such transactions  is  higher  than  \u20ac20,000  for  the  current calendar year.\n\nThe Directors and closely  associated  persons  must  submit their declarations to the AMF by email within three trading days following completion of the transaction.\n\nThese individuals must simultaneously provide a copy of this declaration  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Company's  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe declarations are then posted on the AMF's website and are  mentioned  in  an  annual  summary  set  out  in  the Company's Management Report.\n\n## 3.6.5. Appointment of an Internal Stock Market Ethics Advisor\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  appointed  an  'Internal  Stock  Market  Ethics Advisor', who is responsible for assisting, in confidence, any person who so requests, with the analysis and assessment of  their  situation,  without  prejudice  to  the  principle  of personal accountability.",

Holding of a minimum number of shares\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and independently  of  any  obligation  to  hold  shares  under  the Articles  of  Association,  the  Directors  must  personally  be shareholders of the Company and hold a significant number of shares.\n\nEach  Director  shall  own  at  least  250  shares  in  the Company: at least 125 shares on the date of his/her election by  the  Annual  General  Meeting,  and  the  balance  no  later than 24 months after this election.\n\nThe decision as to whether the shares held by the Director should  be  registered  or  deposited,  in  full  or  in  part,  is  the responsibility of the Director.\n\nThis  stock  ownership  obligation  is  not  applicable  to  the Directors representing the employees.\n\n## 4. Modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 4.1. Convening the Board\n\nThe  Board  is  convened  by  any  appropriate  means.  Notices convening a meeting may be transmitted by the Secretary of the Board of Directors. They are sent in writing at least eight days prior to each meeting, except in particular circumstances. The notices specify the venue of the meeting, which may be the headquarters or any other venue.\n\nAll the  documents  that  are  necessary  to  inform  the Directors  about  the  agenda  and  about  any  questions submitted  to  the  Board  for  review  are  enclosed  with  the notice convening the meeting or are sent or provided to them within a reasonable period of time, prior to the meeting.\n\nThese  documents  may  be  provided  to  them  on  a  secure digital platform, within a reasonable period of time prior to the  meeting.  They  may  in  exceptional  cases  be  provided at the meeting.\n\n## 4.2. Board meetings and method of participation\n\nThe Board meets as often as required in the best interest of the Company, and at least five times per year.\n\nThe dates of the Board meetings for the following year are set  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  summer,  except  in the case of Extraordinary Meetings.\n\nThe frequency and length of Board meetings must be such that they allow for an in-depth review and discussion of the matters  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  remits  of  the Committees.\n\nThe  Directors  meet  once  a  year  without  the  presence  of the executive corporate officer, the Directors representing the employees or any other Group employee.\n\nIn accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions and with  Article  9  section  2  of  the  Articles  of  Association, Directors  who  take  part  in  Board  meetings  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities are deemed to  be  present  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  quorum and the majority.\n\nThese  means  must  guarantee  simultaneous,  continuous retransmission of the debates.\n\nHowever, these means of participation are excluded when the Board so decides and in any event when it decides with regard  to  closing  of  the  Company's  parent  company  and consolidated financial statements and on the preparation of the Management Report.\n\nA  Director  who  participates  by  means  of  videoconference or  teletransmission  must  ensure  that  the  confidentiality  of the debates is preserved.\n\nThe attendance register mentions the Board members who attend  Board  meetings  by  means  of  videoconference  or telecommunication  facilities,  with  the  Secretary  of  the meeting having the task of initialling the register for them.\n\nThe  Board  may  take  the  following  decisions  by  written consultation  with  the  Directors,  electronically  if  necessary: (i) co-optation of Directors, (ii) authorisations related to the sureties, endorsements and warranties referred to in Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, (iii) amendments to the Articles of Association to ensure compliance with the legislative  and  regulatory  provisions,  when  the  Annual General  Meeting  has  approved  a  delegation  for  this purpose, (iv) the convening of the Annual General Meeting and (v) decisions to transfer the registered office within the same department.\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Board Secretary will  send  the  consultation  to  each  Director,  with an  indication  of  the  appropriate  deadline  by  which  to respond,  as  determined  by  the  Chairman  based  on  the decision  to  be  taken,  the  urgency  or  the  time  required  to reflect on the vote to be made. The document provided for this  purpose  details  the  procedures  of  the  consultation, its purpose,  a  presentation  and  the  reasons  for  the proposed  decision,  as  well  as  the  draft  deliberation. Directors  who  have  not  responded  by  the  end  of  the specified deadline will not be considered to form part of the quorum for the purposes of taking the decisions set out in the consultation, unless the Chairman has extended the said deadline.  The  Secretary  of  the  Board  counts  the  votes  of the  Directors  on  the  proposed  resolution  and  informs  the Board of the result of the vote.\n\n## 4.3. Minutes of Board meetings\n\nMinutes are prepared for each Board meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting mention the use of videoconference  or  telecommunication  facilities  and  the name of each person who participated in the Board by such means.  The  minutes  also  indicate  whether  any  technical incidents  occurred  during  a  meeting  held  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, and if such incidents disrupted the course of the meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the deliberations include a summary of the debates  and  specify  the  decisions  that  were  made.  They mention the questions raised or the reservations expressed by participants.\n\nThe  draft  minutes  of  the  last  Board  meeting  are  sent  or given to all the Directors at the latest on the date when the next meeting is convened.\n\nThe  Secretary  of  the  Board  is  empowered  to  issue  and certify copies or extracts of the minutes of Board meetings.\n\nDecisions taken by means of written consultation with the Directors are recorded in minutes that are stored under the same conditions  as  other  decisions  taken  by  the  Board  of Directors.",

He/she assists the Chairman in organising the Board's work and in particular with regard to the definition of the annual work programme and the dates of Board meetings.\n\nWith  the  support  of  the  General  Management,  he/she ensures the quality and production, sufficiently in advance, of the documents and drafts put to the vote of the Board at its meetings.\n\nHe/she  prepares  the  draft  minutes  of  Board  meetings, which are submitted for the Board's approval.\n\nHe/she  is  responsible  for  the  secure  IT  platform  made available to the Directors.\n\nHe/she  monitors  on  an  ongoing  basis  changes  in  the regulations and reflections in the marketplace with regard to the corporate governance of listed companies.\n\nThe  Secretary  organises,  together  with  the  Chairman,  the annual  evaluation  of  the  Board's  work  and  receives  the annual  reports  on  independence  by  each  Director  (see Article 3.2).\n\nEvery Director may consult the Board Secretary at any time with regard to the scope of the rights and obligations linked to his/her office.\n\n## 4.5. Annual evaluation\n\n## of the modus operandi of the Board\n\nEvery year, the Board carries out an evaluation of its ability to respond to the expectations of shareholders by reviewing its composition, its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nAt  its  last  meeting  for  the  year  and  on  the  basis  of  a summary  of  the  interviews  that  are  previously  organised and conducted with each Director, based on a guide which includes  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the  AFEPMEDEF  Code,  the  Board  discusses  points  of  view  and opinions expressed. It draws the conclusions from this with the aim of improving the conditions for the preparation and organisation of its work and that of its Committees.\n\nThe results of the evaluation, with the avenues of progress that remain open, are passed on to the shareholders in the Annual  Report  and  at  the  time  of  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\n## 5. Board Committees\n\nWhen  the  Board  sets  up  Committees,  it  appoints  the members of these Committees and determines their duties and responsibilities.\n\nThese Committees act within the remit granted to them by the  Board  and  therefore  have  no  decision-making  power. The Committees may not at any time take over the powers of the General Management as set out in chapter 1.2.2. of these Rules.\n\nThe Committee members are Directors. They are appointed by  the  Board  in  person  and  may  not  be  represented. All  Board  members  have  the  necessary  qualifications  due to  their  professional  experience.  They  actively  take  part  in Committee meetings with complete freedom of judgement and in the interest of the Company.\n\nThe task of secretary of each Committee is carried out by a  person  appointed  in  agreement  with  the  Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Committee. It may also be performed by the Secretary of the Board.\n\nEach  Committee  defines  the  frequency  of  its  meetings. These meetings are held at the Company's headquarters or at  any  other  place  decided  by  the  Chairman/Chairwoman of the Committee.\n\nThe  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  each  Committee  prepares the agenda for each meeting.\n\nThe  Committees  may  make  contact,  in  the  exercise  of  their duties, with the Company's main senior managers, in agreement with  the  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  the  Board  and  after informing  the  General  Management  and  will  report  on  such contacts to the Board.\n\nThe Board may entrust a Committee Chair, or one or more of its members, with a special assignment or project to carry out  specific  research  or  study  future  possibilities.  The designated  individual  will  report  on  this  work  to  the Committee  concerned  such  that  the  Committee  may deliberate  on  this  work  and  in  turn  report  thereon  to  the Board.\n\nFor  each  Committee  meeting,  its  members  may  decide  to invite any other person of their choice to attend as needs be and on an advisory basis, when  they  consider it appropriate.\n\nIn its field of competence, each Committee makes proposals and recommendations and expresses opinions as the case may be.

This  reference remuneration is revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse) .  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career, including the years spent as a corporate officer.\n\nInformation  on  the  benefits  that  could  be  owed  under  the suspended employment contract are discussed in subsection 2.4.3. 'Termination indemnities and supplementary pension scheme applicable to corporate officers'.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is also considered in the same way as a senior manager during the term of their corporate office,  which  allows  them  to  continue  to  benefit  from  the additional  social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular,  from the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme,  and  the  employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n## Remuneration that is consistent with the remuneration of the Company's senior managers\n\nThe remuneration policy for the executive corporate officer is in  line,  where  applicable,  with  the  policy  which  was  applied to them as senior managers.\n\nTheir level of remuneration as an executive corporate officer is set on the basis of the level of responsibilities they exercised in the company at the time of their appointment.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  based  on  the  same  foundations and  instruments  as  those  applied  to  the  Company's  senior managers.  The  remuneration  principles  are  therefore  stable and durable.\n\nThe Board of Directors is informed every year of the Group's Human  Resources  policy.  It  is  in  a  position  to  verify  the consistency  between  the  remuneration  of  the  executive corporate  officer  and  the  procedures  in  place,  particularly for  the  members  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee, on  the  basis  of  the  work  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\n## Competitive remuneration in comparison to a coherent and stable reference panel\n\nThe remuneration of the executive corporate officer must be competitive in order to attract, motivate and retain the best talents in the Company's top positions.\n\nThis  remuneration  is  assessed  overall,  namely  by  taking  into account all the components that make it up.\n\nTo  assess  the  competitiveness  of  this  remuneration,  a coherent  and  stable  reference  panel  is  defined  with  the assistance of an external consulting firm.\n\nThe  panel  consists  of  French  and  international  companies that have leading global positions. These companies operate on  similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector,  direct competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider  everyday consumer  goods  market,  as  regards  all  or  part  of  their business activities.\n\nThis  panel  is  composed  of  the  remuneration  of  executives in the following companies:\n\n| Colgate  Palmolive   | Kimberly  Clark   | Reckitt  Benckiser   | Beiersdorf   | Danone   |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------|\n| GSK                  | Henkel            | LVMH                 | Unilever     | Danone   |\n| Est\u00e9e  Lauder        | Kenvue            | Procter  & Gamble    | Kering       | Danone   |\n\nThis panel is re-examined every year by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee in order to check its relevance. It  may  evolve,  particularly  to  take  into  account  the  changes in  the  structure  or  business  activities  of  selected  companies, on the basis of the proposals made by the external advisory firm.\n\n## Remuneration that is aligned to the Company's social interest and directly linked to the Company's strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors has aligned the remuneration policy for an executive corporate officer in the interests of the Company, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and development of  the  Company,  taking  into  consideration  the  social  and environmental challenges of its business activity and the sense of purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) of L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## a) Close links with strategy\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  applied  to  the  executive  corporate officer is directly linked to the Group's strategy. It supports its development model. It promotes harmonious, regular, durable growth, both over the short and long term. Indeed, the Board of Directors strives constantly to incite the General Management both to maximise performance for each financial year and to ensure that it is repeated and regular year-on-year. This  is  in  line  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  stated  objective  of  economic  and societal excellence.",

        "page_content": "## b) Performance targets that are directly correlated with those of the Company and create value\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  chooses  to  correlate  the  executive corporate officer's performance directly with the Company's performance  by  using  the  same  performance  indicators, financial indicators in particular.\n\nThe  choice  of  correlating  the  performance  criteria  for  the executive corporate officer's remuneration with the Company's  performance  indicators,  particularly  those  of  a financial  nature,  is  the  guarantee  of  a  clear  and  relevant remuneration policy.\n\nThese  criteria  make  it  possible  to  assess  L'Or\u00e9al's  intrinsic performance,  namely  its  progress  year-on-year  via  internal performance  indicators  and  also  its  relative  performance as  compared  to  its  market  and  its  competitors  via  external growth indicators.\n\nThe  objectives  adopted  generate  long-term  value  creation. In particular,  the  choice  of  varied  operational  financial criteria  aims  at  encouraging  durable,  balanced  growth. Overall long-term performance results from the convergence of these criteria.\n\nThese objectives must also be an incentive for the executive corporate  officer  to  adapt  the  Group's  strategy  to  the profound  transformations  in  the  world  of  beauty,  and  the digital revolution in particular.\n\n## c) Preponderant portion of the remuneration subject to performance conditions\n\nThe executive  corporate  officer's  remuneration  must  include a  predominant  portion  subject  to  performance  conditions, with annual and multi-annual assessment periods adapted to the time horizon of each of these objectives.\n\n## Remuneration that is directly in line with the Group's ambitious social, societal and environmental commitments\n\nThe remuneration must be designed to favour a regular and sustainable development, in line with the Group's commitments  with  regard  to  ethics,  and  respectful  of  the environment  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al  operates.  In  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al announced its Corporate Social Responsibility vision by 2030 in the context of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, which has a set of objectives for climate, biodiversity, water and the use of natural resources.\n\nThe social and societal commitment is just as important since no  environmental  transition  is  possible  without  an  inclusive society. The  annual  variable  portion  of  the  executive corporate officer's remuneration, and their long-term remuneration, includes non-financial criteria related to L'Or\u00e9al's sense of purpose and the commitments made by the Group,  particularly  in  the  context  of  its  corporate  social, societal and environmental responsibility programmes.\n\nThese criteria will be assessed year-on-year with a long-term perspective.\n\n## Remuneration that creates medium and long-term value for the shareholders\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must be linked to  the  variation  over  the  medium-to  long-term  in  the Company's intrinsic value and share performance. A  significant  portion  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration  thus  consists of performance  shares,  a significant  percentage  of  which  is  retained  until  the  end  of his/her corporate office, with the undertaking not to carry out risk hedging transactions.\n\nThis  leads  to  alignment  with  the  shareholders'  interests, understood as long-term value creation.\n\n## B/ Policy on fixed and variable compensation and granting of performance shares to the executive corporate officer\n\n## The key for allocating target annual remuneration\n\nThe  annual  remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate  officer consists of a fixed compensation,  an  annual  variable remuneration and the granting of performance shares.\n\nIt does not include any exceptional components.\n\nThe Board of Directors adopts the various components of this remuneration,  paying  attention  to  the  necessary  balance between each of them.\n\nEach component  of the target annual remuneration corresponds  to  a  well-defined  and  clearly  substantiated objective.\n\nThe  various  components  of  annual  remuneration  form  a balanced whole with a breakdown that is approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  fixed  remuneration  and  target  annual variable remuneration (1) ;\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  annual  remuneration  and  long-term remuneration (performance shares) (2) ;\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  cash  remuneration  and  share-based remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 75/25  between  remuneration  subject  to  performance conditions  and  remuneration  not  subject  to  performance conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

See below.\n- (2) Long-term remuneration (performance shares) may not exceed 60% of annual remuneration. See below.\n\nN.B.: the employer's contributions to the additional social protection plans are to be added to the above.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed compensation must reflect the responsibilities of the executive  corporate  officer,  his/her  level  of  experience  and skills.\n\nIt  has  remained  stable  for  several  years  and  may  be  reexamined  at  the  time  of  renewal  of  the  term  of  office.  It serves  as  a  basis  to  determine  the  maximum  percentage  of the target annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nThe  target  annual  variable  remuneration  may  amount  to  a maximum of 100% of the fixed compensation.\n\nThe  annual  variable  remuneration  may  exceed  100%  of the  fixed  compensation  and  up  to  a  maximum  of  120% of  this  remuneration  in  order  to  be  able  to  remunerate outperformance.  This  outperformance  is  assessed  on  a criterion-by-criterion basis.\n\nThe  aim  is  not  to  encourage  inappropriate  and  excessive  risk taking.  For  this  purpose,  the  annual  variable  remuneration remains reasonable in comparison with the fixed portion.\n\nThe variable remuneration is designed to align the executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  with  the  Group's  annual performance  and  to  promote  the  implementation  of  its strategy year after year.\n\nThe  variable  remuneration  is  based  on  precise  performance appraisal  criteria  determined  at  the  beginning  of  the  year by the Board of Directors.\n\nThese criteria are financial, non-financial and qualitative.\n\nThe  financial  and  non-financial  criteria  are  simple  and quantifiable.  They  represent  a  predominant  portion  of  the annual variable remuneration. A limit is set on the qualitative portion.\n\nThe weighting of each of the criteria and the objectives to be met  are  set  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  in  question  and communicated to the executive corporate officer.\n\nThese criteria are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 for 60% of the annual variable remuneration:\n- \u00b7 financial  criteria  directly  correlated  with  the  Company's performance indicators:\n- - evolution  in  comparable  sales  as  compared  to  the budget (15%);\n- - evolution  in  market  share  compared  to  that  of  key competitors (15%);\n- - evolution  in  operating  profit  as  compared  to  the budget (10%);\n- - evolution in net earnings per share as compared to the budget (10%); and\n- - evolution in cash flow as compared to the budget (10%).\n\n## \u00b7 for 40% of the annual variable remuneration:\n\n- \u00b7 non-financial criteria, linked in particular to:\n- - the progress of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, which combines L'Or\u00e9al's commitments to sustainability for 2030 (10%),\n- - the  implementation  of  the  Human  Resources  policy with  special  attention  to  the  development  of  gender balance in the management bodies (7.5%), and\n- - the digital development policy (7.5%),\n- \u00b7 qualitative criteria (15%).\n\nThe quantifiable, financial (60%) and non-financial (25%) criteria account for 85% of annual variable remuneration.",

Consequently,  the  final  vesting  of  the  shares  is  subject  to performance  conditions  which  are  recorded  at  the  end  of a vesting period of four years from the grant date.\n\nThe  value  of  these  shares,  estimated  at  the  grant  date according  to  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation  of  the consolidated  financial  statements,  represents  approximately 50% of the executive corporate officer's annual remuneration and may not exceed 60%.\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves the possibility to decide on an additional grant if a particular event justifies it. This potential grant to the executive corporate officer, duly documented by the Board of Directors, may not exceed a total annual ceiling (taking into account any grants already awarded in the year) of 5% of the total number of free shares granted during that same financial year.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is required to retain 50% of the free  shares  finally  vested  to  him  or  her  at  the  end  of  the vesting period, in registered form, until the termination of his or her duties, following a review of the performance conditions.\n\nThe executive corporate officer makes a formal undertaking not to enter into any risk hedging transactions with regard to the  performance  shares,  until  the  end  of  the  holding  period set by the Board of Directors.\n\nAn  executive corporate officer may  not  be  granted performance shares at the time of his or her departure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are exacting but remain a source of motivation for the beneficiaries.\n\nThe  shares  are  only  finally  vested  at  the  end  of  a  4-year period,  allowing  sufficient  time  to  be  able  to  assess  the performance achieved over three full financial years.\n\nDETAILS OF WEIGHTING OF CRITERIA FOR GRANTING PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conditional vesting thresholds\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to net sales, in order for all the free shares granted to be finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al must outperform the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors. Below this  level,  the  number  of  finally  vested  shares  is  in  decline.  If  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  growth  in  net  sales  is  lower  than  the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors, no shares will be finally vested under this criterion.\n\nPursuant  to  the  criterion  related  to  operating  profit, a  level  of  growth,  defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for confidentiality reasons, must be met or exceeded in order for all free shares granted to be finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period. Below this level, the number of finally vested shares is in decline. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nWith regard to the criterion of fulfilling commitments made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme , in order for all the free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  certain  average  level  of achievement of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments, defined by the Board and made public, must be reached over the vesting period. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest if the average of the results for the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments falls below the minimum level defined by the Board and made public.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to gender balance in strategic positions , in order for all the free shares granted to be finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, the average representation of one of the sexes must account for at least 40% of employees in strategic positions. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThe results recorded each year to determine the levels of performance achieved are published in chapter 7 .",

These arrangements, which are strictly limited to professional use, are not benefits in kind.\n\n## \u00b7 Additional social protection schemes\n\nThe executive corporate officer continues to be treated in the same  way  as  a  senior  manager  during  the  term  of  his corporate office which allows him to continue to benefit from the  additional  social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular, the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme,  and  the  employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n## Illustration of the compensation policy in financial year 2024: Components of remuneration attributable to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe structure of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' remuneration is in line with the principles developed in subparagraph 2.4.1.2.1. of the remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  executive  corporate officer, and forms a balanced whole with a breakdown that is approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  fixed  remuneration  and  target  annual variable remuneration;\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  annual  remuneration  and  long-term remuneration (performance shares);\n- \u00b7 50/50  between  cash  remuneration  and  share-based remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 75/25  between  remuneration  subject  to  performance conditions  and  remuneration  not  subject  to  performance conditions.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus'  annual  variable  remuneration  may exceed 100% of his fixed compensation and up to a maximum of  120%  in  order  to  be  able  to  remunerate  outperformance. This  outperformance  will  be  assessed  on  a  criterion-bycriterion basis.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  be  called  upon  to  decide  on a  granting  of  performance  shares  in  2024  in  accordance with  the  remuneration  policy  submitted  for  the  approval  of the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount of the pension resulting  from  the  employer's  contributions  for  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme  will  be deducted  from  the  pension  due  in  respect  of  the  defined  benefit  pension  in  accordance  with  the |\n\n## 2.4.1.2.2. Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board who does not assume the office of Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Fixed annual remuneration only\n\nThe Board of Directors, in accordance with the recommendation  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  (Article  26.2), is proposing to the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024 that  the  exercise  of  the  office  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  without  assuming  the  office  of  Chief  Executive Officer,  would  be  remunerated  only  by  fixed  remuneration, excluding  any  variable  remuneration,  grant  of  performance shares  and  any  indemnity  related  to  departure  or  any consideration for a non-compete agreement.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  decided  that  the  tenure  as Director  held  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  would  not  be remunerated.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  will  benefit  from  the  necessary material resources for the performance of his office such as, for  example,  the  provision  of  a  car  with  a  driver.  These arrangements,  which  are  strictly  limited  to  professional  use, are not benefits in kind.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  will  benefit  from  the  same employee  benefit  scheme  as  the  senior  managers  of  the Company.\n\n## Principles for determining the fixed annual remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is determined based on the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 goals of L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors for the performance of the Chairman of the Board of Directors' legal duties not assuming the office of Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 experience,  expertise  and  reputation  of  the  Chairman  in Corporate Governance and Sustainable Governance;\n- \u00b7 specific  duties  assigned  to  the  Chairman  by  the  Board  of Directors;\n- \u00b7 competitiveness and level of the remuneration compared to that of a relevant reference panel put together by the firm Mercer.\n\n## Application to Mr Jean-Paul Agon\n\nThree years after the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were separated, the Board noted that Mr Jean-Paul Agon had successfully led the handover of senior management  responsibilities,  which  included  providing  Mr Nicolas Hieronimus with his complete  support  in his interactions  with  the  Board  of  Directors,  in  keeping  with  the extensive  duties  entrusted  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe Human Resources and Remuneration Committee recommended that the Board consider the end of this transition period by adjusting Mr Jean-Paul Agon's remuneration.\n\nThe Board of Directors has taken into account Mr Jean-Paul Agon's  full  commitment  to  serving  the  governance  of  the Company  and  performing  the  specific  duties  set  out  in paragraph 2.1.2.3. The Board is fully aware of the challenges of  sustainable  Governance,  notably  in  light  of  European legislative initiatives and  the  growing  expectations  of authorities and stakeholders.\n\nIt  remains  essential  for  the  Board  to  count  on  a  committed, experienced  Chairman  with  in-depth  knowledge  of  the business,  its  environment  and  its  strategic  challenges,  and who  is  recognised  for  his  involvement  in  governance  issues and stakeholder relations.\n\nThe  Board  is  satisfied  that  the  fixed  remuneration  is competitive  by  comparison  with  an  international  reference panel  that  was  defined  with  the  assistance  of  an  external independent  consultancy  firm,  Mercer,  by  pegging  it  higher than  the  median  remuneration  paid  to  the  Chairs  of  the Boards of Directors of 16 international benchmark companies.\n\nConsequently,  the  Board  of  Directors  proposes  that  the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024 should change the fixed annual compensation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors,  to  \u20ac950,000  from  1  May  2024, instead of his previous compensation of \u20ac1,600,000.",

Decision-making, review and implementation process for the remuneration of corporate officers\n\nRemuneration  is  established  in  such  a  way  as  to  guarantee the due and proper application of the policy and rules set by the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Board  relies  on  the  work  and recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, composed of six Directors, 60% of whom  are  independent  Directors,  including  its  Chairwoman, and  one  member  of  whom  is  a  Director  representing  the employees (1) .  The  corporate  officer  is  not  a  member  of  the Committee.  The  Committee's  recommendations  are  made taking into account the studies carried out at its request by an independent consulting firm.\n\nThe Committee met four times in 2023 and its work is detailed in subsection 2.3.3. Activities of the Board Committees\n\nThe Committee has the necessary information to prepare its recommendations  and  more  particularly  to  assess  the performance of the corporate officer  in  light  of  the  Group's short and long-term objectives.\n\nThe purpose of this organisation and this process is to prevent any conflicts of interest.\n\n## The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee uses the studies conducted by an independent consulting firm\n\nThese  studies  are  based  on  an  international  panel  of  world leaders,  which  serves  as  a  reference  for  the  comparative remuneration studies.\n\n## Executive corporate officer\n\nThis panel is made up of French and international companies that  hold  the  position  of  global  leader.  These  companies operate on similar markets and are, in the cosmetics sector, direct  competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider everyday  consumer  goods  market,  as  regards  all  or  part  of their business activities.\n\nThe  panel  applicable  for  2023  comprised  Directors  of  the following 13 companies:\n\n## PANEL  SELECTED  FOR  ANALYSIS  OF  THE  POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n| Beiersdorf   | Colgate  Palmolive   | Danone            | Est\u00e9e Lauder       |\n|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| GSK          | Henkel               | Kenvue            | Kimberly Clark     |\n| Kering       | LVMH                 | Procter  & Gamble | Reckitt  Benckiser |\n| Unilever     |                      |                   |                    |\n\nIt  is  used  to  assess  the  competitiveness  of  the  executive corporate officer's total remuneration. This panel reports an average  remuneration  of  \u20ac10,242,500  and  a  median remuneration of \u20ac7,986,500. In terms of market capitalisation, L'Or\u00e9al is above the third quartile of companies on this panel.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  Company's  remuneration  policy, specifically  that  in  place  for  senior  management  executives, aims to position their remuneration between the median and the third quartile. The studies conducted with the independent consulting firm also enable the Committee to measure:\n\n- \u00b7 the competitiveness of the overall remuneration  in comparison to this benchmark panel;\n- \u00b7 the  relevance  over  time  of  the  overall  remuneration structure and the objectives assigned to him/her;\n- \u00b7 the  comparative  results  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  light  of  the  criteria adopted  by  the  Group  to  assess  the  executive  corporate officer's performance; and\n- \u00b7 the link between the executive corporate officer's remuneration and his or her performance.\n\n## Non-executive corporate officer\n\nTo determine the positioning of the Chairman's remuneration, a  panel  was  defined  with  the  help  of  an  independent consultancy firm. It is composed of 16 international companies, selected  on  the  basis  of  governance,  industry,  size  and nationality.",

The Directors are therefore able to verify the consistency between the remuneration of  the  executive  corporate  officer  and  the  remuneration  and employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer  also regularly explains the policy and the actions taken in this field.\n\n2  members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  are  members  of  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee  at  which  the  actions  taken  with  regard  to  the programmes concerning the Group's social and environmental responsibility are discussed\n\nThis information contributes to the assessment  of  the non-financial  and  qualitative  portion  of  the  annual  variable remuneration.\n\nThe Committee can also carry out a more in-depth evaluation of the Company's performance by contacting the Company's main  senior  managers,  after  having  informed  the  General Management.\n\nThis  information  enriches  their  vision  of  the  strategy  and performances  of  the  Company  and  its  executive  corporate officer.\n\nRecommendations are made on these bases to the Board of Directors,  which  then  makes  its  decisions  on  the  executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  collectively,  in  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  work  of  the  Committee  on  the remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate  officer  is  shown  in the chart below.\n\n## The Committee examines the expectations of investors and proxy advisors, and the rules and recommendations of the regulatory authorities\n\nThe Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee carefully  analyses  the  law  and  reports  concerning  executive remuneration, notably the French financial markets authority's  (AMF)  report  on  corporate  governance  and  the remuneration  of  executives  of  listed  companies,  and  the report of the High Committee on Corporate Governance.\n\nIt  is  mindful  of  the  observations  and  requests  of  investors  and strives to accommodate them while preserving consistency in the remuneration policy adopted  by  the Board and subject to constraints relating to the confidentiality of certain information.\n\n## Adjustment of the remuneration policy in the event of exceptional circumstances\n\nIn accordance  with  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors can, in the event of exceptional  circumstances,  make  an  exception  from  the application  of  the  remuneration  policy,  provided  that  the exemption  applied  is  temporary  and  compliant  with  the company's  interest  and  necessary  to  ensure  the  company's continuity  or  viability.  In  such  case,  the  Board  of  Directors would  be  able  to  grant  an  element  of  remuneration  not provided for in the remuneration policy previously approved by the  Annual  General  Meeting,  but  necessary  in  view  of  these exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also, within the framework of its discretionary power,  adapt  the  remuneration  policy  if unforeseeable  or  exceptional  circumstances  so  justify.  Thus, for example, the recruitment of a new corporate officer under unforeseen conditions might require the temporary adaptation  of  some  existing  remuneration  elements  or  the proposal  of  new  remuneration  elements.  In  this  case, the Board  of  Directors  would  take  into  account  the experience,  expertise  and  remuneration  of  the  executive concerned in order to propose exceptional remuneration that could not exceed the amount of the benefits he or she would have had to relinquish by leaving his or her previous role.\n\nIt  might  also  be  necessary  to  amend,  subject  to  compliance with  the  caps  determined  in  the  remuneration  policy,  the performance  conditions  governing  the  acquisition  of  all  or some  of  the  existing  remuneration  elements  in  the  event  of exceptional circumstances resulting from a significant change in the Group's scope following a merger or sale, the acquisition or  creation  of  a  significant  new  business  activity  or  the elimination  of  a  significant  business  activity,  a  change  in accounting policy or a major event affecting the markets and/ or L'Or\u00e9al's major competitors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  make  its  decisions  on  the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and, when necessary, after obtaining the opinion of an independent consulting firm.\n\nIt  is  specified  that  this  derogation  can  only  be  temporary pending approval of the amended remuneration policy by the forthcoming  Annual  General  Meeting,  and  would  be  duly documented.",

Director who joined a Board Committee in financial year 2023.\n\n## 2.4.2.2. Remuneration paid during financial year 2023 or allocated for that financial year to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 9 February 2023, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus's  annual  fixed  compensation  at  the gross amount of \u20ac2,000,000.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2. Annual variable remuneration\n\nWith  regard  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus's  annual  variable remuneration  for  2023,  the  target  was  set  at  \u20ac2,000,000 gross on an annual basis, or 100% of his fixed compensation, with a maximum of 120% of fixed compensation in the event of outperformance, or \u20ac2,400,000 gross. This sum represents  the  maximum  amount  of  variable  remuneration that may be paid to him.\n\nAt its meeting on 9 February 2023, the Board of Directors had set  the  variable  remuneration  criteria  applicable  for  2023 and  the  respective  weighting  of  such  criteria.  Financial  criteria represent  60%  of  the  variable  remuneration  while  nonfinancial  criteria  represent  40%.  The  financial  criteria  are directly correlated with the Company's economic performance indicators: growth in sales and market share as compared to its main  competitors,  in  operating  profit,  earnings  per  share  (EPS) and cash flow.\n\nOn 8 February 2024, the Board of Directors, on the basis of  the  recommendations  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  assessed  the  performance  of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus. The rate of achievement was 112.5% of  objectives,  i.e.  a  rate  of  achievement  of  112.1%  for financial criteria and 113.1% for non-financial and qualitative criteria.\n\nIt  was  thus  decided  that,  in  respect  of  annual  variable remuneration  for  2023,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  would  be awarded an amount of \u20ac2,250,000.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first full year  taken  into  account  for  assessment  of  the  performance conditions relating to this grant is 2023.\n\nAs  regards  all  the  free  shares  granted  pursuant  to  the criterion relating to net sales, in order for these to finally vest at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al must outperform the average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors. Below this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in  net  sales  is  lower  than  the  average  growth  in  net sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors,  no  shares  will  be  finally vested under this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all the free shares granted to finally vest at the end of the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the Board but not made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  achieved or  exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  If  the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  criterion  of  fulfilling  commitments  made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, in order for all the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, an average of 70%  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  Commitments  must  be achieved during the vesting period. Below this level, the grant decreases.  No  shares  will  vest  if  the  average  level  of achievement for the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments falls below 55%.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  criterion  of  gender  balance  in  strategic positions, in order for all the free shares granted to be finally vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, the  average  proportion  of  employees  of  each  gender  in strategic positions must be at least 40%. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThe figures recorded year on year to determine the levels of performance achieved are published in chapter 7.\n\n## Main features of the grant\n\nThis  Plan  enabled  650,580  performance  shares  (ACAs),  i.e. 0,1% of the share capital, to be granted to 2,763 beneficiaries.\n\nThe  conditional  grant  of  performance  shares  benefiting Mr Nicolas Hieronimus in 2023 represents 2.61% of the total number of performance shares granted and 0.003% of the share capital as at 9 October 2023.\n\nIn addition, as a corporate officer, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus will retain 50% of the shares that will finally vest at the end of the vesting period in registered form until the end of his term of corporate office.\n\nFurthermore,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  has  undertaken  not  to use risk hedging instruments.\n\nIt  is  reminded  that  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  was  not  awarded any other long-term incentives in 2023.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.4. Remuneration as Director\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus does not receive any remuneration as Director. He does not receive any remuneration as a Director of the Group companies.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.5. Additional social protection schemes\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  continues  to  benefit,  because  of  his classification  as  a  senior  manager  during  his  term  of  office, from the additional social protection schemes and, in particular, the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme, and the employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contributions to the employee benefit  and  healthcare  schemes  for  2023  amounted  to \u20ac4,521.96, and the amount of the employer's contribution to the  Defined  Contribution  Pension  scheme  amounted  to \u20ac6,818.76.\n\nUnder  the  Defined  Contribution  Pension  Scheme  ('L'Or\u00e9al RCD',  as  described  in  chapter  4),  the  rights  of  which  are strictly  proportional  to  the  contributions  paid,  and  which benefits  all  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  France,  the  estimated amount of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus's annual retirement pension at 31 December 2023 would be a gross amount of \u20ac5,945.\n\nAs  for  all  other  senior  managers  of  the  Group,  the  pension resulting from the employer contributions of the L'Or\u00e9al RCD will  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  the  Pension  Cover  for the  calculation  of  the  life  annuity  potentially  due  under  this plan so that these benefits are not combined.\n\nAs a reminder, the lifetime risk related to the plans resulting from Article 83, 2\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code is borne by the insurer.\n\n## 2.4.2.3. Remuneration paid or allocated to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.4.2.3.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 9 February 2023, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain Mr Jean-Paul Agon's annual fixed compensation at the gross amount of \u20ac1,600,000.\n\n## 2.4.2.3.2. Additional social protection schemes\n\nThe Chairman of the Board benefits from the same employee benefit scheme as the senior managers of the Company.\n\nThe  amount  of  employer  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans was \u20ac3,671.16.",

Remuneration  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  all amounts  paid  and  performance  shares  granted  during the financial year in question.\n\nThe  elements  composing  the  executives'  remuneration  used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u00b7 the annual fixed remuneration paid in 2023 (on an annual basis);\n- \u00b7 the  annual  variable  remuneration  paid  in  2023  (on  an annual basis);\n- \u00b7 the performance shares valued on the grant date in 2023 in  accordance  with  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe elements composing employee remuneration used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u00b7 annual fixed remuneration paid in 2023;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in 2023;\n- \u00b7 other elements of annual remuneration paid in 2023;\n- \u00b7 the profit-sharing bonus of \u20ac1,500 paid in 2023;\n- \u00b7 the  performance  shares  granted  in  2023  valued  in accordance  with  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 the gross Profit-sharing and Incentives paid in 2023.\n\n## 2.4.3. Termination indemnities and supplementary pension scheme applicable to corporate officers\n\nThe  termination  indemnities  and  supplementary  pension scheme  for  which  the  corporate  officers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  may  be eligible,  as  long  as  they  are  former  senior  managers  of  the company with more than 15 years of service, are not related to the exercise of the corporate office, but could be due under the suspended employment contract.\n\nTherefore, they are not subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2024  under  resolution no.  16  'Approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chief Executive Officer'.\n\nShareholders  approved  the  agreement  suspending  the executive  corporate  officer's  employment  contract  at  the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n## 2.4.3.1. Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code to which L'Or\u00e9al refers, recommends, but does not require, that companies should put an  end  to  combining  an  employment  contract  with  a corporate office.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  shares  the  objectives  of  this recommendation  which  aims  at  avoiding  the  possibility  of concurrently  obtaining  benefits  both  from  the  employment contract  and  the  corporate  office  and  at  prohibiting  any interference  with  the  possibility  of  removing  executive corporate  officers  ad  nutum.  The  Board  of  Directors  has formally  provided  for  the  methods  of  application  of  the objectives of the recommendation, as adapted to the context in the L'Or\u00e9al Group.\n\nThe Board's intention is to use the treatment set out below for any new corporate officer appointed who has over 15 years' length  of  service  in  the  Group  at  the  time  of  his  or  her appointment.\n\nAs L'Or\u00e9al's ongoing policy is to appoint employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their careers in the Group as executive corporate officers, the Board does not want these executives to be deprived of the benefits to which they would have continued to be entitled had they remained employees,  after  spending  many  years  of  their  career  at L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued by the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation could be fully achieved  by  maintaining  the  suspension  of  the  employment contract  and  clearly  separating  the  benefits  related  to  the corporate  office  from  those  relating  to  the  employment contract.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits that may be due under the employment contract.\n\nThe reference remuneration to be taken into account for all rights attached to the employment contract, in particular, for the  calculation  of  the  pension  under  the  defined  benefit scheme is based on the amount of remuneration at the date of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration is revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse) .  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.",

Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  suspended  employment contract during the exercise of the term of corporate office, and  depending  on  the  reasons  for  such  termination,  the executive  corporate  officer  would  only  be  paid  termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's request pursuant to the suspended  employment  contract  excluding  any indemnity due in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques) and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable to  all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to the  public  policy  rules  of  French  labour  law.  They  are  not subject  to  any  condition  other  than  those  provided  for  by the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the Chemical  Industries  or  the  above-mentioned  company-level agreements.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract, financial consideration for the non-compete clause would be paid  under  the  terms  of  said  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions  of  the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement for  the  Chemical  Industries,  unless  the  executive  corporate officer  were  to  be  released  from  application  of  the  clause. This clause does not apply in the event of voluntary retirement or compulsory  retirement  on  the  Company's  initiative: no  consideration  for  non-competition  would  be  paid  in  such a situation.\n\n## 2.4.3.3. Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nThe executive corporate officer, subject to ending his or her career  in  the  Company,  will  benefit  from  one  of  the  defined benefit  schemes  currently  applicable  to  the  Group's  senior managers. This is the scheme to which he or she was subject as an employee.\n\nAs a reminder, the rights to the defined benefit pension are uncertain and conditional on the completion of the beneficiary's  career  in  the  Company.  These  schemes  were established  by  L'Or\u00e9al  primarily  with  the  goal  of  attracting and retaining the Company's senior managers by guaranteeing them a certain level of resources in retirement.\n\nThese  schemes  falling  under  Article  L.  137-11  of  the  French Social Security Code, are now closed to any new beneficiaries and  no  longer  create  rights  as  from  31  December  2019 pursuant  to  French  Order  no.  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  on professional supplementary pension schemes that transposes the European Directive of 16 April 2014.\n\nThe main features of these schemes are explained in detail in paragraph 4.3.2.5.\n\nThey  concern  over  500  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  active  or  retired  senior managers, in France, and are financed by contributions paid to an insurance institution. These contributions are deductible from  the  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's  contribution  as  provided  by  Article  L.  137-11,  2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nIn  the  light  of  the  legal  characteristics  of  defined  benefit pension  schemes  (the  rights  only  accrue  if  the  beneficiary ends  his  career  in  the  Company  and  the  financing  of  this scheme cannot be broken down individually by employee) and\n\non  account  of  the  characteristics  specific  to  the  L'Or\u00e9al schemes, known as 'differential' schemes since they take into account, in order to supplement them, all the other pensions such as those resulting, inter alia, from the French basic and supplementary  pension  schemes,  the  precise  amount  of  the pension  annuity  will  in  fact  only  be  calculated  on  the  date when the beneficiary applies for all his pensions.\n\n## 2.4.3.4. Application of the related-party agreements scheme\n\nThe  above  provisions  are  subject  to  the  procedure  for related-party agreements.\n\nFor  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  an  agreement  suspending  his employment  contract  was  approved  by  the  Annual  General Meeting of 20 April 2021 (resolution no. 15). This mechanism is restated every year in the present chapter and in the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements.\n\n## 2.4.3.5. Situation of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  at  its  meeting  of  20  April  2021 appointed  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  the  then  Deputy  Chief Executive Officer in charge of Divisions, and an employee of L'Or\u00e9al, as Chief Executive Officer following a brilliant career spanning 34 years within L'Or\u00e9al. The Board of Directors did not wish for Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, by accepting the role of Chief Executive Officer, to be deprived (at the age of 57 and after 34 years with L'Or\u00e9al) of the benefits to which he would have continued to be entitled had he remained an employee. Therefore, the Board adopted the following measures, which were  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  20  April 2021 as part of the procedure for related-party agreements:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe reference remuneration of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus to be taken into account for all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for the calculation of the pension under the defined-benefit scheme described below, is based on  his  remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  his employment contract. This reference remuneration is \u20ac1,750,000  of  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,850,000  of variable  remuneration.  This  remuneration  will  be  revised annually by applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of salaries  and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French state  pension  fund (Caisse  Nationale  d'Assurance  Vieillesse) . As  at  1 January  2024,  it  was  \u20ac1,951,250  for  fixed remuneration and \u20ac2,062,750 for variable remuneration.\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the noncompetition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the exercise of the term of corporate office, and  depending  on  the  reasons  for  such  termination,  Mr Nicolas Hieronimus would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities in the event of voluntary retirement  or  at  the  Company's  request  pursuant  to  the suspended employment contract.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nRemuneration of Directors and corporate officers\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques) and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable to  all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to the  public  policy  rules  of  French  labour  law.  They  are  not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries or the above-mentioned Company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nPursuant  to  the  scale  of  indemnities  under  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries, in  the  event  of  dismissal,  except  in  the  event  of  gross misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  the  indemnity  would  be capped, in light of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' length of service, at 20  months'  remuneration  under  the  suspended  employment contract.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions  of  the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement for the Chemical Industries and in the event of termination of the employment contract, the indemnity due in consideration of the non-compete clause would be payable monthly for two years  on  the  basis  of  two-thirds  of  the  monthly  fixed remuneration attached to the suspended  employment contract  unless  Mr  Hieronimus  were  to  be  released  from application  of  the  clause.  This  clause  does  not  apply  in  the event of voluntary retirement or compulsory retirement on the Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for  non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  continue  to  benefit,  under  his suspended  employment  contract  during  the  exercise  of  the corporate  office,  from  the  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des Retraites  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants'  (Retirement  Income Guarantee  for  Former  Senior  Managers)  scheme  closed  to new members effective from 31 December 2015. The income guarantee is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service in the Company up to 31 December 2019, up to a limit of 25 years. Generally, after 31 December 2019, no  new  rights  are  granted  under  this  scheme,  pursuant  to French  Order  no.  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  concerning supplementary professional retirement schemes, which stipulated the closure of all defined benefit schemes governed by Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code.\n\nThe main features of this scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 around  340  senior  managers  (active  or  retired)  are concerned;\n- \u00b7 the  minimum  length  of  service  requirement  was  10  years at the time of closure of the scheme on 31 December 2015;\n- \u00b7 the  income  guarantee  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the number  of  years  of  professional  service  in  the  Company until  31  December  2019,  capped  at  25  years,  each  year leading to a progressive and regular increase of 1.8% in the level of the guarantee. The pension cannot exceed 50% of the calculation base or exceed the average of the fixed part of wages;\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  is  financed  by  contributions  paid  to  an insurance  institution.  These  contributions  are  deductible from  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe  pension  rights  of  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  are  no  longer likely  to  change  insofar  as  he  has  more  than  25  years  of service,  the  ceiling  above  which  no  additional  annuity  is granted  under  this  scheme.  For  information  purposes,  the gross estimated amount of the pension that would be paid to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Ressources des Retrait\u00e9s Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee for Former Senior Managers) scheme, had he been able to liquidate on 31 December 2023 his full-rate pension rights under French Social Security, after 36 years of service within L'Or\u00e9al, would represent \u20ac1.68 million.\n\nThis information is given as an indication after estimating the main  pension  rights  accrued  by  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  a result of his professional activities, according to the rules for payment  of  such  pensions  in  force  at  31  December  2023, which may be subject to change. The amount of the pension paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  under  L'Or\u00e9al's  'Garantie  de Ressources Dirigeants' (income guarantee for senior managers) will only be calculated on the date when he applies for all his pensions.\n\nAs a reminder, the rights to the defined benefit pension are uncertain and conditional on the completion of the beneficiary's  career  in  the  Company.  The  financing  of  this scheme  by  L'Or\u00e9al  cannot  be  broken  down  individually  by employee.\n\n## 2.4.3.6.  Situation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon notified the Company of the termination of  his  employment  contract  on  30  April  2021,  in  order  to  be able to draw his retirement benefits as from 1 May 2021, after a 42-year career with the organisation. Under his suspended employment contract, Mr Jean-Paul Agon is entitled to draw the pension cover for members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture (Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) , a supplementary pension scheme that closed on 31 December 2000.\n\nThe annuity entitlement under this scheme was approved, in the  context  of  the  related-party  agreements  procedure,  by the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  27  April  2010  and  by  the Annual General Meeting of 17 April 2018. In accordance with the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  in his  position  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  he irrevocably  waived  his  right  to  receive  all  retirement  annuity arrears  resulting  from  this  scheme  from  1  May  2021  to 30 April 2024.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon informed L'Or\u00e9al of his intention to draw this annuity from 1 May 2024.",

It should be understood that the agreements reported on are  only  those  provided  for  by  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  that  the  report  does  not  apply  to  those  related-party transactions described in IAS 24 or other equivalent accounting standards.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditors of your Company, we hereby report to you on regulated agreements.\n\nThe terms of our engagement require us to communicate to you, based on information provided to us, the principal terms and conditions of those agreements brought to our attention or which we may have discovered during the course of our audit, as well as the reasons justifying that such agreements are in the Company's interest, without expressing an opinion on their usefulness and  appropriateness  or  identifying  other  such  agreements,  if  any.  It  is  your  responsibility,  pursuant  to  Article  R.225-31  of  the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the interest involved in respect of the conclusion of these agreements for the purpose of approving them.\n\nOur role is also to provide you with the information stipulated in Article R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code relating to the implementation during the past year of agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting, if any.\n\nWe  conducted  the  procedures  we  deemed  necessary  in  accordance  with  the  professional  guidelines  of  the  French  National Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors  (Compagnie  nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes)  relating  to  this  engagement.  These procedures consisted in agreeing the information provided to us with the relevant source documents.\n\n## Agreements submitted to the approval of the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Agreements authorized and entered into during the year\n\nWe hereby  inform  you  that  we  have  not  been  advised  of  any  agreement  authorized  and  entered  into  during  the  year  to  be submitted to the approval of the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Previously approved agreements that remained in force during the year\n\nPursuant to Article R.225-30 of the French Commercial Code, we have been informed that the following agreement, previously approved by Annual General Meetings of prior years, has remained in force during the year.\n\n## Agreement concerning the position of Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer of your company\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nOn  February  11,  2021,  your  Board  of  Directors  authorized  an  agreement  to  suspend  the  employment  contract  between  your company  and  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  former  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  employee  of  your  company,  who  became  the Company's Chief Executive Officer as of May 1, 2021, following the decision of the Board of Directors' meeting held at the close of the Annual General Meeting of April 20, 2021.\n\nThis agreement was entered into following the Board of Directors' meeting and became effective as of May 1,2021.\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\n- \u00b7 Suspension of Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract during the term of his corporate office\n\nIn the event of termination of his suspended employment contract during the term of office, and depending on the reasons for such  termination,  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will  only  receive  the  severance  pay  (save  for  gross  misconduct  or  gross  negligence)  or retirement  indemnities  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  retirement  at  the  Company's  request,  payable  under  the employment contract that has been suspended. These indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment contract and in strict application of the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry ( Convention collective nationale des industries chimiques ) and the company-level agreements applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the collective  bargaining  agreement  or  the  above-mentioned  company-level  agreements.  The  same  applies  to  the  non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nNicolas Hieronimus will continue to benefit, under his employment contract suspended for the term of his corporate office, from the  ' Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants '  (Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  former  senior managers) scheme, closed to new entrants as from December 31, 2015. Indemnities are calculated according to the number of years of professional activity within the company as of December 31, 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. In general, subsequent to December  31,  2019,  no  new  entitlement  is  granted  under  this  scheme  pursuant  to  Order  2019-697  of  July  3,  2019  on supplementary pension schemes, which provides for the closure of all defined-benefit schemes governed by Article L.137-11 of the French Social Security Code ( Code la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ). The main features of this scheme are described in Note 4.3.2.5 to the 2022 L'Or\u00e9al  Universal  Registration  Document.  In  this  specific  case,  Nicolas  Hieronimus  reached  the  limit  of  25  years'  professional activity  in  the  Group  provided  under  the  scheme  in  2012  and  therefore  has  not  benefited  from  any  new  entitlement  to supplementary annuities since such date.\n\nUnder his employment contract and in accordance with the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry, in the event of termination of the employment contract, the compensation under the non-compete clause would be payable monthly over two years based on two-thirds of the monthly fixed remuneration provided for in the suspended employment contract, unless Nicolas  Hieronimus  was  released  from  the  application  of  this  clause.    This  clause  is  not  applicable  in  the  event  of  voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's request and no non-compete compensation would be paid in this situation.\n\nUnder  no  circumstances  shall  the  remuneration  received  for  the  corporate  office  be  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating benefits likely to be payable under the above-mentioned employment contract.\n\n- \u00b7 Terms and conditions relating to the suspension of Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract\n- \u00b7 The  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all  entitlements  attached  to  the  employment  contract  and particularly the calculation of the aforementioned retirement benefits, will be based on the amount of remuneration at the date  of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract  in  2021,  namely,  fixed  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,750,000  and  variable remuneration of \u20ac1,850,000. This reference remuneration will be revised annually by applying the revaluation coefficient in respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  (Caisse  nationale  d'assurance vieillesse). As of January 1, 2024 it comprised a fixed portion of \u20ac1,951,250 and a variable portion of \u20ac2,062,750.\n- \u00b7 The length of service applied will cover his entire career within the Group, including his years as executive officer.\n- \u00b7 The continued treatment of Nicolas Hieronimus in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office  would  allow  him  to  benefit  from  the  additional  social  protection  schemes,  including  the  defined-contribution  pension scheme and employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.

It presents the internal control environment of L'Or\u00e9al, including the system  relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  accounting  and  financial  information. It describes the risk factors pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of 14 June 2017 ('Prospectus Directive III'), as well as the associated risk management policy. These risks are presented in four categories: (i) business risks, (ii) industrial and environmental risks, (iii) legal and regulatory risks, (iv)  financial  and  market  risks.  The  main  non-financial  risks  within  the  meaning  of  the Non-Financial Performance Statement (1) are described in chapter 4. The Vigilance Plan (2) is  also included in this chapter.\n\n## 3.1. Definition and objectives of Internal Control\n\n## 3.1.1. Reference work\n\nFor the purposes of preparing this Document and defining Internal Control, L'Or\u00e9al has used the Reference Framework and its application guide published by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in January 2007, and updated on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.1.2. Internal Control - preventing and controlling risk\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (the  'Group'), which aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with  the  laws  and  regulations  in  force  and  the  Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing risks, the Internal Control system  promotes  the  steady  and  sustainable manufacturing  and  economic  development  of  the  Group within  a  control  environment  that  is  appropriate  for  the Group's  businesses.  However,  any  system  or  process  has  its limitations.  These  result  from  a  number  of  factors,  in particular the uncertainties of the outside world or malfunctions due to technical or human failures.\n\nThe  handling  of  risk  should  be  based  in  particular  on  a reasonable  informed  choice  between  the  challenges  to  be controlled, the opportunities to be seized, the cost of the risk management measures, and the effects of these measures on the occurrence and impact of the risk.\n\n## 3.1.3. A process for the continual improvement of the Internal Control system\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  continued  its  efforts  to  improve  the system of Internal Control by, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 constantly adjusting the Group matrix for the segregation of duties and the associated control environment;\n- \u00b7 providing  new  operational  guides  to  remind  employees  of the  Group's  principles  and  enable  the  sharing  of  best practices (e.g. the update to the 'The Way We Work With Healthcare  Professionals'  guide  and  the  Property  Assets Playbook);\n- \u00b7 regularly  adapting  the  reference  frameworks  to  address new challenges;\n- \u00b7 updating the Group's digital referential (3) ; and\n- \u00b7 revamping  of  the  programme  to  raise  awareness  of  the risks of fraud.\n\nThe deployment of online learning (prevention of corruption, data  security,  competition,  cyber  security,  personal  data protection) is ongoing.\n\n- \u00b7 updating  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control'  digital library (e.g. on product quality and safety, and information systems);",

Components of the Internal Control and Risk Management system\n\n## 3.2.1. Organisation and environment\n\nThe  control  environment  is  critical  to  the  Internal  Control system.  It  ensures  to  properly  manage  the  risks  and implement  procedures.  It  is  based  on  behaviours,  the organisational  structure  and  employees.  At  L'Or\u00e9al,  it  forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment communicated by senior management in line with the Group's strategic choices.\n\n## The Group's Ethical Principles\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  development  and  reputation  are  built  on  strong Ethical Principles: Integrity, Respect, Courage and Transparency.  The  Group's  policies  on  sustainability,  social and  societal  responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are based on the Ethical Principles.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics is available in 30 languages and as an audiobook  in  English  and  French.  In  2023,  it  was completely  overhauled.  It  is  distributed  to  all  employees around the world. It uses simple rules and concrete examples to explain how they can apply these Ethical Principles in their behaviours and actions.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  applies  to  all  employees,  directors  and corporate  officers  and  members  of  the  Executive  and Management Committees.\n\n## The Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer\n\nThe Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer reports directly to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  keeps  him  informed  on  a regular basis. The Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer regularly  informs  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Executive Committee. His mission on Ethics is to:\n\n- \u00b7 promote  and  integrate  best  practices  within  the  Group, by facilitating ethical decision-making;\n- \u00b7 oversee employee learning;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  management  of  alerts  and  directly  manage those related to senior management positions; and\n- \u00b7 measure and assess the Company's ethical performance.\n\nThey  have  a  dedicated  budget  and  team,  and  unrestricted access to all information about the Group's business activities. They can call upon any of the Group's teams and resources in the performance of their work.\n\n## PERIODIC C ONTR OL\n\nPERMANENT\n\nOL\n\nONTR\n\nC\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer systematically  meets  each  new  Country  Manager  and  the Group's senior managers to provide guidance about their role. Senior managers also benefit from a tool to help develop their ethics leadership as well as specific learning.\n\nThe  81  Ethics  Correspondents  throughout  the  world  assist members of the Executive Committee and Country Managers to implement the ethics programme. Led by the Group Ethics team, they provide all employees with a local point of contact. They  promote  the  normal  routes  for  handling  concerns  by Management and Human Resources.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, a member of the Executive Committee, oversees the respect of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms in the Group.\n\nThe  ethical  and  Human  Rights  risks  are  mapped  and regularly updated, which includes suppliers and subcontractors  (see  subsection  3.4.3.).  Country  Managers assess and analyse local ethical risks using a dedicated tool. They adopt the necessary prevention measures.\n\nAn annual reporting system is used to monitor the implementation  of  the  Ethics  and  Human  Rights  programme. The  Global  Ethics,  Risk  &  Compliance  Department  informs subsidiaries of their potential areas for improvement. Ethics risks are  systematically  reviewed  during  audit  assignments,  through individual  interviews  conducted  separately  with  the  Country Manager and the Administrative and Financial Director.\n\nFor  prospective  acquisitions,  the  Ethics  and  Human  Rights questionnaire helps to determine whether the target company takes  account  of  risks,  particularly  those  related  to  business ethics.\n\nA specific and compulsory e-learning course on ethics is available in all subsidiaries.  It  was  updated  in  2023  following  the publication of the new Code of Ethics. As at 31 December 2022, 87% of the employees with access to the course had completed it.  The  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department  also  provides face-to-face  learning  as  part  of  the  ongoing  learning  of managers  and  certain  business  functions  (Country  Managers, Buyers and Human Resources). As at 31 December 2023, 66% of the relevant employees had already completed it.\n\nThe evaluation of the overall performance of employees, and more  specifically  managers,  takes  into  account  compliance with  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  Ethical  Principles.  Regular communication  with  stakeholders  and  the  setting  up  of internal  working  groups  help  to  incorporate  Ethics  into  new policies and strategic decisions.\n\nThe  Group's  whistleblowing  line  (www.lorealspeakup.com), available  to  all  Group  stakeholders,  as  well  as  a  procedure to collect and process reports, make it possible to manage any violations.\n\nIn  2023,  678  potential  ethical  violations  were  identified  either via the secure website, or via the Ethics Correspondents or local or international management. After reported cases have been thoroughly examined, appropriate measures are taken, where applicable.  The  global  number  of  reports  of  discrimination, harassment  (including  sexual  harassment)  and  corruption received at Group level worldwide is notified to employees on a regular basis, as is the number of fully or partially substantiated cases and the corrective measures taken.\n\n(1)\n\n## Ethics Day: an annual day on ethics\n\nThe Group has held Ethics Day since 2009. During this online event hosted by the Chief Executive Officer, Group employees can ask questions and discuss the day-to-day application of the  Ethical  Principles.  Each  member  of  the  Executive Committee and each Country Manager organises local ethics discussions. In 2023, with over 37,000 people logging on and more  than  6,600  questions,  employees  showed  that  they were  heavily  engaged  with  this  subject.  Furthermore,  they receive  regular  information  about  the  Group's  Ethical  policy and have access to a dedicated Intranet site.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n\nFor many years, L'Or\u00e9al has adopted an ambitious CSR policy, in  particular  through  its  sustainability  programmes  and  its goals  within  the  framework  of  the  Science  Based  Targets initiative (1) .\n\nIn this context, the Group has developed a strong governance structure (see section 4.1.), which includes the establishment of Sustainability  Leaders  worldwide.  They  are  tasked  with helping  the  Country,  Zone,  Division  and  Brand  Managers  to implement the sustainability programme within their entities. The progress of local implementation of the Group's commitments is monitored by means of an annual reporting system.\n\nInternal  Audit  regularly  reviews  CSR  risks,  as  well  as  the extent  to  which  any  policies  adopted  to  address  such  risks have progressed. The results are then reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nSince  2019,  in  collaboration  with  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance  Department,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Corporate  Responsibility Department has conducted a deeper assessment of the risks associated  with  climate  change  related  to  the  Group's operations,  relying  in  particular  on  the  scenario  analysis method. These departments intended to improve their ability to anticipate and mitigate the impact of these risks. It should be  noted  that  the  financial  risks  related  to  the  effects  of climate change and the Group's measures to reduce them are described in chapter 4.\n\n## Human Resources policy\n\nThe quality and skills of female and male employees are key components of the Internal Control system. L'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources  (HR)  Department  has  always  had  the  mission  of supporting the Group's growth and supporting its transformation initiatives. In order to be sustainable, L'Or\u00e9al's growth  relies  first  and  foremost  on  the  women  and  men  in the Company, who are the key drivers of the Group's success. Built on this conviction, the Group's human and social project is  based  on  individualised  management  of  employees  and on collective strength.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  HR  policy  is  based  on  the  identification,  recruitment and development of employees throughout their career, and on the rewarding and commitment of all, as well as on an active policy on diversity, equity and inclusion. Dedicated policies are developed within the Group  in each of these areas (see subsection 4.3.2.).",

        "page_content": "## Information systems\n\nThe Group's Global IT Department issues strategic orientations  for  its  IT  systems  and  information  systems security  (ISS)  guidelines.  The  systems  incorporate  'ERP (Enterprise  Resource  Planning)',  a  management  software application used  by  the  vast  majority  of  commercial subsidiaries. The  worldwide  roll-out  of  this integrated software  package  reinforces  the  reliability  and  security  of producing  information,  including  accounting  and  financial information. In pursuit of the same objective, the deployment of an integrated production and management solution in the Group's manufacturing entities is continuing.\n\n## The procedures and standards governing the activities\n\nEach Functional Division defines, in its own specific field, the principles and standards applicable to the entities it manages. These  principles  and  standards  are  summarised  in  the 'Fundamentals of Internal Control', a guide which is regularly updated  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department, so that employees can adopt them more easily.  This  document  provides  a  reference  framework for the Group. It covers operational activities in the form of an information sheet for each area of activity. Each information sheet refers to the detailed charters, codes and standards of the  Group.  The  sheets  are  regularly  updated,  expanded  and validated by the Functional Divisions.\n\nComponents of the Internal Control and Risk Management system\n\nA  management  segregation  of  duties  standard  is  regularly updated  and  distributed  to  all  entities.  It  defines  the  main rules for sales, purchasing, logistics, finance, human resources and  information  systems  management.  The  application  of these  rules  prevents  the  risks  of  fraud  and  reduces  the probability that errors (whether intentional or not) may remain undetected.\n\n## Communication of information inside the Group\n\nThe 'Fundamentals of Internal Control' are circulated to the Managing  Directors,  Finance  Directors,  and  Internal  Control Managers  of  all  the  consolidated  subsidiaries,  including manufacturing  entities.  The  Fundamentals,  codes,  charters, standards,  and  information  related  to  the  organisation, variations and instructions from the Support Departments are made  permanently  available  to  the  subsidiaries  on  the Group's  Intranet  sites.  A  digital  standard  provides  all  Group employees  with  guides, charters and  expert  contacts organised by function and by subject.\n\nThe  Functional  Divisions  also  hold  seminars  and  learning sessions for their networks of experts. News published on the Intranet  gives  employees  news  updates  and  meaningful messages on Internal Control.\n\nWithin  the  Group,  two  tools  promote  communication  on  the priorities of Internal Control:\n\n- 1. the 'Internal Control Awards', which take place every two years and reward the best global initiatives; and\n- 2. the  Internal  Control  Department's  Intranet  site,  which disseminates Internal Control's initiatives, tools and events all over the world.\n\n## 3.2.2. Control and supervision activities: those involved and their roles\n\nRisk  management  and  Internal  Control  is  the  business  of everyone,  from  governance  bodies  to  all  employees.  This system is continually monitored to ensure it is relevant, meets the  Group's  objectives  and  addresses  its  issues.  The  main players  in  the  monitoring  of  Internal  Control  and  risk management are:\n\n- \u00b7 the General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee);\n- \u00b7 the Board of Directors and especially the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department,  the  Internal Control Department and the Internal Audit Department;\n- \u00b7 the Functional Divisions; and\n- \u00b7 the Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones.\n\n## The General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee)\n\nThe  General  Management  defines  the  general  principles  of Internal  Control  and  ensures  their  proper  implementation.  In order to fulfil their global Internal Control responsibilities, the\n\nmembers of the Executive Committee rely on operational and functional  managers,  according  to  their  areas  of  expertise. These  managers  must  ensure  these  general  principles  are implemented and the procedures correctly applied to achieve the level of Internal Control required by General Management.\n\n## The Board of Directors and Audit Committee\n\nThe Board of Directors has always asserted the importance of  Internal  Control  and  its  main  areas  of  application (1) . The Internal Rules of the Board of Directors define the Audit Committee's duties:\n\n- \u00b7 it monitors the action taken by Internal Control and reports this to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 it is responsible  for  monitoring  issues  relating  to  the preparation  of  accounting  and  financial  information  and for corporate sustainability reporting; and\n- \u00b7 each year, it reviews the Internal Audit plan, its objectives and the general conclusions of Internal Audit assignments, as  well  as  the  initiatives  and  major  projects  that  relate to Internal Control. The Committee uses this information to report its remarks to the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Alongside the Management of each country, business or manufacturing entity,  the  Divisions  and  Zones  are  fully  responsible  for achieving  the  Internal  Control  objectives  defined  by  General Management.\n\nA system of delegating authorities is in place and continues to be  reinforced.  The  powers  of  the  legal  representatives  of Group  companies  and  of  those  to  whom  they  delegate  are limited  and  controlled  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the  Legal  Charter.  Specialists  in  management,  information systems, Human Relations digital, retail, purchasing, logistics, production  and  legal  affairs  provide  support  to  operations at all levels and help to ensure the Internal Control objectives are achieved.\n\n## The Functional Departments\n\nEach member of the Executive Committee is entrusted with worldwide  responsibility  for  the  Internal  Control  of  the activities that fall within their remit. The Support Departments define,  in  their  own  areas,  the  strategies,  policies  and procedures  which  they  communicate  to  the  countries  and entities. They bring their expertise to the operational divisions and review the proper functioning of their respective areas of responsibility.  They  rely  on  their  network  of  specialists  or  on regular audits.\n\nThe main Departments concerned are:\n\n- \u00b7 the Research, Innovation and Technology Department, with particular regard to cosmeto-vigilance and the quality of the formulas used in the products (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2.);\n- \u00b7 the Purchasing Departments with regard to suppliers and their working conditions;\n- \u00b7 the Environment, Health & Safety Department, with regard to  checking site  safety  and  ensuring  employee health and environmental compliance;\n- \u00b7 the  Quality  Department  to  measure  performance  and the  progress  made  by  manufacturing  entities  with  regard to the quality of production;\n- \u00b7 the  Global  IT  Department,  primarily  to  assess  compliance with the Cyber Security Policy;\n- \u00b7 the Administration and Finance Department;\n- \u00b7 the  Human  Resources  Department,  with  regard  to  the monitoring and supervision of obligations in respect of staff management, specifically:\n- \u00b7 the documents to be provided to employees;\n- \u00b7 the  remuneration  of  the  workforce  and  personnel expenses;\n- \u00b7 recruitment, learning and evaluation procedures, the rules to be followed in respect of payroll management and the implementation of the Share & Care programme;\n- \u00b7 the Engagement  and  Public  Affairs  Department  to coordinate communications campaigns and ensure that the Group's responsible lobbying policies are applied;\n- \u00b7 the  Digital  and  Marketing  Department,  with  regard  to securing  the  Group's  digital  transformation  (e-commerce, consumer  relations,  influencers,  digital  media  etc.)  by defining the policies, tools and processes and ensuring they are deployed; and\n- \u00b7 the  Security  Department,  with  regard  to  the  security  of people, travel, property, information and data confidentiality, as well as crisis management (see paragraph 3.5.3.1); and\n- \u00b7 the Corporate Responsibility Department: see section 3.2.1.\n\nIndicators  and  reporting  procedures  facilitate  the  regular monitoring of the local activities of these Functional Departments.\n\n## The Administration and Finance Department\n\nThe department assists and monitors operational employees in their administrative, financial and legal activities, as well as in terms of information processing. It sets the operating rules for all entities, defines and deploys tools, procedures and best practices,  particularly  in  terms  of  management,  accounting and  consolidation,  M&A, investments  (BOLD  corporate venture fund) and holdings, financing and cash, taxation, legal matters  and  data  governance  (including  personal  data), financial communication, strategic planning and insurance.\n\nAn  Internal  Control  Committee  has  the  task  of  taking  all measures  to  promote  the  proper  understanding  and  the proper  application  of  the  Group's  Internal  Control  rules  and also  to  monitor  progress  on  important  Internal  Control projects. It is composed of the Chief Financial Officer, and the Directors  of  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance,  Internal  Control, Operational Finance, Internal Audit and Information Systems (Global IT).\n\n## Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department\n\nIn  particular,  this  Department  coordinates  the  procedures  for identifying,  assessing  and  prioritising  risks  with  all  those concerned. It keeps the Group's risk mapping up to date. Its aim is to promote optimal use of resources in order to minimise and control  the  impact  of  negative  events,  as  well  as  maximise opportunities.  The  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  &  Compliance  Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## The Internal Control Department\n\nThis  Department,  which  is  separate  from  Internal  Audit,  is under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance Department. In collaboration with the experts in each business line,  it  defines  and  updates  the  internal  control  framework relating to their area  of  activity. This framework  is summarised  in  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control' reference document and detailed in standards and procedures that are listed in the Group's 'digital referential'.\n\nThe Internal Control Department also manages and develops a  network  of  around  170  regional  and  local  internal  control managers covering all Group entities. Their role is to apply the internal  control  framework  and  support  employees  in  this respect. Frequent participation in seminars, learning cycles or webinars  with  functions,  and  the  publication  of  notes  of engagement  help  to  strengthen  knowledge  of  the  internal control framework within the Group.\n\nWithin  a  continuous  improvement  process,  the  Internal Control  Department develops, disseminates and coordinates self-evaluation  campaigns  focusing  on  the  main  risks  and issues identified. These campaigns are gradually being rolled out  in  each  of  the  functions.  The  self-evaluation  of  Internal Control  makes  it  possible  for  the  Group's  entities  to  ensure the due and proper functioning of the system and reinforces it with operational actions.",

        "page_content": "The Internal Control Committee is driven by the Internal Control Department, which validates directions and priorities with regard to  improving  the  internal  control  framework,  developing  the network  of  internal  control  managers  and  the  tools  used  to perform  internal  control  tasks.  This  Department  monitors variations  related  to  Internal  Control  relating  to  expectations and market practices.\n\n## The Internal Audit Department\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  audits  major  processes  and checks on the application of Group principles and standards. Its work is carried out by a central team that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nInternal  Audit  assignments  are  submitted  to  the  General Management and the Audit Committee. With the approval of those  committees,  they  result  in  an  annual  audit  plan  that takes  account  of  the  Group's  risk  mapping,  the  entities' contributions to the Group's key economic indicators, and the historical precedence and results of previous audits.\n\nThe risk level assessment carried out by the Zone Departments and  experts  in  the  different  functions  is  also  a  determining factor in the elaboration of the annual audit plan.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  carried  out  51 assignments, 24 of which involved auditing entities (commercial  entities,  factories,  international  marketing  and research & innovation departments) and 19 of which were on targeted  processes  at  Group,  Zone  or  Country  level.  In addition,  five  assignments  were  carried  out  on  the  cyber security  programme  and  three  were  dedicated  to  certain objectives of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme.\n\nEach  audit  assignment  results  in  a  report  that  sets  out  the corresponding findings and risks, and that proposes an action plan and  recommendations  for  the  audited  entity.  The  Internal  Audit Department  monitors  and  measures  these  action  plans,  then reports the rate of progress to the Departments in question.\n\nTo  conduct  its  work,  Internal  Audit  relies  on  the  Group's integrated ERP software. It has developed a number of specific transactions to improve the identification of potential weaknesses  in  sensitive  processes.  Data  analysis  capabilities are  strengthened  each  year.  They  enhance  the  standard analyses  developed  by  Internal  Audit  and  the  use  of dashboards  and  analysis  tools  that  the  businesses  are continually developing for their own management needs.\n\nTo carry out its work, the Internal Audit Department uses an integrated  GRC  (Governance,  Risk,  Compliance)  tool,  which enables  it  to  consolidate  in  real-time  the  progress  made  on the action plans of audited entities. Shared with the Internal Control function, this tool represents an integrated collaborative platform for the implementation of action plans.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  role  of  monitoring  the  application  of  the Internal Control system, the Internal Audit Department carries out cross-functional analyses with regard to possible Internal Control  weaknesses  based  on  findings  noted  during  its assignments.  These  analyses  direct  the  work  of  the  Internal Control  Committee  and  identify  the  priority  areas  for improvement and strengthening of procedures.\n\nThe achievement of the audit plan, the results of assignments and the progress of the action plans are presented to General Management on a regular basis and to the Audit Committee and the Statutory Auditors annually.\n\n## The Global IT Department\n\nThe  Group's  Global  IT  Department  determines  the  strategic orientations of its IT systems. In particular, it implements ERP, a  management  software  which  is  used  by  the  vast  majority of the Group's commercial subsidiaries, factories and logistics services.  It  also  supports  the  digital  transformation  of  the Group  by  developing  the  use  of Cloud  services (SaaS,  IaaS, PaaS) and connected objects.\n\nWithin  the  Department,  the  Information  Systems  Security Department  manages  the  Information  Systems  Security  Policy. Consistent  with  market  standards  (ISO  27001/27002,  NIST), this  policy  covers  the  main  topics  of  IT  security,  including the protection of personal data. It describes general principles to be  applied  for  each  topic.  This  ensures  that  the  Group's Information  Systems  teams,  and  by  extension,  all  employees, share clear objectives, best practices and levels of control that are appropriate for the risks (notably, the risk of cyber attacks). This policy  is  accompanied  by  an  independent  information  systems security  audit  programme  and  two  codes  of  practice:  the Information  and  Communication Technologies Code of Practice, and the Code of Good Practice for the use of Social Media.\n\n## The Operations Department\n\nThis  Department  comprises  the  Packaging  and  Development, Purchasing,  Industrial  Strategy  and  Operational  Excellence, Quality,  EHS  (Environment,  Health,  Safety),  Supply  Chain  and Information  Systems  (production)  departments.  It  defines  the overall Operations strategy worldwide and defines the standards and methods applicable in the areas of quality,  safety  and  the environment  for  deployment  in  all  the  countries  in  which  the Group operates. It manages the Group's comprehensive strategy to enable the Operations teams in the operational Divisions and the Zones to implement innovation, purchasing, quality, security, environmental manufacturing and supply chain policies that are relevant  to  the  markets.  It  conducts  a  worldwide  Quality-EHS audit  programme,  assessing  the  Group's  sites  and  suppliers  of direct purchases. It establishes and  trains the business communities of these departments.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics,  buyers  have  had access to  a  practical  and  ethical  guide,  'The  Way  We  Work with  our  Suppliers',  since  2011.  This  guide  covers  everything they need to know when working with the Group's suppliers. In addition, buyers complete online learning programmes based on  the  Group's  'The  Way  We  Compete'  and  'The  Way  We Prevent Corruption' guides.\n\nThe  standard  for  managing  suppliers  and  tender  procedures specify  the  conditions  for  competitive  tendering  and  for  the registration of the main suppliers. The general terms of purchase form  the  framework  for  transactions  with  suppliers.  The 'Standard  for  supplier  management  (Source  to  contract)' facilitates and strengthens control of spending and investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  methods  used  include  managing  order processing, from order receipt to preparation, supplying and recovering  credit,  preparing  sales  and  supply  forecasts,\n\ndeploying inventories of finished products and jobs, managing centres,  subcontractors  and  logistics  service  providers,  and monitoring traceability and logistics continuity plans.\n\nThe  Packaging  Development  teams  implement  a  materials vigilance programme  that  ensures  consumer  safety  in connection  with  packaging  materials,  as  well  as  regulatory monitoring  in  connection  with  R&I  of  all  legal  obligations related to packaging and their labelling.\n\n## 3.3. Preparing and processing of accounting and financial information\n\nThis  paragraph  is  based  on  the  'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of  accounting  and  financial  information  published  by issuers', from the Reference Framework published by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) on 22 July 2010. It is part of an overall process aimed at making continual progress and improving the Internal Control system that is already in place.\n\n## 3.3.1. Definition, scope and objectives\n\nInternal  Control  for  accounting  and  finance  covers  the processes that provide accounting data, i.e. the processes for producing financial information, closing the accounts process and communication campaigns.\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  Internal  Control  process  is designed to ensure:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance  with  accounting  regulations  and  the  correct application  of  the  principles  on  which  the  financial statements are based;\n- \u00b7 application of the guidelines set by the General Management for financial information;\n- \u00b7 quality of the reporting used to prepare published financial statements and reliability of their centralised processing for the  Group  for  their  distribution  and  use  for  monitoring purposes; and\n- \u00b7 control  of  the  production  of  financial,  accounting  and management information including fraud prevention.\n\nThe  scope  of  application  of  the  Internal  Control  procedures relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  financial  and accounting  information  encompasses  the  parent  company L'Or\u00e9al  and  all  subsidiaries  included  in  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 protection of assets;\n\n## 3.3.2. Monitoring process for the organisation of accounting and finance functions\n\n## Organisation of the Finance Departments\n\nUnder  the  supervision  of  General  Management,  dedicated teams  of  specialists  are  responsible  for  accounting  and financial  monitoring  in  the  following  areas:  accounting, consolidation,  tax  matters,  management,  financial  services and treasury.\n\nWithin the Administration and Finance Division, the Operational Finance Department is responsible for preparing the Group's consolidated financial results. As a result, it also coordinates  the  Business  Service  Centre  and  a  worldwide network of management controllers who are responsible for ensuring  compliance  with  the  accounting  and  management standards to ensure appropriate management of the Group's results. In addition, an expert team is responsible for worldwide accounting  management,  ensuring  that  IFRS  standards  are applied,  and  that  the  Group's  accounting  processes  are implemented and harmonised worldwide and in the accounting Business Service Centre.\n\nFinally, the Operational Finance Department runs the Group's Tax  Department.  Comprising  a  network  of  tax  lawyers  at corporate level, in the Zones and in the Group's most vulnerable countries, the Tax Department monitors variations in regulations, ensures compliance with local rules, and oversees the implementation of the Group's tax policy, and in particular the transfer pricing policy and customs rules.\n\nWithin the Administration and Finance Division, the Corporate Finance  Department  protects  the  Group's  financial  assets. The  Treasury  and  Financing  Department  centralises  cash flows  and  the  hedging  of  currency  and  interest  rate  risks. The  department  leads  a  network  of  treasurers  in  the  Zones and countries, and applies the Group's financing policy.\n\nThe  Financial  Structure  Department  undertakes  external growth transactions and monitors the financial structures of L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Business  Opportunities for  L'Or\u00e9al  Development  (BOLD)  corporate  venture  fund, which makes minority investments in innovative products and companies,  is  also  managed  by  the  Corporate  Finance Department.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe Group has put in place accounting policies and standards that  are  consistent  with  IFRS,  the  consolidated  accounting standards.  All  consolidated  subsidiaries  must  apply  these standards  in  order  to  provide  uniform  and  reliable  financial information.\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  oversees  the  regular update  of  these  Group  standards,  taking  into  account  the variations in regulations and accounting principles.",

        "page_content": "These regulations define the principles required for harmonised  accounting  treatment  of  transactions,  including the  methods  used  to  record  balance  sheet  items  and  to identify  and  value  off-balance  sheet  commitments.  The Group's  Accounting  Department  conducts  the  ongoing monitoring of any new accounting standards currently under preparation,  in  order  to  alert  the  General  Management  and anticipate their effects on the Group's financial statements.\n\nCommon to all subsidiaries, the chart of accounts, along with all  the  key  accounting  processes,  provide  the  definitions  and methodology for preparing the reporting required to draw up the financial statements.\n\nThe management  standards  describe the operational application  of  these  rules.  They  give  the  valuation  rules  for some of the key balance sheet and income statement items and  also  stipulate  the  controls  and  checks  applicable  to  the key processes.\n\nThe management standards are regularly supplemented and are  thus  part  of  the  continuous  improvement  process.  This aims  to  respond  to  the  findings  of  the  Internal  Audit Department and to cover the accounting and financial risks of the  subsidiaries.  This  work  has  made  it  possible  to  bring  our approach more closely in line  with  the  recommendations  set out  in  the  'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of accounting and financial information' of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) Reference Framework.\n\n## Organisation and security of information systems\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  and  the  Global  IT Department make joint decisions about the software suitable for the Group's financial and accounting requirements. At the level  of  information  systems,  the  teams  are  strengthening the  procedures  for  the  separation  of  tasks  and  improved control  of  access  rights.  They  have  been  offered  tools  to ensure that access rights comply with the Group's rules.\n\n## Management tools\n\nThe  system  for  monthly reporting  on  economic  indicators enables  continuous,  uniform  monitoring  of  the  performance of  each  subsidiary  and  ensures  they  are  in  line  with  the objectives set.\n\nUsed  by  all  entities,  this  reporting  and  consolidation  system ensures the consistency and reliability  of  figures  at  the  level of  each  subsidiary  through  blocking  controls  that  operate before  the  financial  data  is  uploaded  to  Group  level.  In  this regard, the operating profit and loss account by destination, which  is common  to  both  management  and  general accounting,  contributes  to  strengthening  the  control  of accounts  in  the  financial  statements,  as  a  single  reference framework is used.\n\nThe  Group's  organisation  is  based  on  reporting  from  each subsidiary  that  is  provided  directly  by  the  countries  to  the parent company, L'Or\u00e9al, without any intermediate aggregates  for  the  vast  majority  of  the  subsidiaries.  This system  optimises  data  transfer  and  the  completeness  of information and facilitates verification of data accuracy.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  of each subsidiary make a joint commitment with regard to the quality,  reliability  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  and financial  information  they  have  prepared  and  sent  to  the Group's Operational Finance Department, through a representation letter that they jointly sign.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  role  and  tasks  of  the  Audit  Committee,  as  previously described, comply with European regulations and, in particular, Directive 2014/56/EU  and  EU  regulation  537/2014  on statutory audits, and are based on the report by the working group  on  Audit  Committees  published  by  the  AMF  on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.3.3. Processes used to prepare accounting and financial information\n\n## Operational processes contributing to accounting figures\n\nSpecific procedures  for  monitoring,  and  for  validation, authorisation  and  accounting  rules  apply  to  the  processes that  populate  the  financial  statements,  such  as  sales, purchases,  management  of  inventories  and  non-current assets, or payroll and cash management.\n\n## Closing of accounts, consolidation and management reporting information\n\nThe closing of accounts is governed by precise instructions and a detailed time schedule. These are circulated to all subsidiaries to make sure that deadlines are met and financial statements are prepared in a consistent manner. The Group has introduced two hard  closings  (anticipating  the  work  involved  in  the  closure  of financial  statements)  in  May  and  November  to  prepare  in advance and speed up closing times.\n\nFor  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements, validation  procedures  apply  at  each  stage  of  the  process  of reporting  and  processing  information.  In  particular,  they  verify that  inter-company  transactions  have  been  correctly  adjusted\n\nand  eliminated  (these  are  reported  on  a  monthly  basis), consolidation  transactions  have  been  checked,  accounting standards  have  been  correctly  applied,  the  consolidated published accounting and financial data have been harmonised and properly determined and the general accounting data and management  data  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial information are consistent.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nManagers  in  charge  of  Financial  Communication  prepare a precise timetable for publication of up-to-date information on the Group to the financial markets. This timetable complies with the requirements of market authorities. These managers check  with  the  Legal  Department  that  communications comply with the required deadlines, laws and regulations.\n\nThey  also  have  a  role  in  ensuring  that  the  publication  of information provided by the Operational Finance Department is  precise  and  accurate.  All  material  information  provided  to the financial community reflects with truth and transparency the situation and business activities of the Group. Furthermore,  all  communications  are  made  in  accordance with  the  principle  of  equal  provision  of  information  to  all shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Twice a year, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the consolidated  subsidiary  make  a  joint  commitment  as  to  the fair presentation, reliability and completeness of the financial information by jointly signing a representation letter.\n\nAudit assignments in the countries are almost all entrusted to members of the networks of the two Statutory Auditors who,\n\n## 3.3.4. Insurance policy\n\n## The Group's general insurance policy\n\nThe insurance policy aims to provide the best protection for the  Group's  assets  and  people  against  the  occurrence  of major  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  it.  The  Group  has implemented  group  insurance  programmes  (in  particular  for Property  Damage  &  Business  Interruption,  Third-Party Liability, Cyber, Transport, Credit Insurance and Construction) that harmonise coverage and optimise insurance cover for all its  subsidiaries  throughout  the  world,  except  in  countries where  regulations prohibits this type of arrangement (see  'Restrictions'  below).  Local  programmes  have  been  set up  in  the  countries  in  which  group  programmes  cannot  be deployed. This policy is applied as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at corporate level, the Group negotiates the structure and warranties of the group insurance programmes to cover its main exposures, in accordance with the offering available on the insurance market;\n- \u00b7 at  a  local  level,  local  policies  not  re-insured  by  a  group programme  are  deployed  in  coordination  with  the  Group; and\n- \u00b7 in all cases,  the  subsidiaries  must  have  mandatory insurance cover in order to comply with local regulations.\n\nThe  financial  solvency  of  insurers  is  an  important  selection criterion for the Group. Furthermore, the insurance programmes  subscribed  by  the  Group  mainly  involve coinsurance  between  the  various  major  players  in  the international insurance market.\n\n## Integrated group programmes\n\nGeneral  civil  liability: this  worldwide  programme  subscribed for  all  Group  subsidiaries  (except  where  local  Restrictions apply) includes, in particular, civil operational liability, product liability  and  damage  to  the  environment  that  is  sudden  and accidental.  It  covers  the  financial  consequences  of  the  civil liability of Group entities, if they are liable.\n\nafter  having  jointly  performed  the  review  of  all  the  Group's accounts  and  the  manner  in  which  they  were  prepared,  are responsible for issuing an opinion on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors issue an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent  company  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair view.  They  are  kept  informed  from  the  early  stages  of preparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  present  an overview of their work to the Group's accounting and finance managers  and  to  the  Audit  Committee  at  the  time  of  the half-year and annual closings.\n\nProperty damage and Business Interruption: this programme provides cover for fire, lightning, explosion, theft and natural events  within  the  limits  of  the  products  available  on  the insurance  market.  The  Group  has  set  up  a  worldwide programme  to  cover  all  its  property,  chiefly  non-current assets and inventories (except where Restrictions apply). This cover also includes a portion on business interruption directly resulting  from  covered  property  loss  or  damage.  As  the capacity  of  the  insurance  market  is  limited  for  certain  risks, this  programme  includes  sub-limits,  particularly  for  natural events. Through its reinsurance subsidiary, the Group carries risk retention levels that are not material at consolidated level, and  these  are  applicable  over  and  above  local  deductible amounts. The offering includes site prevention inspections by specialist departments of the leading insurer.\n\nCyber: a  cyber  insurance  policy  provides  financial  cover  for the consequences of IT-related risks, subject to exclusions and warranties  available  on  the  market.  As  it  is  a  'multi-risk' policy, cyber risk insurance comprises several components.\n\nTransport: the  Group  has  set  up  an  insurance  programme to  cover  the  transportation  of  all  its  products.  Therefore, all  subsidiaries  benefit  from  appropriate  and  uniform  cover for  risks  related  to  the  Group's  logistical  operations  (except where Restrictions apply).\n\nCustomer  credit  risk: Group  subsidiaries  must  set  up  credit insurance,  assisted  by  the  Group  and  under  the  terms  and conditions  negotiated,  in  addition  to  their  own  credit management policy, provided that insurance cover compatible with  their  level  of  sales  activity  is  available  under  financially acceptable conditions.\n\nBuildings: the  primary  aim  of  the  worldwide  Buildings insurance  programme  is  to  standardise  the  conditions  of cover for all projects, in all countries. It also makes it possible to disseminate a general Buildings insurance policy, centralised  Corporate  management  and,  lastly,  warranty optimisation.",

Introduction\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  built  on  strong  Ethical  Principles  that  guide  its development: Integrity, Respect, Courage and Transparency. These  Principles  form  the  foundation  of  its  policies  on sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and philanthropy. L'Or\u00e9al promotes respect for all internationally recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nIn line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al's particular  point  of  reference  is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  rights,  and  the Fundamental  Conventions  of  the  International  Labour Organisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance Plan (the 'Plan') meets the obligations of the French law of 27 March 2017 on the duty of vigilance for French parent companies and order-giver companies. It  contains  reasonable  due  diligence  measures  intended  to prevent the risk of serious adverse impacts on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, health, as well as safety and the environment within the framework of a best efforts obligation. It  applies  to  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  Group, and  to  the  subsidiaries  controlled  directly  or  indirectly  by L'Or\u00e9al (the 'Subsidiaries'), as defined by Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial  Code,  and  to  suppliers and subcontractors with which the companies of the Group have a 'permanent  commercial  relationship',  that  is,  a  direct, ongoing  and  stable  commercial  relationship  based  on  the\n\n## 3.4.2. A continuous improvement process\n\nAs  part  of  a  continuous  improvement  process,  the  Plan  is regularly  reviewed  by  a  committee  composed  of  the  Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department, the Operations Department  (EHS,  Purchasing),  the  Human  Resources Department, the Corporate Social Responsibility Department and  the  Legal  Department.  It  meets  several  times  a  year. Each  of  these  representatives  leads  a  local  network  (Ethics Correspondents, Environmental, Health and Safety, Purchasing,  and  Human  Relations  teams,  managers  from Internal Control, and Sustainability Leaders) around the world, making  it  possible  to  take  into  account  feedback  from  the field when improving the Plan.\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  was  presented  to  internal  stakeholders (such  as  the  employee  representatives  in  the  context  of  the European  Works  Council (Instance  Europ\u00e9enne  de  Dialogue Social) and  qualified outside stakeholders (NGOs  and members of civil society). The Audit Committee and the Board of  Directors  are  informed  each  year  of  the  update  to  the Plan's content. As part of the preparation for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Group conducted double materiality analyses of the main sustainability  risks,  impacts  and  opportunities.  These  studies enabled the Group to continue its dialogue with experts and stakeholders  on  the  potential  impacts  of  its  business  activity, specifically on  the  environment  and  human  rights  (see section 4.1.).\n\n## 3.4.3. General framework of risk analysis\n\nThe  risks of serious impacts  on  Human  Rights,  the environment,  health  and  safety,  have  been  analysed  on  the basis  of  the  business  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  its Suppliers. The risk analysis was used, first, in the definition of the  applicable  Rules  and,  second,  to  the  measures  for effective application and monitoring of these Rules.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's activity consists of production of cosmetic products and distribution of these products to the Group's clients.\n\n## 1. Manufacturing of finished products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  manufactures  the  vast  majority  of  the  finished products that it  sells  in  its  own  factories,  with  a  presence  in the  major  growth  markets.  Its  network  of  37  factories  is equipped  with  the  very  latest  technologies  and  advances  in automation  and  adapts  constantly,  and  with  agility,  to incorporate acquisitions and embrace external innovations.\n\ndefinition  in  French  case  law  (the  'Suppliers'),  depending  on the risk level as identified in the Plan. It is understood that in its own  activities,  L'Or\u00e9al  complies  with  the  rules  and diligences  contained  in  the  Plan,  even  when  L'Or\u00e9al  is  not expressly  mentioned  therein.  The  Plan  contains  the  rules applied  to  prevent  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  impacts  on Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  health  and safety  of  people  and  the  environment  resulting  from  the activities  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  (see subsection 3.4.4.). It also includes reasonable measures for the effective application of these rules by L'Or\u00e9al, its Subsidiaries and  Suppliers  as  well  as  regular  assessment  procedures  to evaluate their compliance (see subsection 3.4.5.). It provides a whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system (see subsection  3.4.6.)  and  presents  a  report  on  the  plan's implementation (see subsection 3.4.7.). The actions to support, encourage  and  prevent  serious  adverse  Human  Rights, Fundamental Freedoms, health,  safety  and  the  environment contained  in  the  Plan  constitute  reasonable  efforts  to  be implemented by Suppliers and Subsidiaries. Given the diversity of  the  businesses of the Subsidiaries and Suppliers, the Plan contains common measures for them.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  common  measures,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its Subsidiaries  voluntarily  conduct  additional  actions  on  these same issues. These initiatives are described in other chapters, in particular chapter 4. Suppliers voluntarily conduct additional  actions  on  these  issues  and  L'Or\u00e9al  encourages them to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nVigilance Plan\n\nThis  network  is  completed  by  production  subcontracting, to  meet  temporary  demand  peaks  in  the  case  of  specific technologies (make-up pencils, soaps etc.). L'Or\u00e9al's contracts prohibit  cascade  subcontracting.  L'Or\u00e9al's  consent  must  be obtained by subcontractors, who  need,  as  result of manufacturing constraints,  to  subcontract  a  portion  of  their L'Or\u00e9al production. When, in certain cases, the subcontractor is authorised  to  subcontract  a  portion  of  its  production, the  same  rules  as  those  defined  in  this  Plan  are  applied  to the  subcontractors  of  the  subcontractors.  The  same  types of controls and sanctions are in place in the event of non-compliance.\n\nIn order to execute their production, L'Or\u00e9al's factories purchase different  raw  materials,  filling  and  packaging  articles  and equipment  from  third-party  suppliers.  These  suppliers  have specific expertise, develop  their products  and  have  the infrastructures  necessary  for  their  production.  They  act  with complete  independence  from  L'Or\u00e9al,  without  depending on L'Or\u00e9al's instructions or expertise.\n\nThe manufacture of filling and packaging articles is not part of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activity (1) .  The  filling  and  packaging  articles  used are  purchased  from  companies  specialising  in  this  area.  The same is true for the production equipment.\n\n## 2. Product distribution\n\nProducts are distributed by the Subsidiaries and independent third-party distributors in the countries or regions where the Subsidiaries  are  not  present.  In  order  to  ensure  this distribution,  warehouses  are  operated  by  the  Subsidiaries directly, or these services are entrusted to third-party logistics service  providers  that  render  services  on  the  same  type  of activity: storage and preparation of orders in warehouses that they lease or own.\n\n## 3.4.4. Applicable rules resulting from the risk analysis\n\nThe  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  comply  with  the applicable local legislation and the minimum common core of the  rules  listed  below  (the  'Applicable  Rules')  in  order  to prevent the risk of serious adverse impacts on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment. When local laws and/or the internal rules of Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  provide  more  stringent  standards than  the  Applicable  Rules,  such  standards  must  take precedence.  If,  however,  the  Applicable  Rules  provide  for stricter  standards,  the  Applicable  Rules  take  precedence unless  they  result  in  an  unlawful  activity.  In  the  event  of contradictions between local laws and internationally recognised Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al works to comply with these international standards.\n\n## 3.4.4.1. Risks and Applicable Rules for the prevention of serious violations of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\n## Risk Analysis and risks identified relating to Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nThe Group expanded its mapping by identifying the potential key Human Rights risks worldwide and in all markets. L'Or\u00e9al relied on the reporting framework of the Guiding Principles on Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP  Reporting  Framework). This  identification  process  takes  into  consideration  the severity, scale and remediability, as well as the likelihood of its impacts for people throughout its value chain. This study was conducted with an NGO specialised in the area, providing an independent analysis, and was reviewed by different external stakeholders. As a result of this analysis, the following salient risks  were  identified  in  the  context  of  the  application  of  the French Law on Duty of Vigilance:\n\n- \u00b7 child labour among the employees of the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 forced  labour  among  the  employees  of  the  Group's Suppliers;\n\n- \u00b7 job discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation of the employees of L'Or\u00e9al and the employees of the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 a  lack  of  decent  living  wage (2) for  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 a  lack  of  workervoice  mechanisms  for  social  dialogue, freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining  among the employees of the Group's Suppliers.\n\nOther  potential  risks  identified  concern  respect  for  the environment,  the  right  to  access  water,  consideration  of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials and, in particular, respect  for  free,  prior  and  informed  consent  of  indigenous peoples.\n\n## Applicable rules on Human Rights\n\nSubsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  comply  with  the  minimum core rules, which consist of the following rules that result from an analysis of the risks related to the business activities of the Group and its Suppliers.\n\nNon-discrimination: Acts of discrimination are serious violations of Human Rights that remain anchored in all regions of  the  world  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al  is  present.  Discrimination related  to  gender,  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity, disabilities,  family  situation,  age,  political  and  philosophical opinions, religious beliefs, union activities, or related to ethnic, social, cultural or national origins or pregnancy are prohibited. L'Or\u00e9al  bans  pregnancy  testing  when  employees  are  hired within the Group, and requires its Suppliers to comply with this standard.\n\nBullying and sexual harassment: Bullying and sexual harassment are prohibited in the Group.\n\nChild labour: L'Or\u00e9al's presence in certain regions of the world that are particularly at risk for child labour, including Asia and Latin  America,  has  led  the  Group  to  identify  this  issue  as  a priority.  To  take  into  consideration  the  vulnerability  of  young workers, L'Or\u00e9al has set the minimum hiring age at 16 years old. L'Or\u00e9al prohibits night work and work hazardous to health and safety for employees younger than 18 in its Subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "Forced or compulsory labour: L'Or\u00e9al refers to the definition of forced labour set out in Convention 29 of the International Labour  Organization:  'all  work  or  service  which  is  exacted from  any  person  under  the  menace  of  any  penalty  and  for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily'. In certain  regions  of  the  world  where  L'Or\u00e9al  operates,  certain practices  that  violate  internationally  recognised  Human Rights, such as holding the identity papers of migrant workers, are  common.  Any  form  of  forced  labour  is  prohibited.  As  a result:\n\n- \u00b7 unless  there  is  a  legal  obligation,  employees'  identity papers,  passports  or  any  other  personal  documents  may not  be  held  from  them.  In  the  event  of  a  legal  obligation, these  documents  must  be  returned  to  employees  at  their first request;\n- \u00b7 employees may not be asked to pay for recruitment costs or to make cash deposits to obtain employment;\n- \u00b7 if  workers  from  foreign  regions  are  hired,  the  employer must pay the costs related to these hires;\n- \u00b7 the use of prison labour is possible only when it is voluntary within  the  scope  of  a  professional  reinsertion  programme, and  paid  at  the  market  rate.  Suppliers  must  request authorisation  from  L'Or\u00e9al  before  they  use  this  type  of labour;\n- \u00b7 security  personnel  must  only  ensure  the  safety  of  people and property; and\n- \u00b7 any salary withholding must be strictly authorised by law. It may not under any circumstances be used for the purpose of  confiscation,  for  the  direct  or  indirect  benefit  of  the employer.\n\nEmployees  must  have  access  to  drinking  water  and  toilet facilities.  They  must  be  free  to  move  around  their  place  of work, with the exception of areas to which access is restricted for confidentiality or safety reasons.\n\nWorking  hours: Working  hours,  including  overtime,  may  not exceed 60 hours a week for employees whose working time is monitored.  All  employees  must  also  be  granted  at  least  one day  of  rest  for  every  seven-day  period,  or  two  consecutive days  of  rest  for  every  fourteen-day  period.  They  must  have reasonable breaks when they work.\n\nFreedom  of  association  and  right  to  collective  bargaining: Violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, such as discrimination against employee representatives, may occur in all regions of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al  operates.  Employees'  freedom  of  association  and right to collective bargaining must be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 elections  of  employee  representatives  must  take  place without  interference  from  the  employer,  preferably  by secret ballot;\n- \u00b7 employee  representatives  have  access  to  the  work premises subject to safety and/or confidentiality requirements, if any; and\n- \u00b7 discrimination against employees conducting union activities is prohibited.\n\nIn  regions  where  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining  are  limited  or  discouraged,  L'Or\u00e9al authorises  its  employees  to  meet  independently  in  order  to discuss their professional concerns.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\n## Additional actions for Human Rights\n\nIn addition to the action taken as a result of the risk analysis conducted  on  the  business  activities  of  the  Group  and  its Suppliers,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts  initiatives  in  addition  to  those implemented  under  the  French  law  on  Duty  of  Vigilance. These are described in chapter 4.\n\nFor example, L'Or\u00e9al set up actions with the aim to improve the  working  conditions  of  the  Indian  communities  whose livelihood  depends  on  the  mineral  mica.  Since  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al has been one of the 20 founding members of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI). This year, the RMI has 97 members. The RMI has three goals:\n\n- \u00b7 implement  standards  on  the  responsible  workplace  on 100%  of  the  supply  chains  of  its  members  for  mica  from Bihar  and  Jharkhand  (standards  on  employment,  health, safety  in  the  workplace,  the  environment  and  non-use  of child labour);\n- \u00b7 support  the  abilities  of  communities  through  an  inclusive programme  that  improves  the  standard  of  living  and generates additional sources of income; and\n- \u00b7 establish  a  legal  framework  and  related  control  systems with  mica  pickers,  processing  units,  and  mica  operators  in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also participates in the development of the RMI audit standard  in  order  to  facilitate  member  collaboration  and effectively deploy the collective actions necessary in cooperation  with  local  authorities.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  supports  the establishment  of  a  price  calculated  using  the  living  wage (1) approach  in  addition  to  diversified  income  contributing  to  a more resilient living conditions.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  requires  its  Suppliers  to  have  their  own due  diligence processes in place as regards their own scope of supply of Indian mica.  In  2022,  99%  of  Indian  mica  used  in  the  Group's  formulas came  from  suppliers  committed  to  obtaining  their  supply  from verified sources.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  two  ambitious  programmes  aimed at  improving  working  conditions  for  the  employees  and communities our suppliers use: the Living Wage and Inclusive Sourcing programmes.\n\n## The Living Wage programme\n\nIn  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  awarded  the Living  Wage  Employer accreditation by Fair Wage Network, an international NGO, in recognition  of  its  worldwide  status  as  a  committed  Living Wage Employer.\n\nIn line with its commitment to fair pay for all of its employees, L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  aims  to  ensure  that,  by  2030,  all employees of L'Or\u00e9al's strategic suppliers will be paid at least a living wage, in line with best practices.\n\nIn  order  to  roll  out  this  approach  to  its  strategic  suppliers, L'Or\u00e9al  initiates  dialogue,  works  together  and  establishes common strategic frameworks, in collaboration with partners within  its  supply  chains,  other  companies,  civil  society, governments etc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2023, L'Or\u00e9al launched a programme aimed at explaining the  principle  of  a  living  wage  to  its  strategic  suppliers  and sharing  information  on  the  adoption  of  a  living  wage approach.  The  programme  consists  of  a  series  of  meetings over several months with a group of suppliers, the Fair Wage Network  and  L'Or\u00e9al  in  attendance.  The  purpose  of  these meetings  was  to  discuss  the  strategy  and  methodology,  as well as to hear from the suppliers that were furthest forward in  the  process.  This  encourages  companies  to  share  best practices  and  any  difficulties.  The  suppliers  are  invited  to make commitments via a living wage pledge.\n\nIn  2023,  more  than  115  suppliers  benefitted  from  individual support and more than 50 suppliers pledged to be compliant by 2030.\n\n## The Inclusive Sourcing programme (1)\n\nThrough  its  Inclusive  Sourcing  programme,  established  in 2010,  due  to  its  many  industrial  and  administrative  sites  all over  the  world,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  heavily  involved  in  the  life  of  local communities  and  in  the  areas  neighbouring  its  sites  and suppliers.\n\nThe programme aims to use the Group's purchasing power to serve  social  inclusion  by  dedicating  part  of  its  purchases  to suppliers providing access to work and a sustainable income for  people  who  are  generally  excluded  from  the  labour market, economically vulnerable communities, including small businesses  and  those  that  have  trouble  accessing  major contractors.\n\nThe programme concerns all the Group's suppliers and values their  commitment  to  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion.  The Inclusive  Sourcing  programme  concerns,  for  example:  fair trade  producers,  companies  which  employ  people  with disabilities,  social  insertion  enterprises,  or  companies  owned by minorities (2) (when this is permitted by national legislation).\n\nInclusive Sourcing helps to achieve L'Or\u00e9al's goal of enabling 100,000  additional  people  who  are  socially  or  economically vulnerable to access employment by 2030.\n\n## Measures to improve the working conditions of beauty advisors\n\nL'Or\u00e9al works with beauty advisors to promote its products at points  of  sale.  Depending  on  the  markets,  they  may  be L'Or\u00e9al employees, distributor employees or employees hired through  temporary  employment  agencies.  Predominantly women, these advisors are in direct contact with consumers and may sometimes be faced with consumer or management behaviour that does not reflect L'Or\u00e9al's values. To improve their  access  to  reporting  tools,  the  Group  has  launched  pilot projects in three markets.\n\nFor  example,  a  mobile  phone  survey  tool  has  been  deployed for all beauty advisors employed by a temporary employment agency  as  part  of  a  pilot  in  a  Group  country.  This  revealed human rights issues, concerning working conditions, employment  contracts  and  harassment,  in  particular.  These topics  were  addressed  in  a  dedicated  action  plan  that included measures to improve contracts and to train beauty advisors,  distributors  and  employers  of  these  advisors  on violence against women.\n\nOther similar feedback tool projects are being considered, as the  ultimate  goal  is  to  increase  the  coverage  of  this  at-risk population.\n\n## 3.4.4.2. Risks and Applicable Rules to prevent serious adverse impacts on Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\n## Analysis of Risks to Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\nThe  risk  analysis  covers  generic  risks  related  to  industrial activities and  specific risks related to Suppliers' and Subsidiaries' own business activities.\n\n## Generic risk analysis process\n\nAs  is  the  case  for  any  production  (manufacturing  and packing),  distribution,  research  and  general  administration operations, the Group and its Suppliers are exposed to safety and environmental challenges.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work on the Environment, Health and Safety at the workplace carried out by L'Or\u00e9al for many years,  the  major  risks  below  have  been  identified.  On  this basis,  the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  define  at  each  of their  sites,  the  measures  designed  to  prevent  the  risks identified in the Plan (the 'Prevention System').\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Subsidiaries\n\nThe Subsidiaries conduct their own risk analysis based on the list of risks set out below, particularly the fire risk is controlled by very strict fire prevention standards (such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  generic  risks,  the  Subsidiaries  identify  the specific  risks  related  in  particular  to  cosmetics  production. For  example,  the  physical  risks  are  the  subject  of  SHAP (Safety  Hazards  Assessment  Procedure)  studies,  which identify  the  dangers,  generally  and  for  each  workstation, assess  the  risks  and  allow  the  implementation  of  the necessary  means  of  control.  Environmental  risks  are  also analysed to assess the nature of the aspects and impacts of a site's  activities  on  its  environment  and  to  control  any  that lead  to  potentially  serious  impacts  for  the  air,  soil,  water, biodiversity and resources.\n\nThis  environmental  analysis  is  updated  regularly  by  each  of the  Group  Subsidiaries'  sites  and  whenever  a  significant change  takes  place.  If  significant  risks  are  identified  or  if L'Or\u00e9al's standards or regulations impose specific requirements, a more detailed evaluation is carried out for the activities concerned. Appropriate action plans -with immediate  action  where  necessary  -  are  implemented  to reduce significant risks to an acceptable level.\n\nWith  regard  to  water  discharge,  each  industrial  site  has implemented  a  self-monitoring  system  representative  of  the wastewater  discharged (3) .  This  self-monitoring  is  a  tool  for detecting risks of exceeding regulatory thresholds that helps to  anticipate  any  non-conformities  and  initiate  corrective actions.  A  total  of  30  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  have  their  own wastewater  treatment  plant.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  continuing  with  the installation of these plants.",

        "page_content": "The  process  safety  risks  are  analysed  using  the  HAZOP (HAZard and OPerability analysis) guide. This method focuses on  operating  conditions,  or  FMECA (1) ,  which  analyses  risks related  to  failures  in  the  process  at  the  different  steps  in production.\n\nThe  results  and  means  of  controlling  industrial  and  specific risks are summarised in the GHAP  (Global Hazard Assessment Procedure) programme.\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Suppliers\n\nIn addition to their own risk analysis, Suppliers rely, at the very least, on the risks listed in the audit grid provided by L'Or\u00e9al when  the  Letter  of  Mutual  Ethical  Commitment  is  signed (see  subparagraph  4.3.1.2.1.)  to  implement  the  appropriate prevention  measures  at  each  affected  site.  This  grid  was prepared  in  accordance  with  the  list  of  the  major  risks described below and is applied during referencing and followup audits.\n\nIf the  specific  nature  of  the  Suppliers'  activity  requires identification  of  specific  risks  and/or  additional  prevention measures,  the  Suppliers  are  required  to  roll  out  these additional measures in accordance with best practices in their industry.\n\nFor  example,  in  the  subcontracting  of  finished  products activity,  specific  risks  may  involve  (i)  the  use  of  certain  raw materials, (ii) wastewater treatment, (iii) the use of machines or  electrical  equipment  in  processing  or  storage  areas, and (iv)  handling  techniques  that  may  cause  personal  injury, in particular.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  subcontracting  suppliers  of  aerosol production or storage, bleaching powders, flammable products,  the  sites  are  subject  to  specific  risks  analyses concerning process safety.\n\n## Risks identified in the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n## Risks of serious adverse impacts to Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n- (i) Risks associated with buildings and the use of equipment:\n- \u00b7 soundness  of  buildings  (construction  and  interior fittings,  including  the  compliance  of  equipment  with operating authorisations and building permits issued by local  authorities  in  compliance  with  the  applicable legislation and, in any event, adaptation to the activity for which the buildings are intended);\n- \u00b7 use of motorised forklift trucks and Automatic Guided Vehicles  (AGV):  risks  caused  by  interactions  and interference between forklift trucks, AGVs  and pedestrians; and\n- \u00b7 injuries  caused  by  interactions  between  humans  and machines: risks related to access to the moving parts of work equipment.\n- (ii) Risks related to energy sources, matter and materials:\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  energy  sources,  fluids  and  hazardous emissions  including  electricity,  high  pressure,  steam, vapour, hot water and high temperatures;\n- \u00b7 fires  resulting,  notably,  from  flammable  products  and materials or electrical equipment;\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  hazardous  dust  and  chemical  products: by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to high noise levels.\n\n(iii) Risks related to human activities:\n\n- \u00b7 entry in confined spaces and/or the risk of anoxia;\n- \u00b7 isolated  work:  risks  associated  with  working  alone  for long periods of time;\n- \u00b7 slipping and falls;\n- \u00b7 ergonomics of workstations related to load handling;\n- \u00b7 construction works (risks during construction activities); and\n- \u00b7 work at heights (risk of falls associated with the use of ladders  and  step  stools,  access  to  and  work  on platforms and roofs, use of lift tables and scaffolding etc.).\n\n## Environmental risks\n\nThe  risks  of  serious  damage  to  the  environment  are  those associated  with  the  consumption  of  resources  or  that  could cause  damage  to  soils,  water,  air  and  biodiversity  (habitats and  species)  in  the  context  of  normal  operation  or  the occurrence  of  an  incident  at  a  site  of  the  Subsidiaries  or Suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 gradual or accidental pollution; and\n- \u00b7 pollution during the transport of hazardous materials.\n\n## Applicable rules to prevent risks of serious adverse impacts on Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\n## EHS Guidelines\n\nThe  Group's  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  policy aims  to  minimise  the  impact  on  the  environment  and guarantee  the  health  and  safety  of  the  employees  of  its Subsidiaries and Suppliers, its customers and the communities in which L'Or\u00e9al carries out its activities. For the Subsidiaries, this policy is built on an EHS management system composed of  standards  with  stringent  requirements  that  set  the principles  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS  policy,  which  is  all  included  in  the EHS guidelines.\n\n## Additional Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace actions\n\nIn addition to the action taken as a result of the risk analysis conducted  on  the  business  activities  of  the  Group  and  its Suppliers, L'Or\u00e9al conducts Environmental Health and Safety in  the  Workplace initiatives in addition to those implemented under  the  French  law  on  Duty  of  Vigilance.  These  are described in chapter 4.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  in the  workplace  is  supported  at  the  highest  level  of  the Company by its Chief Executive Officer who renews L'Or\u00e9al's commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  each year.\n\nFor example, this includes the following additional actions and commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 in  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al was one of 100 leading companies to join the Science Based Targets programme;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  extends  the  ambition of moving  towards  'zero  accidents'  by  ensuring  the sustainability of actions and defining post-incident emergency preparedness requirements.\n\nThe Sharing Beauty with All programme has helped to reduce the  environmental  footprint  of  the  Group's  sites:  between 2005  and  2020,  our  factories  and  distribution  centres reduced their CO2 emissions by -81% (in absolute value), their water withdrawal by -49% (1) ,  and their waste generation by 37% (1) .\n\nThe commitments made by the Group for 2030 as part of its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  are  aimed  at  ensuring compatibility of the Group's activities with a planet that has limited resources (2) .  The main environmental objectives of the programme concerning Subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate:  by  2025,  reach  100%  renewable  energy  at  all operated  sites (3) .  L'Or\u00e9al  is  also  committed  to  halving  the transport footprint of its products by 2030;\n- \u00b7 Water:  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be recycled and reused;\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity: by 2030, all of our operated buildings and all industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared  to  2019.  A  methodology  for  monitoring  the Biodiversity commitment was developed in 2021 and rolled out  to  all  of  the  Group's  sites  in  2022.  Becoming 'biodiversity  net  positive'  is  achieved  by  meeting  two conditions:  the  first  is  improving  the  potential  for  hosting biodiversity on the Group's sites, the second concerns developing the biodiversity culture of employees; and\n- \u00b7 Natural resources: by 2030, 100% of the waste generated in  our  operated  sites  will  be  recycled  or  reused.  L'Or\u00e9al  is also committed to no longer send waste to landfills.\n\nThese  objectives  are  accompanied  by  monthly  reporting  of detailed indicators used to monitor variations in results in each of  these  areas  and  to  identify  potential  anomalies  and incidents.  This  reporting  is  also  accompanied  by  an  annual programme  to  coordinate  environmental  projects,  running until  2030,  which  allows  objectives  to  be  set  at  site  level. These projects are evaluated and prioritised in order to ensure that  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  objectives  are  reached.  The objectives,  which  are  defined  annually  and  linked  to  the monthly reporting, make it possible to assess the performance of  each  site,  country  and  zone.  A  summary  of  the  results obtained is provided in subsection 3.4.7.\n\nThe Group is engaged  in a process of continuous improvement of its EHS performance through a programme to  achieve  ISO  certification  for  its  operated  sites,  in  order to anchor the EHS policy in the long term: ISO 45001 for the management of employee health and safety and improvement  in  their  working  conditions;  ISO  14001  for  the management  of  environmental  impacts  and  improvement in  environmental  performance;  and  ISO  50001  for  energy management and energy performance improvement.\n\n'Culture'  audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS  specialists to assess the degree to which EHS culture has been rolled out to  all  Subsidiary  employees.  The  results  of  these  audits provide  information  on  the  level  of  knowledge  of  EHS management  tools  and  the  maturity  of  audited  sites  with regard to the safety and environment culture at all levels of the hierarchy.\n\nRegular checks are carried out at sites operated by the Group to ensure that cooling gas, which is used for the production of cold (e.g. refrigeration units) and heat (e.g. heat pumps), have not  leaked.  A  risk  reduction  strategy  has  been  implemented following  a  comprehensive  inventory  of  facilities  that  use cooling gas at sites. It  is  based  on  two  pillars:  detecting  and managing leaks  and  replacing  traditional  cooling  gases  with alternative  cooling  gases  with  low  global  warming  potential (or GWP).\n\nDetailed  information  on  these  additional  actions  is  available in chapter 4.\n\n## (ii) Additional actions intended for Suppliers\n\nThe Purchasing teams select the most competitive suppliers and  in  accordance  with  the  responsible  purchasing  policy. Suppliers' EHS  assessment  is  managed  by  monitoring indicators  included  in  the  corporate  social  responsibility criterion,  which  is  one  of  the  five  criteria  for  monitoring supplier performance.\n\nAs  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  launched in  2020 with targets for 2030, the Group has broadened its environmental  commitments  to  its  suppliers.  The  main environmental  objectives  of  the  programme  concerning suppliers  or  those  that  may  be  related  to  their  business activity are therefore as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate: by 2030, strategic suppliers will reduce their direct greenhouse  gas  emissions  (scopes  1  and  2)  by  50%  in absolute terms compared to 2016.\n- The Group has defined a methodology to engage suppliers based on their emissions contributions and to manage their emissions performance with them.\n\nThis methodology, which is being gradually implemented, is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 their commitment to CDP Supply Chain;\n- \u00b7 their emissions contributions;\n- \u00b7 the reliability of their reported data, which is checked by monitoring the verification conducted by a third party;\n- \u00b7 the  adoption  of  ambitious  targets  and  the  launch  of associated action plans; and\n- \u00b7 the alignment of their trajectory with the Science Based Targets initiative.",

L'Or\u00e9al developed the Sustainable  Palm  Index  (SPI),  a  tool  to  evaluate  and  select suppliers of palm oil and palm kernel derivatives to assess the level of commitment, progress and achievements of its direct suppliers  in  favour  of  sustainable  palm  oil.  This  tool  is  used annually  to  evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  Zero Deforestation objective and their level of compliance with the Group's requirements.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Group conducted a regional analysis of the Human Rights risk in Indonesia, one of the world's leading producers. This analysis confirmed  that  Human  Rights violations largely coincide with the areas that are most at risk of deforestation.  In  2023,  three  human  rights  assessments  were conducted on the ground at palm oil plantations in Indonesia, following  a  specific  approach  to  take  into  account  gender violence.  Action  plans  were  implemented  at  the  plantations where  practices  were  identified  as  non-compliant  (mainly discrimination, recruitment and employment contracts).\n\nThe  specific  feature  of  the  SPI  lies  in  its  integration  in  the purchasing decision process. A supplier in compliance with the SPI  will  benefit  from  an  allocation  of  volumes,  long-term contracts, and will be favoured in the context of partnerships in land projects.\n\nIn 2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  co-founded  the  collective  Action  for Sustainable Derivatives initiative in order to share knowledge and  methods  with  other  operators  to  encourage  the production  and  responsible  supply  of  palm  oil  derivatives. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to managing, preserving and rehabilitating forests, prioritising forestry ecosystems that are of  primary  strategic  interest  to  the  Group.  The  Group  has drawn  up  a  Forestry  Policy  for  2030,  which  enshrines  its ambition  and  sets  out  the  objectives  associated  with  the sustainable supply of forest-based materials.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  ensures  compliance  among  its  direct  and  indirect suppliers  by  applying  due  diligence  procedures,  including  a geospatial monitoring tool, community monitoring and checks conducted by a third party. Nusantara Atlas is used to carry out  risk  assessments  at  province  and  district  level,  and  the Global Forest Watch Palm Risk Tool is used to conduct them at plant level. Since 2019, L'Or\u00e9al has been working with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Transitions to develop\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\na new add-on for the SPOTT platform to assess the level to which  mills  and  refineries  comply  with  the  NDPE  (No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation) principles (1) .  For its projects involving small operators in Indonesia, L'Or\u00e9al uses specific deforestation surveillance systems to ensure compliance  with  NDPE.  Furthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  continually monitors complaints made throughout its supply chain using a 'palm alert procedure'.\n\nFaced with an identified human rights risk, L'Or\u00e9al joined the 'Harvesting  the  Future'  project  launched  by  the  Fair  Labor Association,  which  was  extended  in  January  2023  to  cover the rose sector in Turkey for an initial period of two years until December  2024.  The  project  aims  to  improve  working conditions and respect for human rights in the rose sector in Turkey, focusing on empowering seasonal agricultural workers and their families.\n\nThe project brings together various stakeholders, including the Turkish  government,  civil  society  organisations,  processors, producers and companies in the beauty and fragrance sector, in order  to  support  and  empower  these  companies  in establishing  a  human  rights  vigilance  system  in  their  supply chains. It also strengthens  the  relationship  with  local stakeholders.\n\nFor  other  streams  of  renewable  raw  materials,  which represent 22% of the portfolio of renewable raw materials in volume and 87% in number, L'Or\u00e9al has defined 'sustainable sourcing challenges' indicators to assess the sustainability of renewable  raw  material  streams.  These  indicators  were defined  using  environmental,  social  and  economic  indicators from external databases (2) .\n\nThese indicators are consolidated within the SCAN (Sustainable  Characterisation)  index,  allowing  the  Group  to prioritise the implementation of its sustainable sourcing action plans. The Group updates the information collected regularly. 70% of the volume of raw materials that the SCAN index has identified as representing sustainable sourcing challenges (i.e. 60% of the number of raw materials) are already the subject of plans or improvement initiatives with the relevant suppliers to  ensure  sustainable  supply.  The  goal  is  for  100%  of  the Group's  renewable  raw  materials  to  come  from  sustainable sources.\n\nTo  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  support  and  learning programme  for  more  than  200  suppliers  on  the  issues  of sustainable  sourcing  of  raw  materials  in  order  to  guarantee the traceability of the raw materials delivered to L'Or\u00e9al and ensure the associated streams are secure. Depending on the level  of  environmental  and/or  social  risk  identified  on  these streams,  suppliers  are  asked  to  deploy  the  field  audit procedure for producers (88 indicators). This procedure was developed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  with  the  support  of  the  Rainforest Alliance  NGO  and  reviewed  in  2019  by  EcoCert,  The Biodiversity Consultancy and The Danish Institute for Human Rights.  They  are  also  invited  to  rely  on  sustainable  sourcing certifications  adapted  to  the  challenges  of  their  streams (Fair Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recycling  helps  to  reduce  CO2 emissions associated with the production of virgin plastic and to improve waste management by preventing litter, as plastics are  collected  and  sorted  for  recycling.  To  this  end,  L'Or\u00e9al promotes the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives in countries in which this sector is underdeveloped.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has had a health and safety policy for the materials used in its packaging for 20 years. It specifies the conditions for  acceptance  or  rejection  of  substances  that  may  be present  in  our  packaging,  regardless  of  the  material.  This policy is updated annually in line with regulatory developments and  scientific  progress,  and  each  supplier  agrees  to  fully comply  with  regard  to  the  packaging  used  in  the  Group's products. Quality auditing is carried out to ensure compliance.\n\nThe Group has begun working on this value chain, particularly with  suppliers  of  plastic  packaging  and  recycled  plastics,  by involving  them  in  analysing  and  mitigating  upstream  social risks.  All  recycled  plastic  producers  used  by  the  Group's packaging  suppliers  undertake  to  comply  with  the  Group's standards and commit to this by signing the Letter of Mutual Ethical  Commitment.  A  social  audit  is  carried  out  at  each recycled plastic supplier factory located in a high-risk country. A conforming social audit is a prerequisite for any commercial relationship  between  recycled  plastic  suppliers  and  the Group's  plastic  packaging  suppliers.  Conscious  of  the  fact that transforming the sector requires the cooperation of all of its  stakeholders,  including  suppliers  of  plastic  packaging, recycled plastics and other end products, the Group maintains an  active  dialogue  with  numerous  stakeholders  in  order  to shift the industry towards responsible sourcing.\n\nOnce  sources  have  been  analysed,  social  audits  are conducted  at  recycling  sites  based  in  high-risk  countries  in accordance with the Group's social audit procedure.\n\nA  \u20ac50  million  impact  fund  (the  Circular  Innovation  Fund)  is dedicated to waste management and the circular economy as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future commitments.\n\n- \u00b7 Commitment of suppliers to self-assess and move forward with action plans through CDP.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al actively works with its suppliers to help them improve their performance in terms of sustainability.\n\nIn  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  CDP  supply  chain  programme  for greater  transparency  in  the  actions  of  its  suppliers  and  to monitor the progress made in relation to L'Or\u00e9al's objectives. In  2014, participation in CDP Climate programme was made compulsory by L'Or\u00e9al for all strategic suppliers. The aim is to measure and report their emissions, set targets for reducing these  emissions  and  communicate  their  action  plans  to achieve this objective successfully. In 2023, 95% of strategic suppliers  completed  the  climate  questionnaire.  76%  of selected  suppliers  completed  the  water  questionnaire  and 73%  of  those  selected  for  the  sustainable  management  of forestry questionnaire responded.\n\n- \u00b7 Supplier  commitment  to  self-assess  and  improve  with corrective actions recommended by EcoVadis: By participating in the EcoVadis assessment, L'Or\u00e9al compares  its  environmental  and  social  policy  with  the expertise  and  the  recommendations  of  external  auditors qualified in the analysis of multi-sector risks. This is a useful rating  for  the  continuous  improvement  of  suppliers  and  it also contributes to the transparency of industry practices. This assessment is used to select suppliers by taking their environmental  and  social  performance  into  consideration. 95% of strategic suppliers were evaluated by EcoVadis.",

Effective application and compliance with the Plan\n\nThe Plan includes effective application measures intended to ensure  the  correct  implementation  of  the  Applicable  Rules by  the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers.  Monitoring  of  compliance with  the  Plan  is  carried  out  through  audits  and  analyses performed by external service  providers  or  by  Group  teams. The  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  are  asked  to  carry  out self-assessments.\n\n## 3.4.5.1. Effective application of the Plan\n\n## Adoption of Applicable Rules\n\n## (i) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries\n\nThe effective implementation of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries  is  achieved  through  their  incorporation  in  the Group's Internal Rules. For this purpose, compliance with the effective application of the Plan is based on control activities in accordance with the applicable legislation. The communication  of  Applicable  Rules  to  Group  employees  is described  below.  Social  audits  are  conducted  at  the  Group subsidiaries' industrial sites by a third-party company for the purpose of verifying that the Applicable Rules are implemented correctly.\n\n## (ii) Adoption of the Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\nSuppliers undertake to comply with the Applicable Rules. The principal Suppliers sign the Letter of Ethical Commitment that covers  these  applicable  Rules.  Moreover,  the  Suppliers  that could  present  the  most  significant  risks  because  of  their activity or geographic location may be audited on these issues in accordance with the Risk Matrix. The contents of the points that will be audited is set forth in the letter.\n\n## Governance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people in the workplace and the environment is supported at the highest level of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer who renews L'Or\u00e9al's commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  each year. These commitments are also set out in the Group's Code of Ethics and the Human Rights and Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\n## (i) Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms governance\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, a member of the Executive  Committee,  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the respect  of  Human  Rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  in  the Group.  This  mission  has  been  entrusted  to  her  by  L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer has a budget and a dedicated team of Human Rights experts. She relies on all the Group's teams and resources to carry out her work.\n\nA  dedicated  network  of  Human  Rights  Correspondents covering  all  of  the  Group's  markets  allows  the  Group's commitments in terms of Human Rights to be rolled out.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee, chaired by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and composed of representatives of the various  activities,  functions  and  geographic  areas  (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security etc.), allows coordination and  exchange  on  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  Human Rights policy. Its primary objective is to enable the emergence of a Human Rights culture within the Group.\n\nCountry  Managers  (or,  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report)  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Human Relations teams are responsible for ensuring that the  activities  of  the  Subsidiaries  respect  employees'  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nEmployees may contact their manager, their Human Relations Director, their Legal Director, their Purchasing Director, their Human  Rights  Correspondent,  their  Ethics  Correspondent and, ultimately, the Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer if they  have  any  questions  about  compliance  with  the Applicable Rules\n\nThe Purchasing teams ensure that Supplier activities respect Human Rights and fundamental freedoms. Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix are not listed in L'Or\u00e9al's Supplier database until  they  have  contractually  committed  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules. Purchasing teams discuss, during Management Committee meetings that include representatives from all Zones and purchasing areas, the results of audits, their consequences for commercial relations, and the related actions plans to achieve continuous improvement of results at the Group's Suppliers.\n\n## (ii)  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  in  the  workplace governance\n\nThe Chief Operations Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer  and  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee,  is responsible for the general policy to prevent serious adverse impacts  on  the  environment,  and  health  and  safety.  The implementation  of  this  policy  is  the  responsibility  of  the Group's  Subsidiaries  and  Group  Sites.  The  Chief  Operations Officer  is  supported  by  and  delegates  the  deployment  and monitoring of the policy to:\n\n- \u00b7 factory and distribution centre Directors who are responsible for the deployment and effective implementation of the policies defined by the Group. Their remuneration  is  partly  linked  to  their  performance  in  the areas  of  the  environment,  health  and  safety  in  the workplace;\n- \u00b7 EHS  managers  who  are  trained  and  dedicated  to compliance  with  the  EHS  policy.  They  are  responsible for deploying the rules, procedures  and  associated performance  objectives  of  the  Group  in  all  of  its  entities; and\n- \u00b7 country  Operations  Directors  who  are  responsible  for compliance with the EHS policy by the distribution centres, the administrative Sites and stores in their country.\n\nThe Purchasing teams are responsible for collecting confirmation  of  acceptance  of  Applicable  Rules  from  the Suppliers via the Letter of Ethical Commitment.\n\nThey  use  audits  carried  out  by  third-party  companies  to ensure  that  Suppliers  included  in  the  Risk  Matrix  implement the prevention measures for EHS risks. As for Human Rights, the Purchasing teams discuss, during Management Committee  meetings  that  include  representatives  from  all Zones  and  purchasing  areas,  the  results  of  audits,  their consequences  for  commercial  relations,  and  the  related actions plans to achieve continuous improvement of results at the Group's Suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employees must be reminded of the Code of Ethics  and  its  contents  on  a  regular  basis.  Any  employee  in contact with Suppliers must receive the 'The Way We Work with  our  Suppliers'  guide  when  they  are  hired.  It  explains ethical standards that apply to Supplier relations.\n\nAn internal Ethics website is available to employees.\n\nAn annual Ethics Day, including Human Rights, has been held since  2009.  This  day  enables  employees  to  discuss  matters such as respect for Human Rights and fundamental freedoms via  a livestream  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  Chief  Executive  Officer  and the  other  members of the Executive Committee. Discussions on  ethics  are  also  organised  in  the  Subsidiaries  to  let employees  exchange  conversations  with  their  Subsidiary's General Manager.\n\nIn 2023, over 37,000 people logged on to Ethics Day sessions and more than 6,600 questions were asked worldwide.\n\nWith  respect  to  Suppliers,  in  addition  to  the  communication of  Applicable  Rules  via  the  letters  of  ethical  commitment, they are given access to the following documents (1) :\n\n- \u00b7 the Code of Ethics; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's  policy  on  Suppliers/subcontractors  and  child labour.\n\n## (ii)  Learning  about  Human  Rights  and  fundamental freedoms\n\nA new version of the specific, compulsory e-learning course on ethics  and  human  rights  was  launched  in  July  2023.  In  this version, the tool provides a reminder of the respect that the Group's top management has for Human Rights, and offers varied  and  interactive  content  and  exercises.  Notably,  it includes practical case studies to resolve, some of which can be customised according to the role selected by the user. The aim  is  for  all  employees  across  all  departments  to  complete this learning.\n\nNew  buyers  receive  compulsory  training  on  Responsible Purchasing  to  learn  about  how  to  ensure  respect  of  the Group's Ethical Principles.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  on  Supplier  audits,  detailing  the applicable audit procedure, is also available for all buyers. A version adapted for Suppliers is available on the website for strategic suppliers.\n\n## (iii) Communication about the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) in the workplace\n\nEHS managers are informed of the Applicable Rules by their functional hierarchy.\n\nGroup Sites are encouraged to hold a day dedicated to EHS to raise the awareness among all employees about the risks to which  they  are  exposed  and  suitable  prevention,  in  addition to specific local actions.\n\nA  Group  awareness-raising  campaign  about  major  safety risks, deployed over three years, and the implementation of a specific  topic  every  four  months,  serve  to  develop  employee awareness of risks over time.\n\nA monthly newsletter for the Group's EHS managers and their team leaders enables performance tracking and the sharing of best EHS practices.\n\n## (iv) Learning about the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) in the workplace\n\nLearning  sessions  dedicated  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS  policy  and practices  have  been  provided  at  all  levels  of  the  Company, as well as for temporary workers and subcontractors working on Group sites. They constitute one of the cornerstones in the implementation  of  risk identification and  management systems, and the deployment of the EHS culture in all Group entities.\n\nEHS learning includes the various learning actions for health and safety in  the  workplace,  or  the  environment  and  covers general EHS learning, EHS learning by \"m\u00e9tier\" (function) and specific EHS learning.\n\nGeneral EHS learning includes:\n\n- \u00b7 core general learning completed, for example, when a new employee arrives at a Site (L'Or\u00e9al administrative staff or temporary staff) regardless of their position; and\n- \u00b7 fire safety learning, first aid, pollution prevention, recycling, general EHS awareness raising etc.\n\nEHS  learning  by  m\u00e9tier  refers  to  learning  specific  to  a  given m\u00e9tier area or activity (for example, all of the filling and packing staff of a factory).\n\nSpecific EHS learning refers to EHS learning for a particular workstation and the activities carried out by the employee.\n\nIn terms of ergonomics, a 'Manual handling' e-learning course is provided to all employees.\n\nA  high  level  of  expertise  for  global  EHS  Teams  and  the development  of  an  EHS  culture  for  'Top  managers', managers  and  supervisors  is  assured  via  the  deployment  of learning specific to each person.\n\nTo  support  the  Environmental  aspect  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future programme, a learning programme on the challenges related  to  climate,  water,  biodiversity  and  resources  (Green steps for all) has been launched with the intention of training 100% of the Group's employees.",

Monitoring compliance with the Vigilance Plan\n\n## Risk hierarchy of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules\n\nThe risk hierarchy is used to enhance controls on compliance with the Applicable  Rules  by  defining  procedures  for monitoring compliance with the Rules that are consistent with the  risks, including  via  a  policy  of  third-party  audits, monitoring  and  evaluation  of  Suppliers  conducted  by  thirdparty  companies  such  as  EcoVadis.  The  Group's  vigilance  is strengthened  in  circumstances  where  conflict  is  involved, in line with applicable international standards.\n\nAs  far  as  Subsidiaries  are  concerned,  the  risk  hierarchy  of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules was created taking into  account  the  type  of  activity  and,  thereafter,  the  type of Site (1) .\n\n## SUBSIDIARY AUDIT MATRIX\n\n## Type of country\n\n## Sites audited\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\nWith respect to the Suppliers, the risk mapping  of non-compliance  with  the  Applicable  Rules  was  created  for Human  Rights,  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  environment, and health and safety in the workplace using a methodology that takes the following parameters into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The  country  in  which  the  Supplier's  sites  are  located: a  country  is  considered  vulnerable  in  terms  of  Human Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  and  environment, health and safety, if it meets at least one of the following criteria:\n- 1. The country is classified as 'High risk' or 'Extreme risk' according to the criteria of the consultancy firm Verisk Maplecroft:  12  evaluation  indices  are  used  in  this methodology  and  aggregated  in  a  single  grade compared  with  the  threshold  values  set  by  Verisk Maplecroft; and\n- 2. The results of social audits conducted by L'Or\u00e9al in the country  include  cases  of  Zero  Tolerance  or  Need Immediate Action ('NIA' rating that corresponds to the most severe non-conformities).\n- \u00b7 The  business  sector:  each  Supplier  is  associated  with  a sector area  according  to  a  governance  ranking  of Purchases ('Global Purchasing Categories').\n- \u00b7 The  nature  of  operations:  the  activities  most  heavily exposed to labour risk  are  the  activities  with  high  manual added value, implying work on a production line.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit and self-assessment system\n\n## (i) Audits\n\nAudits  of  Applicable  Rules :  Audits  of  Applicable  Rules  are used to check that the Plan is correctly implemented by the Subsidiaries and Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix. Audits are done by specialist external companies. When a Subsidiary or Supplier is audited, the process is carried out in accordance with  the  Risk  Matrix  set  out  above.  A  written  audit  report is  prepared. With respect to the Subsidiaries, the reports are stored  in  a  secure  database  available  to  Group  Human Relations Directors and to the Country Operations Directors, in  some  cases.  The  reports  on  Suppliers  are  intended  for Group buyers.\n\nEHS  audits  specific  to  Subsidiaries : In  order  to  ensure compliance  with  the  Group's  EHS  policy,  a  system  of worldwide  audits  has  been  in  place  since  1996,  and  was reinforced  in  2001  with  the  presence  of  external  auditors. These  are  experts  in  the  local  environment  and  regulations. These audits take place regularly on each L'Or\u00e9al site: every three  years  for  production  sites  and  every  four  years  for distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres. If the result of the audit does not meet the standard required by the L'Or\u00e9al guidelines, a specific interim audit is scheduled for  the  following  year.  Every  year,  the  teams  responsible  for EHS  risks  review  the  audit  results  and  identify  general improvement  plans.  The  improvement  plans  specific  to  the audited Sites are established immediately after the end of the audit.  Any  emergency  measure  intended  to  prevent  an imminent  risk  for  the  health  of  persons  at  the  Site  is implemented by the Site EHS teams without waiting for the completion  of  an  audit  even  if  it  is  not  part  of  the improvement  plan  that  may  exist.  There  are  various  audit grids  called  'risk',  'culture',  or  'combined  risk  and  culture', used  depending  on  the  maturity  and  type  of  activity  at  the Sites. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of practices and facilities with the Group's rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 progress in terms of EHS performance;\n- \u00b7 any  risks  that  the  sites  may  present  from  an  EHS standpoint; and\n- \u00b7 the  level  of  management  and  deployment  of  EHS  culture on the Sites.\n\nEach risk finding is classified in  one  of  three  categories  A,  B and C according to a matrix of level of impact/probability of occurrence. 'A' findings are monitored monthly and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\nThe monthly reporting of safety and environmental data also enables  consolidation  and  analysis  of  any  anomalies  and incidents  leading  to  regulatory  non-conformity,  complaints and/or fines.\n\n## Three types of audit specific to Suppliers :\n\n- \u00b7 initial audits: first audits conducted, which are a prerequisite  to  the  start  of  the  relationship  with  a  new Supplier;\n- \u00b7 follow-up  audits:  audits  done  12  to  24  months  maximum after the immediate improvement request (Needs Immediate Action or NIA), depending on the severity of the non-conformities found; and\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\n## The possible outcomes of the audits are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Satisfactory: all  criteria  conform  to  the  Applicable  Rules and the best practices are highlighted;\n- \u00b7 Needs Continuous Improvement (NCI): minor non-conformities  were  found,  but  they  do  not  have  an impact on employee safety or health;\n- \u00b7 Needs  Immediate  Action (NIA): non-conformities  are reported  either  because  they  are  serious,  because  they are recurring or have a potential impact on the health and safety of employees;\n- \u00b7 Zero Tolerance (ZT): reported, for example, in the event of a  critical  non-conformity  because  of  child  labour,  forced labour, physical abuse, restricted freedom of movement, an immediate  risk  of  accident  for  employees  or  attempted bribery of the auditors (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 Access  Denied: reported  when  the  audit  is  refused (for example in the event of refusal to provide partial or full site access to the auditors).\n\nIn the event  of  a  non-conformity  (Needs  Continuous Improvement,  Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance), corrective action plans must be implemented which are then audited  at  the  level  of  the  Subsidiary  or  Supplier.  Failure to  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  can,  in  the  case  of a  Subsidiary,  result  in  an  alert  being  sent  to  the  Country Manager.  Subsidiaries  can  decide  to  link  part  or  all  of  the remuneration of their managers and/or of their performance evaluation to the implementation of the Applicable Rules.\n\nIn  the  case  of  Suppliers,  serious  non-conformities  (Needs Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance  and  Access  Denied) or the failure to implement corrective action can result in the non-listing of a new Supplier or the suspension or termination of commercial relations with a listed Supplier.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  existence  of  a  serious  non-conformity with the Applicable Rules is reported, a specific audit can be initiated.  Visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the  process  of routine visits made to Suppliers. They can result, if necessary, in additional audits.\n\n## Specific EHS audits of subcontractors' sites\n\nAdditional specific EHS audits are conducted by independent third parties for subcontractor sites for aerosol production or storage,  bleaching  powders,  flammable  products  under  the criteria  defined  by  L'Or\u00e9al,  which  are  similar  to  those  used for  the  Group's  sites.  These  audits  are  triggered  at  the  time of  referencing/qualification  and  are  followed  up  via  audits conducted between 12 months and 36 months maximum after the immediate improvement request (NIA), depending on the severity of the non-conformities found, and again at the time of confirmation, five years after the initial audit.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  are  the  same  type  as  those previously described: satisfactory, NCI, NIA and ZT.\n\nSerious  non-conformities  (Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero Tolerance  and  Access  Denied)  or  the  failure  to  implement corrective  actions  can  result  in  the  non-listing  of  a  new Supplier  or  the  suspension  or  termination  of  commercial relations with a listed Supplier.\n\nAll  the  main  non-conformities  found  are  monitored  and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\n- \u00b7 confirmation audits, three years after the initial audit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the  process  of routine visits made to Suppliers. They can result, if necessary, in additional audits.\n\nAdditional procedures : L'Or\u00e9al also uses analyses and ratings provided by EcoVadis, an analytical company, to evaluate the policies implemented by the Suppliers, among others, in terms of  the  issues  covered  by  the  Plan.  This  evaluation  is  an indicative  guide  that  can  be  added  to  the  audits  described above.  By  participating  in  the  EcoVadis  assessment,  L'Or\u00e9al compares  its  environmental  and  social  policy  with  the expertise  and  the  recommendations  of  external  auditors qualified  in  the  analysis  of  multi-sector  risks.  This  is  a  useful rating for the continuous improvement of L'Or\u00e9al's programme,  it  also  contributes  to  the  transparency  of industry practices. This assessment is used to select suppliers by  taking  their  environmental  and  social  performance  into consideration.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  co-founder  of  the  Responsible Beauty Initiative (RBI), a sector initiative created in 2017 with EcoVadis.  It  brings  together  eight  major  players  in  the cosmetics industry for the sustainable transformation of the entire beauty supply chain.\n\n## (ii) Self-assessment system\n\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms : An annual ethics reporting  system  enables  monitoring  of  the  implementation of the Applicable Rules in the Subsidiaries, namely with regard to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nEnvironment,  health  and  safety  in  the  workplace : The Management  Committees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Sites  have  tools  for the  self-assessment  of  their  practices  based  on  the  audit standards  provided  to  them.  This  enables  them  to  produce an improvement plan, if required. These self-assessments are input data in the EHS risk audits.\n\nTo direct its performance:\n\n- \u00b7 every  year,  each  Subsidiary  site  defines  and  revises  its safety and environmental roadmaps to achieve the targets set by the Group. It tracks EHS indicators monthly;\n- \u00b7 at  Group  level,  the  indicators  are  consolidated  monthly by region and globally for the Group's results; and\n- \u00b7 a  Greenhouse  Gas  Assessment  is  prepared  annually (in accordance with the GHG Protocol).\n\n## 3.4.6. Whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system\n\n'L'Or\u00e9al Speak Up', L'Or\u00e9al's internal whistleblowing mechanism, has been in place since 2008. This system gives employees and stakeholders access to a secure website that they can use to raise any concerns they may have, including serious  infringements  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms,  the  health  and  safety  of  people  at  work,  and respect  for  the  environment,  with  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance  Officer  in  a  secure,  effective  manner  that\n\nprovides  all  the  guarantees  of  confidentiality  necessary  for the reporting of potential breaches. Any allegations expressed in good faith are examined in detail and adequate corrective measures  are  taken,  if  applicable.  Employees  have  several other  methods  of  raising  their  concerns  (line  management, dedicated  local  hotlines  etc.).  The  whistle-blowing  line  was opened  to  employees  in  2008,  and  then  to  stakeholders in 2018.\n\n## 3.4.7. Update on the effective implementation of the Plan\n\nThis paragraph provides the 2023 results of the application of the Plan for Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## 3.4.7.1. General results of whistleblowing mechanisms and reporting\n\nIn 2023, there were 678 reports on potential non-compliance with the Applicable Rules, including:\n\n- \u00b7 34 on sexual harassment, 19 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  and  which  resulted  in  7  departures  from  the Group;\n- \u00b7 111 on bullying, 37 of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in eight departures from the Group;\n- \u00b7 30 on discrimination, six of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which did not result in any departures from the Group;\n- \u00b7 24 on health and safety, six of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in three departures from the Group; and\n- \u00b7 2  on  the  environment,  neither  of  which  were  proven,  in whole or in part.\n\n## 3.4.7.2. Results of the application of the Plan to Subsidiaries\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  incorporated  into  the  Group's Subsidiaries' internal rules. Employees learn through an online learning programme on ethics. At the end of 2022, 87% of the relevant employees had completed this learning programme. A  new  version  was  launched  in  July  2023  as  part  of  the publication of the new Code of Ethics. As at 31 December 2023, 66% of the relevant employees had already completed it.\n\nEach  EHS  manager  and  each  person  working  in  a  factory or  distribution  centre  is  trained  in  the  Applicable  Rules  on Health, Safety and the Environment (EHS). All new employees are trained in the Rules on Health and Safety in the workplace and the Environment, regardless of their work location.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring and control system in respect of Human Rights\n\nA  total  of  13  audits  have  been  carried  out  at  the  Group's factories and distribution centres, covering all Human Rights Rules  with  the  exception  of  those  relating  to  health  and safety,  which  are  subject  to  specific  audits  and  organised separately.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to L'Or\u00e9al employees, an audit revealed that the  weekly  working  hours  of  two  employees  on  the  same site  were  not  in  line  with  the  Group's  policy.  The  policy defines  a  remediation  plan  that  includes  changing  the working hours.\n- \u00b7 The other non-conformities flagged during these 13 audits concerned  employees  of  external  companies  (temporary workers or subcontractors) working at Group-owned sites. These non-conformities can be broken down as follows:\n- (i) Child  labour :  it  is  reported  that,  in  2023,  19  employees were aged 16 to 18 (1) ; there were no employees under the age of 16 working at the Subsidiaries;\n- (ii) Forced labour : an audit found that three employees of a temporary  work  company  did  not  have  copies  of  their employment contracts; to remediate this, the site quickly ensured  that  these  individual  non-conformities  were resolved  by  the  company  concerned  and  defined  a procedure to systematically verify that external workers have copies of their employment contracts;\n- (iii) Freedom  of  association :  the  audits  revealed  no  nonconformity;\n- (iv) Non-discrimination : the audits revealed no nonconformity;\n- (v) Working hours : an audit revealed that the hours worked by three employees of a temporary work company had not been recorded; to remediate this, the site expanded its system for recording hours worked by using electronic tags already used for L'Or\u00e9al site employees to include external workers;\n- (vi) Wages and charges :  an  audit  was  unable  to  verify  the compliance of salaries paid to employees as owed in the absence  of  a  record  of  the  hours  worked  by  the  three employees  of  a  temporary  work  company  cited  in  (v); moving  forwards,  conformity  verifications  will  be  made possible  by  the  aforementioned  expansion  of  the  tag system  to  include  external  workers.  This  audit  also flagged that five employees from external companies did not have  national  social insurance because  their respective  employers  had  not  organised  the  required medical  visits  prior  to  hiring  them;  upon  receipt  of  the audit  report,  the  site  required  the  external  companies concerned to resolve individual non-compliant situations within three months and to allow the site to systematically check compliance with their requirements in this matter;\n- (vii) Sexual harassment and bullying :  the  audits revealed no non-conformity;\n- (viii) Disciplinary  practices : the  audits  revealed  no  nonconformity; and\n- (ix) Subcontracting : the audits revealed no non-conformity.\n\n## Monitoring and control system in respect of Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nIn  2023,  119  'Top  managers'  (managers  of  factories  or distribution  centres,  Management  Committee  members  etc.) attended  the  Leadership  &  Safety  Culture  seminar,  held  at the CEDEP, The European Centre for Executive Development, at the INSEAD campus in France. The seminar aims to raise awareness  with  top  managers  about  safety  issues,  increase their leadership ability and see these behaviours adopted and maintained over the long term.\n\n35 factories are certified ISO 45001, representing 95% of the Group's factories.\n\nIn 2023, the following EHS audits were conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 22 risk audits;\n- \u00b7 8 combined EHS culture and risk audits;\n- \u00b7 8  combined  Quality,  Environment,  Health,  Safety  and Performance audits and 1 combined Quality, Environment, Health and Safety audit; and\n- \u00b7 49  additional  EHS  audits  of  subcontracting  sites  in factories, and 18 in external distribution centres.\n\nThe most frequently identified risks during EHS risk audits are related  to  fire  protection,  procedure  safety,  hazardous energy,  containment  of  fire  water  runoff  and  wastewater management. The cases of non-conformity and formal notice were systematically subject to corrective actions.\n\nIn  2023,  regulatory  non-conformities  were  found  at  nine factories with regard to the quality of their wastewater. Two factories  were  fined  a  total  of  $1,500  for  these  nonconformities. In addition, two factories received neighbourhood complaints that did not result in a fine.\n\n## 3.4.7.3. Results of the application of the Plan to Suppliers\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\n100% of strategic Suppliers in the direct purchases category and  94.4%  of  strategic  Suppliers  in  the  indirect  purchases category  have  made  a  contractual  commitment  to  comply with the Applicable Rules.\n\nAll  purchasers  know  the  Applicable  Rules  and  know  which people to contact in the event of doubts.\n\nIn 2023,  143  newly  recruited  purchasers  in  the  Group completed  an  in-depth  learning  programme  on  responsible purchases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  audits  cover  questions  on  Human  Rights  as  well  as Environment,  Health  and  Safety  and  cover  all  activities  of the audited site without being limited to the parts of the site that operate for L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n1,242  on-site  audits  were  conducted  in  2023 \u2611 ,  as  part  of regular audits, but also ad hoc audits following a risk analysis (16 ad hoc audits in 2023) (1) .\n\nThe cases of non-conformity noted during these social audits that come under the Plan are described below.\n\nIn  2023,  965  suppliers  conducted  an  Ecovadis  assessment  of their  social,  environmental  and  ethical  policies,  as  well  as  the implementation of those policies by their own suppliers in 2023.\n\n## In terms of Human Rights\n\n## Results of audits by topic\n\n- (i) Child labour: 1% non-conformity \u2611 .  The non-conformities noted concerned in particular the absence of procedures to verify age at the time of hiring by the Supplier, as well as failure to adhere to the conditions prescribed by the law  regarding  the  employment  of  young  people  and apprentices.  The  concerned  Suppliers  were  asked  to correct  these  situations,  and  follow-up  audits  were planned.\n- (ii) Forced  labour: 5.6%  non-conformity \u2611 .  Cases  of  nonconformity  concerned  the  demand  for  a  monetary deposit  at  the  time  of  hiring,  withholding  of  identity documents without a legal requirement, the freedom for administrative staff to end their contracts without being penalised  (financially  or  otherwise),  the  absence  or inadequacy  of  employment  contracts,  and  the  absence or inadequacy of work permits for foreign workers. The main corrective measures requested were the return of the  identity  documents  and  the  updating  of  worker contracts.  Follow-up  audits  will  check  the  effective implementation of these corrective measures.\n- (iii) Freedom of association and right to collective bargaining (2) : 2.4% non-conformity \u2611 .  Most of the cases of  non-conformity  concern  the  failure  to  freely  elect worker representatives without management interference.  Elections  must  be  carried  out,  or  in countries  where  such  elections  are  not  legal,  worker meetings must be organised or alternative arrangements made  for  workers  to  raise  any  concerns  or  complaints they may have.\n- (iv) Non-discrimination: 0.9% non-conformity \u2611 . These cases of non-conformity mainly concern the absence of a clear and uniform policy to ensure the absence of discrimination  in  recruitment  or  discrimination  in  the payment  of  wages  and  other  costs.  It  was  also  noted that  some  suppliers  required  pregnancy  tests  as  part  of the recruitment process. In addition, there was one proven case  of  discrimination.  Suppliers  were  requested  to  take corrective action, which will be checked in future audits.\n- (v) Working  hours: 25%  non-conformity \u2611 .  Cases  of  nonconformity  involved  failure  to  comply  with  applicable legislation regarding working hours and mandatory rest periods,  but  also  the  lack  of  sufficient  documents  to ensure  correct  application  of  legislation.  In  all  of  these cases,  corrective  action  plans  are  implemented  and  a follow-up audit is planned.\n- (vi) Wages and charges: 18.1% non-conformity \u2611 . The audits did  not  find  any  salary  withholdings  or  undue  charges. Most of the cases of non-conformity concerned insurance and social  security  contributions,  as  well  as  a  failure  to monitor the payment of wages, or non-payment of the minimum  wage.  When  an  audit  notes  a  case  of non-compliance with regard to the correct settlement of wages,  social  benefits  or  the  correct  payment  of overtime,  even  though  these  are  not  undue  salary deductions,  the  Suppliers  are  requested  to  correct  the situation and a follow-up audit is planned.\n- (vii) Sexual harassment and bullying: 2.5% non-conformity \u2611 . Most  of  these  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  the absence of a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment  and  bullying  or  the  absence  of  an  internal system  allowing  the  situation  to  be  reported  without negative  consequences  for  the  concerned  worker. Suppliers  were  requested  to  draft  these  policies,  which will be checked in future audits. The other cases of nonconformity  did  not  concern  serious  breaches  of  the Applicable Rules.\n- (viii) Disciplinary  practices: 1.8%  non-conformity \u2611 .  Most  of these cases of non-conformity concerned the illegality or absence  of  clear  written  rules  regarding  disciplinary practices,  or  a  lack  of  communication  of  these  rules  to the  workers.  Suppliers  were  requested  to  draft  these rules, which will be checked in future audits.\n- (ix) Subcontracting: 1.3%  non-conformity \u2611 .  Most  cases  of non-conformity  related  Suppliers  not  ensuring  that L'Or\u00e9al's  standards  of  ethics  are  upheld  in  their  own supply chain. Corrective action has been requested and will be checked in future audits.\n\n## Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n41.4% \u2611 of  the  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  the applicable rules on Health, Safety and the Environment. Most of these cases involved the absence of fire safety certificates, a lack of learning about emergency evacuations, handling of fire  extinguishers  or  the  use  of  protective  equipment,  the absence  of  an  evacuation  plan,  or  breaches  with  regard  to emergency  routes  or  exits.  In  all  of  these  cases,  corrective action  plans  are  implemented  and  a  follow-up  audit  is planned.",

Risk factors and risk management\n\n## 3.5.1. Definitions and general framework\n\nRisk  management  (events  or  situations,  the  occurrence  of which  is  uncertain,  could  have  a  financial,  non-financial, or  reputational  impact)  is  a  process  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  (the  'Group'). Risk  management  consists  of  identifying,  assessing  and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  its  development  and the  achievement  of  its  objectives,  the  Group  strives  to anticipate and manage the risks to which it is exposed in its\n\n## 3.5.2. Risk mapping\n\nThe Group's risk  mapping  process  is  led  by  the  Ethics,  Risks and Compliance Department with the support of all Support Divisions  and  functions.  This  mapping  is  reviewed  by  the Group's Executive Committee, which validates it.\n\n## 3.5.3. Risk factors\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  changing  environment.  Like  any company, it is necessarily exposed to risks which, if they were to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  its  business activities,  its  financial  position  and  its  assets,  particularly  in terms of reputation and image.\n\nFor taking an informed investment decision, as required by the regulations  in  force,  this  paragraph  presents  the  major  risks in a limited number of categories (given the probability of their occurrence  and  the  expected  magnitude  of  their  negative impact) taking risk management policies into account. In each\n\ndifferent areas of activity. In addition, the Internal Rules of the Board  of  Directors  specify  the  role  of  the  Audit  Committee which 'must ensure that General Management has the means to  enable  it  to  identify  and  manage  the  economic,  financial, legal and sustainability risks the Group faces both within and outside  France  in  the  conduct  of  its  normal  or  exceptional operations.'.\n\nOn the basis of the work by the Internal Audit Department, the analysis of major risks, in conjunction with the processes used  by  subsidiaries,  makes  it  possible  to  identify  Internal Control improvements and update the Group's standards.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  for  all  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities  is  updated annually.  This  process  to  identify,  analyse  and  assess significant risks strengthens Group actions and allows them to be  prioritised.  The  results  of  this  work  are  presented  to  the Audit  Committee.  The  main  risks  to  which  the  Group  is exposed are described below.\n\ncategory,  the  most  material  risks  are  mentioned  first. This  paragraph  specifies  the  way  in  which  each  risk  factor could  affect  L'Or\u00e9al  as  well  as  the  management  policy implemented.\n\nRisk  management  work  classifies  the  residual  risks  by category of importance (low, moderate or significant).\n\nHowever, a wholly risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the Group could be adversely impacted by other risks of which it is not currently aware or which it does not consider material at the date of this document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business risks\n\n## Business risks/Information Systems and cybersecurity\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn a context  of  digital transformation  and  constant development of information technologies and their uses, the Group's business activities, expertise and, more generally, its relations  with  all  stakeholders  in  its  social  and  economic environment,  depend  on  an  increasingly  virtual  and  digital operation.\n\nAs a result, the malfunction or shutdown of these systems, the  leakage  or  destruction  of  data  for  exogenous  or endogenous reasons (including cyberattacks, malicious acts, hacks etc.) internally or at a third-party of the Group could have a material impact on the Group's business activities.\n\nThe  IT  Department  has  implemented  strict  security  rules  for infrastructures, devices and applications. Furthermore, to adapt to the development of new ways of communication and collaboration, L'Or\u00e9al has introduced an Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice. To  deal  with  the  growing  cyber-threats,  L'Or\u00e9al continuously  strengthens  the  resources  dedicated  to  information system  security.  A  multi-year  plan  aimed  at  reducing  the  level  of  risk from cyberthreats and strengthening the maturity of risk management was therefore set out.\n\nThis  plan  relies  in  particular  on  anti-intrusion  solutions,  regular  read teaming  and  penetration  tests,  an  information  system  security  audit programme, the protection of sensitive assets and global supervision to detect  malicious  activities.  L'Or\u00e9al's  security  focus  is  constantly adjusted  to  deal  with  new  threats  of  cyberattacks.  For  example,  the Group  is  increasingly  investing  in  incidents  detection  and  reactions systems and proceeds to regular reviews of the effectiveness of these solutions.\n\nAn  online  learning  programme  for  cybersecurity  best  practices  is available for all eligible employees (48,487 employees have completed the ' Join the next Shield!' programme, which equates to 81% of eligible employees). Specific learning programmes are also available for other employees. In addition to regular communication throughout the year, the Group conducts an annual worldwide awareness-raising campaign called Cyberweek.\n\nManagement  of  risks  related  to  data  is  described  in  the  'Data'  risk section.",

More  specifically,  the  global  development  of  the cosmetics  market  has  led  L'Or\u00e9al  to  develop  its  Travel  Retail business  and  its  business  in  countries  of  North  Asia,  which represented 25.9% of sales in 2023, SAPMENA-SSA (South Asia Pacific,  Middle  East,  North  Africa,  Sub-Saharan  Africa),  8.4%  of sales, and  Latin  America,  7.1%  of  sales.  Because  of  this globalisation,  political  or  economic  disruption  (strong  economic slowdown  e.g.  due  to  growing  geopolitical  tensions  such  as  the Ukraine/Russia  situation,  sustained  high  inflation,  international trade tensions or sovereign debt crises) in countries in which the Group generates a significant  portion  of  its  sales  could  have  an impact on its business activity.\n\nThe impact and management of inflation risks, currency risks, and those associated with economic sanctions policies, are described in the risk factors entitled 'Inflation and currency risk' and 'Risk of non-conformity' respectively.\n\n## Business risks/Sanitary crisis\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nBecause  of  its  worldwide  presence,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  exposed  to epidemics  or  other  public  sanitary  crises  in  the  79  countries  in which it operates.\n\nThe main risks identified cover different segments of the Group's business activities:\n\n- \u00b7 impairment of the health, safety and security of employees in the  context  of  their  duties  and  their  business  travel,  and confinement  of  the  population  that  prevents  employees  from entering their work site, particularly at the manufacturing and distribution sites;\n- \u00b7 difficulties for the company to operate normally because of the restrictive  measures  established  by  the  authorities,  which restrict employee access to the Group's sites, or as a result of the  unavailability  of  individual  protective  equipment  necessary to protect them;\n- \u00b7 supply  difficulties,  unavailability  or  increased  prices  of  raw materials  and  components,  and  limited  capacities  to  produce and  distribute  products  related  to  the  restrictive  health measures  established  by  the  authorities  of  the  countries  in which the Group operates;\n- \u00b7 reductions  in  product  demand  related  to  the  impact  of  the measures to restrict movement on access to physical points of sale, particularly in the Travel Retail network that is particularly sensitive to sanitary crises; and\n- \u00b7 financial  difficulties  for  suppliers  and  clients  as  a  result  of  a drastic reduction in their levels of business.\n\nDepending on its duration, geographic expansion and the resulting economic and social consequences, a sanitary crisis  may  have  a material impact on the Group's activities, its performance and its reputation.\n\nThe crisis management system is led by a unit at Group level that can prevent and limit the impacts of undesirable events on all its entities.\n\nFacing  a  sanitary  crisis,  the  Group's  priority  is  to  protect  the health, safety and security of its employees. The Group responds through  compliance  with  the  directives  of  the  authorities  in  the countries in which it operates, the application and adaptation of its worldwide, high management standards for health and safety at its operational sites and in business travel situations.\n\nThe  Group's  information  systems  allow  large-scale  development of  flexible  and  remote  work  methods  and  are  the  subject  of adequate safety protection processes (see paragraph 4.3.2.4.).\n\nThe  policies  to  manage  supply  chain  and  inventories,  and  the business  continuity  plans  of  the  administrative,  industrial  and logistics sites, allow the Group to anticipate the actions necessary to manage disturbances. The long-term relations with the Group's strategic suppliers, the policies to diversify sources, and operational continuity plans, limit the impacts of these crises.\n\nThe  Group's  presence  in  all  distribution  channels,  particularly online sales capacities developed with diversified partners (owned sites, e-retailers, pure players), as well as its expertise in digitised consumer relations, help to maximise development opportunities in disturbed contexts.\n\nThe  Group's  worldwide  and  balanced  presence  in  terms  of geographic  areas,  product  categories  and  distribution  channels, the  very  high  responsiveness  and  capacity  for  adaptation  of  its teams  through  its  strategically  centralised  and  operationally decentralised organisational model with a strong entrepreneurial spirit, as well as its robust financial position, contribute to its ability to face the economic consequences of these crises.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's global presence and  its portfolio of 37 major international  brands  helps  to  maintain  a  balance  in  sales  and offsetting between the geographic zones, product categories and distribution  channels  (details  on  sales  from  the  zones  are presented in section 1.3).\n\nWith  regard  to  Ukraine-Russia,  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  closely monitor  the  situation  and  its  potential  for  adversely  impacting the worldwide economy and, in particular, its business activity.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  particular,  the  European General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  of  27  April 2016, which entered into force on 25 May 2018, (GDPR) provides for major sanctions in Europe, as does the CCPA in California, the LGPD in Brazil or the PIPL in China and the POPI Act in South Africa. The increasing adoption of various laws aimed at limiting and controlling the transfer of data is also a growing risk factor to which L'Or\u00e9al is exposed.\n\nAny  breach  of  data  integrity  or  confidentiality,  particularly personal data processed by L'Or\u00e9al or its partners, for exogenous or  endogenous  reasons  (including  intrusions,  malicious  acts  etc.) could impact the privacy or safety of its users, have a significant impact on its reputation and consumer confidence and thus on the Group's business activities and financial position.\n\nThe Group constantly and progressively deploys policies, learning and  data  management  tools  as  well  as  the  associated organisational and technical measures. The Global IT Department has  introduced  strict  rules  about  data  security  (back-up, protection of, and restrictions on access to confidential data).\n\nThe Group's principles governing the processing of personal data have been rolled-out all over the world to raise the awareness of all  employees  about  respect  for  ethical  principles,  and  legal  and regulatory requirements in the matter.\n\nAn organisation has been set up based on a Global Data Privacy Office  at  Group  level,  comprising  a  legal  unit  and  a  programme unit. A Group Data Protection Officer was appointed in 2018 and a network of 47 Country DPOs has been created, for all countries in the European Zone and gradually in other regions of the world.\n\nThe  governance  is  based  on  a  Global  Strategic  Committee, a Steering Committee by region, as well as a network of Heads of Data  Privacy  within  the  M\u00e9tiers  (Transversal  Functions)  and Zones,  responsible  for  the  protection  of  personal  data.  They provide support to all operational stakeholders involved.\n\nThis governance notably aims to monitor the Group's compliance with different laws, by ensuring the mobilisation of all stakeholders and by adapting customer, supplier and business line processes to the Group's rules and to applicable laws.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  in  terms  of  personal  data  and  the  risk management systems are detailed in paragraph 4.3.3.2.\n\n- L'Or\u00e9al has implemented the following:\n- \u00b7 crisis communication learning, creation of a crisis management system  dedicated  to  reputation  protection  and  creating  a network of experts, and support for the communication teams on key topics for the Group;\n- \u00b7 crisis risk management at corporate and local levels;\n- \u00b7 permanent  monitoring  (across  14  languages)  of  the  Group's media including social media accounts. The subsidiaries deploy their own social media and web monitoring systems under the responsibility of their Director of Communication and immediately  report  a  media  risk  in  their  country  to  the Corporate Communications Department; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  crisis  management  procedure  which  is tasked with preventing, managing and mitigating the consequences of undesirable events on the company worldwide. The  Group  crisis  management  officer  reports  directly  to General Management.\n\nThe deployment of the Code of Ethics throughout the Group aims at reinforcing the dissemination of the rules of conduct which form the basis of L'Or\u00e9al's integrity and ethics. These rules of conduct seek  to  guide  actions  and  behaviour,  inspire  choices  and  make sure that the Group's values are reflected in the everyday acts of each  employee.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a  'Code  of  Good Practice for the Use of Social Media' for its employees.",

In  addition,  civil society is expressing higher expectations with regard companies' integrity  and  transparency  and  the  way  in  which  they  manage scientific and technological innovations. These expectations may, for example, relate to the responsible use of artificial intelligence. Such  non-compliance  with  its  commitments  or  the  lack  of  a response to new ethical questions could have an adverse impact on  the  Group's  reputation  and  expose  it  to  criminal  or administrative sanctions.\n\nThe  Group's  policies  on  sustainability, social and  societal responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based  on  the Ethical Principles. The role and the resources granted to the Chief Ethics Officer allow him to succeed in his mission by relying on all the  teams  and  resources  of  the  Group  (see  subsection  3.2.1.). Specific  learning  for  management  teams,  regular  dialogue  with stakeholders  and  the  establishment  of  internal  working  groups, facilitate  the  inclusion  of  Ethics  in  the  Group's  new  policies  and strategic  decisions.  The  ethical  risks  are  mapped  and  regularly updated, including for suppliers and subcontractors (see paragraph  3.4.5.2.).  The  deployment  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  and specific complementary policies throughout the Group, mandatory specific e-learning and ongoing communication campaigns via an Ethics  Day  ensure  that  employees  are  aware  of  the  ethical standards.  A  network  of  81  Ethics  Correspondents  around  the world and regular contact between the Chief Ethics Officer and the Countries, ensure close relationships with these employees.\n\nCompliance  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  is  taken  into  account  each year when evaluating the overall performance of employees.\n\nRegular audits of the Group's sites and those of its suppliers and subcontractors  (see  section  3.4),  the  Group's  whistleblowing  line (www.lorealspeakup.com) opened in 2018 accessible to all Group stakeholders,  as  well  as  a  procedure  to  collect  and  process reports, allow to manage potential violations.\n\nIn 2023, L'Or\u00e9al established its Reliable Artificial Intelligence policy. This was incorporated into the Code of Ethics, updated in 2023.\n\nThe  Group  continually  adapts  its  innovation  model  and  is constantly  increasing  its  investments  in  research  and  digital services.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Research  &  Innovation  team  innovates  to respond to the infinite diversity of beauty aspirations all over the world.  The  Consumer  &  Market  Insights  Department,  within  the Innovation  Department,  is  constantly  monitoring  changes  in consumer expectations by product category and major regions of the world.\n\nThese research programmes all form part of a long-term vision. They  allow  L'Or\u00e9al  to  rise  to  the  challenges  of  innovation  (see subsection 1.3.7.).\n\nThe  Digital  and  Marketing  Department  is  responsible  for accelerating  the  Group's  digital  transformation  by  helping  the brands create enriched spaces for expression and helping teams to establish more interactive, close-knit and bespoke relationships with consumers.\n\nConsumer expectations  with  regard  to  sustainability  are  also  at the  heart  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (see chapter  4).  These  are  taken  into  account  in  developing  the Group's brand and product portfolio.\n\nThe  Group's  acquisition  strategy  always  takes  into  account changes in the competitive environment.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is  changing  within  a  complex,  highly  competitive  and  rapidly changing environment (globalisation, diversity, equity and inclusion challenges, sustainability issues, acceleration  of  the  digital transformation etc.) that requires specific expertise. The Covid-19 health crisis has left a significant mark on the job market, with new employee  expectations,  particularly  with  the  introduction  of  a sustainable  hybrid  work  mode,  alternating  between  on-site  and remote working. If L'Or\u00e9al fails to identify, attract, recruit, retain, promote  and  develop  competent  and  engaged  employees  who behave responsibly  within  diverse  teams,  the  development  of  its activities and its results could be affected.\n\nMoreover,  given  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities,  particularly  its  industrial operations,  the  risk  of  occupational  injuries  or  illnesses  could become a reality.\n\nPsychosocial risks may affect the well-being of Group employees. This could also have an adverse impact on their commitment and, consequently, on the Group's performance.\n\nThe  Group  is  developing  a  motivating,  professional  environment with respect for its ethical values, particularly diversity, equity and inclusion. The recruitment and development of employees occurs within a long-term perspective, also to ensure the continuity of key functions  within  the  Group,  in  which  learning  plays  a  core  role throughout an employee's career.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  combines  external  competitiveness  and internal  fairness.  It  recognises  both  individual  and  collective performance.\n\nThe  worldwide Share  &  Care programme  meets  the  essential needs  of  each  of  the  Group's  employees  in  terms  of  benefits, healthcare,  parenthood,  flexibility  and  quality  of  life  at  work. Actions for stress prevention, psychological support and workstation  ergonomics  have  been  arranged.  In  order  to  meet employees' expectations in this new hybrid working environment, L'Or\u00e9al  has  developed  a  balanced  Group  policy  to  ensure  that opportunities for cooperation, discussion and creativity are always prioritised.\n\nSince 2010 and as part of the 2030 Health and Safety Strategy, the  Group  has  set  itself  ambitious  objectives  and  defined  global procedures and standards based on two pillars: risk management and  the  development  of  an  interdependent  Health  and  Safety culture (see paragraph 4.3.2.1.).\n\nAfter  an  initial  component  of  its  Simplicity  programme  centred around the transformation of managerial behaviour was launched in  2018,  the  Group  implemented  a  second  component,  Simplicity 2, in 2023, which focuses more on work habits and processes with a  view  to  providing  concrete  solutions  regarding  workload, reducing tasks with low added value and improving employee wellbeing at work. The Pulse survey, an annual employee satisfaction survey, makes it possible to identify potential well-being risks and implement appropriate action plans.\n\nThe  presence  of  the  Group's  brands  in  all  types  of  distribution channels  allows  the  Group  to  offer  its  products  and  services, whatever  the  consumer  practices.  The  departments  concerned anticipate  trends  to  adapt  to  these  changes  and,  in  particular, have steadily developed online sales with diversified partners (edistributors, platforms, and market places).\n\nThe  Group  has  set  a  solid  internal  control  system,  including  the deployment of certain guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 a  Code  of  Good  Practice  for  the  Use  of  Social  Media  for  its employees;\n- \u00b7 an  Influencer  Values  Charter  and  a Social  Selling  Values Charter that each influencer or social seller with whom L'Or\u00e9al collaborates undertakes to respect; and\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  principles  and  the  operational  processes  to  be applied  in  relation  to  partnerships  with  influencers  and  social sellers have been circulated worldwide to all employees involved in advocacy  marketing.  The  Group  seeks  to  work  with influencers  & social  sellers  who  share  its  values  and  Ethical Principles.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  relationship,  the Group  reserves  the  right  to  pursue  due  diligence  by  way  of reviewing  information  already  in  the  public  domain.  These documents effectively complement the rules of conduct set out in the Group's Code of Ethics.",

The  principles  governing  the  Group's  quality  and safety policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 satisfaction of customer needs;\n- \u00b7 compliance with safety requirements and laws;\n- \u00b7 maintenance  of  standards  and  regular  updates  of  safety assessment approaches; and\n- \u00b7 product quality and conformity across the supply chain.\n\nThe Environmental Safety Department specifically evaluates the safety  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the toxicological  profile  of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  tolerance  of the formulas before they are launched on the market, so that the Group's  products  can  be  guaranteed  to  be  completely  safe  for consumer use. The same safety standards are applied worldwide to ensure identical quality across the globe.\n\nIn  anticipation  of  updates  to  regulations,  the  environmental profiles  of  the  raw  materials  (that  exist  or  are  included  in  the catalogue) in finished products are also evaluated with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of the ingredients used by the Group.\n\nThrough its international cosmeto-vigilance network, L'Or\u00e9al goes one step further in safety assessments by monitoring the potential adverse effects that may arise once the product is on the market, in order to take the appropriate corrective measures, if necessary (see 'Product quality and safety: a priority' in subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2.).\n\nIn terms of questions that civil society may ask regarding certain substances  and  their  effects  on  health  and  the  environment, L'Or\u00e9al's position can be summarised in three points:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilant monitoring of any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u00b7 cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u00b7 precaution  leading  to  the  substitution  of  ingredients  in  the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  relies  on  its  scientific  teams  to  answer  consumers' questions  about  the  safety  of  its  products,  primarily  through  its Inside our Products platform that has been online since 2019.\n\nQuality standards are defined by our Conception Quality Systems for  Formulas,  Packagings,  Manufacturing  Processes  and  by  our Conformity Quality Systems for Production and Supply Chain. All factories are ISO 9001 certified for their production and follow the Best Manufacturing Practices in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard.  In  the  case  of  production  subcontracting,  the  rules governing  the  choice  of  the  subcontractor  and  its  production follow  the  same  principles.  The  subcontracting  quality  charter picks  up  these  requirements,  compliance  with  which  is  assessed during  audits  and  the  plan  regularly  strengthened  to  ensure appropriate control of our partners.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n<!-- image -->",

significant  non-compliance  with  ethical commitments, along with a major interruption of operations in a L'Or\u00e9al  industrial  unit  or  shipping  hub,  could  impact  the  Group's sales  because  of  the  unavailability  of  products  that  could  result from this. In  2023,  Group  purchases  related  to  production  totalled \u20ac6.4 billion or more than 15% of its net sales.  The  impact  and  management  of  risk  associated  with  the availability of products caused by climate change are described in | L'Or\u00e9al regularly revises its security inventory policies for expected risks,  anticipates  growth  scenarios,  reserves  capacities  with  its suppliers  and  negotiates  long-term  contracts  with  them.  There are business continuity plans for each operational site. The Group is currently deploying a single methodology of business continuity plans at all its factories and distribution centres. These plans aim to anticipate disruption at Group supply chain sites and ensure a timely business continuity. L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  centralised  raw  materials  team  that  uses action plans to manage and anticipate risks of raw materials not being  available,  including  seeking  alternative  sources  and reviewing  formula  design.

The scarcity of resources and the implementation of the transition towards a low-carbon economy could also increase production costs (such as the increased cost of recycled plastic packaging).\n\nInsufficient  consideration  during  product  design  related  to  the impact  of  their  usage  by  consumers  could  represent  a  risk  for sales in certain areas of the world affected by water stress or the lack  of  adapted  infrastructures  to  collect  and  treat  waste  and wastewater.\n\nConsumer choices could be increasingly influenced by the impact associated  with  the  use  of  a  product  (its  carbon  footprint,  its water  footprint,  its  impact  on  biodiversity)  and  by  the  Group's overall  environmental  performance,  particularly  in  terms  of reducing its CO2 emissions in all Scopes.\n\nIf  the  Group  did  not  sufficiently  anticipate  all  these  impacts  and did not initiate a voluntary process to reduce and adapt to climate change, its financial and non-financial performance as well as its reputation could be impacted.\n\nTaking  into  account  environmental  challenges,  and  in  particular efforts to combat climate change, is an integral part of L'Or\u00e9al's business model\n\nBuilding  on  its  previous  achievements,  the  Group  announced  in June  2020  a  second  generation  of  particularly  ambitious  and specific objectives for 2030 as part of its L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. These objectives cover the CO2 emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3 that are generated by the Group's activities, and commit to  a  Science-Based  Targets  (SBT)  approach,  so  as  to  track  the 1.5\u00b0C  trajectory  by  2050.  These  commitments  were  validated  in 2017 by the SBT initiative:\n\n- \u00b7 by  2025,  the  Group  will  reach  100%  renewable  energy (1) at  all operated sites;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  the  Group  will  have  reduced  all  its  greenhouse  gas emissions by 25% in absolute value compared to 2016 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3); and\n- \u00b7 as a signatory of the UN pledge 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C', L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  to  reach  net  zero  emissions by 2050.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  commits  that  by  2030  all  water  used  in  the  Group's industrial  processes  would  be  recycled  and  reused  on  its  sites, prioritising  the  deployment  of  the  required  equipment  according to  the  water  situation  of  the  watersheds  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al operates.  Management  of  potential  consequences  of  extreme events is described in the section on 'Product availability' risk.\n\nThe Group also launched a programme entitled Green Sciences to evolve  its  raw  material  portfolio  the  development  of  ingredients with  a  favourable  environmental  profile,  in  minimising  the environmental impacts associated with growing plants sources of these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion,  consequences  on biodiversity, for example), and by relying on ecofriendly processes that prevent upstream pollution.\n\nTo  inform  its  consumers  and  enable  them  to  make  more sustainable  consumer  choices,  the  Group  is  developing  an environmental  display  system  for  its  products,  with  a  rating ranging from A to E, which takes into account 14 factors of impact for  the  planet,  including  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  This  system has been deployed across 12 of the Group's brands in 32 countries in Europe, North America and China.\n\nAt the same time, L'Or\u00e9al actively contributes to the collaborative work of the EcoBeautyScore Consortium, which aims to develop a standardised scoring system across the entire industry.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  priorities  and  the  main  commitments  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future  programme  are  described  in  chapter  4,  which  specifically comprises the information disclosed in the Non-Financial Performance Statement, including the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\n<!-- image -->",

The occurrence of such events could have a financial, operational and/ or reputational impact.\n\nThe Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy aims to minimise the impact on the environment and guarantee the health and  safety  of  employees,  customers  and  the  communities  in which L'Or\u00e9al carries out its activities. As a result of this policy, the risks inherent  in  our  business  activities  are  systematically identified and brought under control.\n\nThe Operations Department issues internal rules that set out the principles of L'Or\u00e9al's EHS policy. Each site is covered by an EHS officer.  EHS  risk  management  programmes,  methods  and  tools are implemented and the corresponding learning programmes are being  rolled  out  systematically.  EHS  performance  indicators  are collected  monthly  from  all  factories,  distribution  centres,  and administrative  and  research  sites  with  over  50  people.  Specific audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS  teams,  and  external independent experts. The fire risk is controlled by very strict fire prevention  standards  (National  Fire  Protection  Association standards or equivalent).\n\nIndustrial  sites  classified  as  'Seveso'  are  subject  to  specific procedures adapted to the nature of the risks related to storage of  chemicals  or  flammable  materials  and  are  in  compliance  with the regulations. Since 2020, the Group has extended compliance with  the  main  requirements  of  the  European  Seveso  Directive beyond the European Union to all sites it operates worldwide.\n\nAcross all its sites, the Group strives to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, its water consumption and its waste generation and to limit  the  impact  of  its  activity  on  biodiversity.  It  also  pledges  to reduce the footprint from transportation of its products and to no longer send waste to landfill.\n\nDetails of how the risk relating to the temporary unavailability of an industrial  site  is  managed  are  given  in  the  section  relating  to 'Product availability'.",

Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks/Risk of non-conformity\n\n## Risk identification\n\nRisk management\n\nMany  general  and  specific  laws  and  regulations  apply  to  the Group,  such  as  the  European  REACH  and  CLP  (Classification, Labelling,  Packaging)  regulations  intended  to  strengthen  the human  and  environmental  safety  of  chemical  products,  the European  Cosmetics  Directive  governing  animal  testing  of ingredients,  legislation  on  competition  law,  corruption  and  the control  of  international  flows,  including  economic  sanctions policies. The  diversity  and  constant  reinforcement  of  the regulatory  environment  expose  the  Group  to  a  risk  of  nonconformity or increased compliance costs.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  remains  exposed  to  the  risk  of  default  or  fraud,  which could have an impact on its reputation, its business activities and its  results.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  its  business,  the  Group  will potentially  be  involved  in  all  types  of  legal  actions  and  may  be subject to tax, customs and administrative audits.\n\nIn accordance with its Code of Ethics, L'Or\u00e9al attaches particular importance  to  compliance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  that apply  to  it.  This  obligation  to  comply  with  local  legislation  is reaffirmed specifically in the Group's Legal Charter, which sets out the rules applicable within the Group in terms of contracts, corporate law,  intellectual  property  and  competition  law,  embargoes  and economic sanctions, and protection of personal data.\n\nTo ensure compliance with these rules, the Group  has implemented  a  robust  governance  structure  involving  all  of  the Group's  operational  entities  and  support  departments.  This governance  enables  the  Group  to  monitor  legislation  on  an ongoing basis and to take any measures necessary to comply with it in a timely manner.\n\nTo  ensure  any  embargoes  are  observed,  the  Group  has  put  in place  rules  on  the  terms  of  delivery  and  transport  of  its  goods, with the aim of ensuring the control and compliance of formalities in  terms  of  customs  imports  and  exports.  Learning  programmes about customs fundamentals are also delivered to all appropriate employees  in  the  Operations  Department.  The  Group's  Legal Department has set up dedicated learning courses in competition law  for  all  appropriate  employees.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  also  involved  in  an ongoing dialogue with national or regional authorities in charge of specifically regulating products in its sector through  the professional associations to which it belongs.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  REACH  and  CLP  regulations,  L'Or\u00e9al communicates proactively with its European suppliers in order to ensure a continuing supply of compliant raw materials.\n\nAn action plan has been drawn up at L'Or\u00e9al in order to improve the  design  and  methods  used  to  assess  the  safety  of  raw materials. It led to the end of testing finished products on animals in  1989  (14  years  before  it  became  a  legal  obligation  in  Europe) and the development of predictive evaluation strategies to meet European regulations.\n\nIn the areas of fraud and corruption, the deployment to all Group subsidiaries of programmes to prevent corruption (see subsection 4.3.4.) and raise awareness of fraud risk contribute to the management of these risks.\n\nIn  terms  of  taxation,  the  Group  relies  on  a  tax  policy  and  the systems described in subsection 4.3.5.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has no knowledge of any governmental procedures, legal or arbitration proceedings, which are pending or threatened, that may have, or have had over the last 12 months, material effects on the  financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or  the Group,  other  than  those  described  in  note  12.2.  'Contingent liabilities  and  significant  ongoing  disputes'  of  the  notes  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

These  communications may  be  challenged  by  authorities,  organisations  or  consumers, despite every care used to guarantee their accuracy and fairness. Such  actions  could  affect  sales  or,  more  generally,  the  Group's financial  position,  particularly  if  claims  are  made  or  products recalled.\n\nThe  Regulatory  and  Claims  Substantiation  Department controls the  conformity  of  product  communications  before  they  are introduced on the market. The Group's Code of Ethics sets out the fundamental principles of responsible communication and L'Or\u00e9al has made a commitment to implement the International Chamber of  Commerce  Consolidated  Code  of  Advertising  and  Marketing Communication Practice and the Cosmetics Europe Charter and Guiding  Principles  on  responsible  advertising  and  marketing communication to which the key global cosmetics industry players in Europe adhere. The Group's principles for 'responsible product advertising'  are  described  in  a  summary  brochure  disseminated worldwide in order to raise employee awareness about compliance with ethical principles, specific legal and regulatory requirements, and  operational  processes  for  the  prior  control  of  product communications.\n\nSpecial  care  is  given  to  the  protection  of  trademarks,  designs, models  and  domain  names  belonging  to  the  Group.  This responsibility is entrusted  to  a  special  unit  of  the  Legal Department.  The  department  ensures  the  worldwide  protection, management  and  defence  of  intellectual  property  rights  via searches  for  prior  rights,  monitoring  of  registration  and  renewal procedures,  the  implementation  of  monitoring  services  and  the initiation of appropriate legal action against counterfeiters.\n\nIn order to protect the Group against the risk of appropriation of a molecule,  a  formula,  packaging,  an  application  system  or  an application  by  another  company,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  the International Industrial Property Department, a specific structure which is part of the Research and Innovation Department.\n\nThis Department is responsible for filing the Group's patents, their use and defence on a worldwide basis. It also conducts studies on the free use of Group products with regard to third-party patents and monitors the legality of competitors' products with regard to the Group's patents.\n\nThe Group is also an active member of organisations which have set themselves  the  goal  of  combating  counterfeiting  and promoting  best  commercial  practices.  This  is  the  case  of  the UNIFAB (Union  des  Fabricants) ,  the  APRAM (Association  des Praticiens du Droit des Marques et des Mod\u00e8les) and the AIM.",

Financial and market risks\n\n## Financial and market risks/Inflation and currency risk\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nDue to its international presence, L'Or\u00e9al is naturally exposed to currency fluctuations. In addition, commercial flows resulting from purchases  and  sales  of  items,  products,  royalties  and  services arise between subsidiaries in different countries. Procurement by subsidiaries is mainly in the currency of the supplier's country.\n\nFluctuations between the main currencies may therefore have an impact on the results of the subsidiaries, but also on the Group's results  during  the  conversion  of  non-euro  subsidiaries'  accounts into  euros  and,  as  a  result,  make  it  difficult  to  compare performances between two financial years.\n\nFurthermore,  as  a  result  of  the  inflation  situation,  the  Group  is exposed  to  increased  volatility  in  global  currencies  and  to  an increase in the cost of its supplies, in particular.\n\nThe impact of hedging on equity and the analysis of sensitivity to currency fluctuations are detailed in note 11.3. 'Other comprehensive income' in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Finally,  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  the income  statement  is  described  in  note  10.2.  'Foreign  exchange gains and losses' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial and market risks/Financial equity risk\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe main equity risk for L'Or\u00e9al is the 9.35% stake it held in Sanofi at  31  December  2023  (see  note  9.3.  'Non-current  financial assets'  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements),  the  value  of which fluctuates primarily as a function of global market trends, Sanofi's results and, more generally, economic and financial data from Sanofi and its sector.\n\nThis interest and changes in the market in which Sanofi operates are  monitored  on  a  regular  basis.  As  at  31  December  2023,  the market value of the Sanofi share was significantly higher than the value  recorded  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  balance  sheet  (see  note  9.3.  'Noncurrent financial assets' to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nA  significant  decrease  in  the  amount  of  the  dividend  paid  by Sanofi,  or  a  significant  or  extended  decline  in  its  market  price, could have an impact on L'Or\u00e9al's share price.\n\n## Financial and market risks/Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  intangible  assets,  which  are  primarily  its  37  major international  brands,  and  the  goodwill  recognised  at  the  time  of external growth transactions, are susceptible to impairment.\n\nAs  detailed  in  note  7.  'Intangible  assets'  of  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements,  brands  with  an  indefinite  useful  life  and goodwill are not amortised but are tested for periodic impairment at least once a year. Where the recoverable amount of a brand is lower  than  its  net  carrying  amount,  an  impairment  loss  is recognised.  Similarly,  any  difference  between  the  recoverable amount  of  each  cash-generating  unit  and  the  net  carrying amount  of  the  assets  including  goodwill  would  lead  to  an impairment  loss  in  respect  of  the  asset,  recorded  in  the  income statement. This is reported to the Audit Committee. The amounts for  the  last  three  financial  years  are  provided  in  note  4.  'Other operational  income  and  expenses'  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nThe data and assumptions used in impairment tests carried out on Cash-Generating  Units  for  which  the  goodwill  and  nonamortisable  brands  are  significant,  are  presented  in  note  7.3. 'Impairment  tests  on  intangible  assets'  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  Treasury  and  Finance  Charter  specifies,  in  particular,  the principles  to  be  applied  by  Group  entities  to  ensure  that management of currency risk is both prudent and centralised.\n\nTo limit currency risk, the Group applies a predetermined strategy whereby it hedges a significant portion of its annual requirements for  the  following  year  through  currency  forward  contracts (purchases or sales) or through options. Hedging requirements are established  for  the  following  year  on  the  basis  of  operating budgets of each subsidiary. These requirements are then reviewed regularly  throughout  the  year  in  progress  and  the  hedging  is adjusted.  In  order  to  obtain  better  visibility  over  the  flows generated,  the  management  of  currency  risk  is  centralised through  the  Treasury  and  Finance  Department  at  head  office (part of the Group Corporate Finance Department), which uses a specific  tool  for  centralising  the  subsidiaries'  requirements  by currency (FX report).\n\nThe system of foreign exchange risk hedging is presented to the Audit  Committee.  The  hedging  methodology  and  the  equities involved are described in note 10.1. 'Hedging of currency risk' of the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is adjusted according to the economic and financial situation.\n\nIn  addition,  the  management  tools  developed  can  be  used  to mitigate  the  impact  of  inflationary  tensions  through  product recovery strategies and sourcing adaptation strategies.\n\n## Risk factors and risk management\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is the Group's Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n## 4.1. Introduction\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  ambition  is  to  combine  financial  performance  with  social  and  environmental  performance,  which  are  now  more inextricably linked than ever. This ambition forms the backbone of the Group's strategy.\n\n## 4.1.1. Sustainability for sustained success\n\nFor many years now, L'Or\u00e9al has been working hard to reduce its impact  on  the  environment  and  make  a  positive contribution  to  society .  Sustainability  is  a  key  pillar  of  the Group's  transformation  and  a  strategic  priority.  Therefore Management as  a  whole  and  all  its  teams  implement  an ambitious CSR policy.\n\n- In 2013 , the Group  launched  its first comprehensive sustainability  programme , Sharing Beauty With All. Through this programme, the Group underwent a thorough transformation to reduce its impact on its value chain, by reinventing  the  way  it  designs  and  manufactures  its  products, with sustainability as its fundamental requirement.\n\nIn  2015 ,  the  Group  started defining Science-Based  Targets (SBT),  set  according  to  the  +1.5\u00b0C  pathway ,  to  reduce  its greenhouse  gas  emissions  over  its  value  chain  and  over  the long term, following the Paris Agreement on climate change. In  December  2017,  the  SBT  initiative  (SBTi)  approved  the Group's commitment to reduce its Scope 1, 2, and 3 compared with  2016.  The  Group  decided  to  adopt  a  similar  scientific approach  to  define  its  objectives  in  terms  of  water management,  biodiversity  protection  and  natural  resources preservation.\n\n## 4.1.2. CSR governance\n\nTo  support  this  process,  the  Group  has  developed  a  strong governance structure.\n\nThe Board  of  Directors determines  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategic orientations annually. These orientations account for climate change and sustainability matters more generally, as well as the  Group's  purpose  to  'Create  the  beauty  that  moves  the world'.  To  monitor  how  these  strategic  orientations  are defined and successfully implemented, the Board of Directors relies  on  its  four Board  Committees to  investigate  matters within their area of expertise for determining and monitoring the non-financial strategy (see subsection 2.3.4.). Every year, the  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  reports  on  the Group's  activities  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and  attends Strategy and Sustainability Committee meetings. Before each meeting,  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  receive a status update detailing specific advances in the L'Or\u00e9al for\n\nThus, in  2020 ,  the  Group  formalised  its  commitments  in its second,  even  more  ambitious,  sustainability  programme for 2030, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future. This programme addresses all impacts  of  the  Group  associated  with  its  value  chain:  from research  on  ingredients  to  sourcing  of  raw  materials,  from packaging  conception  to  production,  from  manufacturing  to transportation of products, as well as  consumption, and end of life.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  which  is  subject  to  public  reporting every year, is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 transforming  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities , in  order  to  limit  their impact on the climate, water, biodiversity and resources;\n- \u00b7 empowering the Group's business ecosystem and helping it transition to a more sustainable world ; and\n- \u00b7 contributing  to  solving  global  challenges by  supporting urgent social and environmental needs.\n\nThis  programme  guides  both  the  internal  transformation  of the Group and that of its external stakeholders, as well as its contribution to the most pressing global challenges.\n\nIn  october  2023,  in  accordance  with  the  new  SBTi  Net-Zero framework,  the  Group  has  updated  its  decarbonization trajectories for 2030 and 2050. At the time of approval of the Management Report kby the Board of  Directors,  the  Group was still awaiting SBTi's approval of these trajectories. These will be published in the 2024  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nthe Future programme. In October 2022, the Directors took a specific CSR learning course. The Directors are well informed about strategic challenges, including those linked to CSR (see subsection 2.3.2.).\n\nThe comprehensive transformation plan affects all Divisions, Zones  and  support  functions.  To  implement  it,  the  Chief Executive Officer relies on the commitment of every member of the Executive Committee in  their field of responsibility. He works  with  the  Executive  Committee  to  implement  nonfinancial strategic orientations. There are regular updates on sustainability matters so that the necessary action plans can be  defined  and  implemented.  A network  of sustainability leaders , members of the Management Committees, administers L'Or\u00e9al for the Future in each Division, Zone and entity.",

        "page_content": "On the Executive Committee, the Chief Corporate Responsibility  Officer ensures  that  the  measures  the  Group takes  to  integrate  sustainability  across  its  entire  value  chain are  strategically  consistent  with  its  charitable  contributions. Using  the  action  plans  that  have  been  introduced,  she formulates and  implements  the  sustainability strategy, and assesses and manages risks and opportunities related to environmental and societal challenges at Group level. In April 2023,  the  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  presented L'Or\u00e9al's Sustainability strategy, including climate change, to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nUnder her direction, different internal Committees related to sustainability define  the  roadmaps  for  each  of  the  entities represented  (Operations,  Research  &  Innovation,  Divisions, Zones). The  experts  responsible  for  administering  the programme are on these Committees, each of which defines annual objectives and oversees how they are rolled out across the value chain.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwice  a  year,  the  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer invites  some Executive Committee members to a meeting of the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  Executive  Committee to  make strategic decisions about the programme.\n\nCreated  in  2020,  the  mission  of  the Sustainable Finance Department is to integrate the environmental challenges from a financial standpoint. It reports to the Chief Financial Officer and to the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer. It aims to develop  and  then  manage  Sustainable  Finance  actions  by coordinating  actions  within  the  finance  teams  and  further incorporating  sustainability  into  investment  and  acquisition decisions.\n\nLaunched  in  2021,  the Sustainable  Tech  Department was expanded  in  2023  to  incorporate  a  digital  component.  The mission  of the Sustainable  Digital  &  Tech Department  is  to measure the environmental footprint of our Digital and Tech activities, while developing and implementing decarbonisation pathways  towards  reducing  carbon  intensity  with  concrete roadmaps and reduction targets. This Department reports to the Beauty Tech Department and CMO.\n\n## 4.1.3. A strategic transformation driven by all\n\nSustainability  must  be  driven  by  all  teams.  All L'Or\u00e9al employees are encouraged to complete learning programmes on  the  challenges  of  sustainability.  They  have  access  to  a comprehensive range of online learning courses as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. These learning courses are available in 15 languages.\n\nRemuneration  structures  have  been  revised  at  the  highest level.  The variable  portion  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's annual remuneration incorporates quantitative and qualitative non-financial targets, including objectives associated  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (and previously the Sharing Beauty with All programme). In order to ensure  strong  correlation  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  for  which economic and social performance go hand-in-hand, the longterm remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, and that of more  than  2,000  other  recipients  of  performance  shares, includes  criteria  for  non-financial  performance  in  addition to financial performance (see sections 2.4 and 7.4.). Moreover, non-financial  targets  in  line  with  the  Group's  sustainability goals  have  since  2016  been  included  in  the variable remuneration of the top management, including international brand managers and country managers.\n\nWithin the framework of ongoing dialogue and in the spirit of continual progress, L'Or\u00e9al considers its stakeholders' expectations . With  a  worldwide  representative  panel  of outside  experts,  the  Group  has  defined  and  developed  a method of ad-hoc interaction deemed the most efficient and appropriate.  It  has  also  set  up  bodies  to  consider  important issues.  These  bodies  aim  to ensure  that  civil  society's expectations are sufficiently met with regard to these issues.

This analysis is based on the double materiality principle that is  fully  enshrined  in  the  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive  (CSRD),  which  defines  materiality  in  two  different dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 financial materiality (the risks and opportunities sustainability  issues  pose  for  the  development,  position  or financial performance of a company); and\n- \u00b7 impact materiality (the potential impact a company has on people or the environment).\n\nIn 2023, L'Or\u00e9al launched an update to this double materiality analysis to align it line with the final version of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) adopted on 31 July 2023. This process has helped to determine the data points to be published in 2025 under the CSRD.\n\nIdentification,  evaluation  and  ranking  of  issues: first,  an analysis  of  the  key  environmental,  social  and  governance (ESG)  topics  was  conducted,  regardless  of  whether  these topics are covered by the ESRS or are specific to L'Or\u00e9al or\n\nthe  beauty  sector.  These  were  then  subjected  to  a  double financial materiality and impact materiality analysis through:\n\n- \u00b7 a documentary  review to  incorporate  materiality  and financial  impact  data  as  well  as  the  perspectives  of numerous L'Or\u00e9al's stakeholders, in particular by considering the opinions of: employees, via the annual Pulse survey  on  L'Or\u00e9al  employee  engagement;  consumers, through  consumer  surveys  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the external third party; investors, via the review of international  standards  (SASB  in  particular)  and  nonfinancial  rating  agencies,  including  MSCI,  S&P  Global, Moody's ESG Solutions, Sustainalytics;\n- \u00b7 workshops  with  in-house  ESG  experts to  incorporate  the Group's operational and strategic perspectives; and\n- \u00b7 interviews  with  external  ESG  experts (clients,  investors, representatives of civil society, NGOs, professional associations).\n\nFollowing  this  analysis,  the  issues  were  classified  according  to their financial and impact materiality.\n\nResults and action plans: all the issues identified in the matrix have,  for  the  most  part,  already  been  identified  within  the framework of programmes such as L'Or\u00e9al for the Future or L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care . This analysis was shared with the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee in 2022.\n\n| Main ESG issues                                                                                                                       | Examples of policies and action plans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Document section                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Environmental issues:  circular economy,  preservation of natural  resources (packaging,  formulas), climate,  water and biodiversity | 'Transforming our business' pillar of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future  programme:  \u00b7 Climate:  reducing greenhouse gas emissions from sites, strategic suppliers, product transportation and consumers; \u00b7 Water:  ensuring  that  formulas  are  respectful  of  all  aquatic  ecosystems and that water in factories is recycled or reused; | 1.4.2 Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR): shared  and lasting growth; L'Or\u00e9al for the Future: 2023  Results.                                             |\n| Safety of ingredients  and product  compliance, including  transparency  and action on the  safety of new                             | \u00b7 Safety assessment process:   standards that govern product quality from design  and  production  to  distribution  (100%  of  products  subject  to rigorous  assessment,  the  Environmental  Safety  department,  safety testing) \u00b7 'Inside our Products' website                                                                   | 4.3.1.3.2.

Ongoing stakeholder dialogue\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  ongoing  dialogue  and  as  part  of  a process aimed  at  making  continual  progress, L'Or\u00e9al endeavours to take into account its stakeholders' expectations  in  its  strategy.  The  Group  has  defined  and developed  a  method  of  ad-hoc interaction,  that  it  considers the  most  efficient  and  appropriate,  for  all  the  stakeholders involved. The  dialogue  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  with  its stakeholders has grown in importance over time.\n\nConsulted throughout the Group's first sustainability programme, Sharing Beauty with All , they were then involved in  both  the  definition  of  commitments  and  during  their\n\nfollow-up. From April 2019, seven internal expert groups came together  to  prepare  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme for 2030.  They  coordinated independent  studies and collaborated with  external  partners  and  civil  society .  Their mission  was  to  define  the  Group's  next  steps.  These consultations resulted in ambitious and quantifiable targets to reduce the Group's impact and make a positive contribution to its ecosystem. For a large number of global environmental and societal issues, ongoing exchanges with NGOs, associations  and  experts  allow  the  Group  to  compare  and ensure the appropriateness of its policies, and action plans.\n\n|                           | Current Relationships                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Some initiatives in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees                 | L'Or\u00e9al  sets  up  a  large  number  of  dialogue arrangements  with  its  employees  to  ensure their  health,  safety  and  well-being  at  work, while listening to their concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | More than 37,000 people logged on to Ethics Day sessions and more than 6,600 questions were asked worldwide.

Main non-financial risks\n\nL'Or\u00e9al presents its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy (1) in  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Non-Financial Reporting Directive (2) in particular. This Statement sets out the Group's  main  non-financial  risks  and  describes  the  policies implemented to address them.\n\nPerformance indicators follow and measure these policies as well  as  their  results.  This  presentation  refers  to  the  Group's business model, set out in subsection 1.3.1. As L'Or\u00e9al has had a  long-standing  commitment  to  CSR,  section  4.3.  also incorporates the policies and actions voluntarily implemented beyond a response to the main risks.\n\n## 4.2.1. Risk identification process\n\nThe main environmental and social risks, the main risks related to human rights and the main corruption risks (3) are detailed (4) to  the  extent  necessary  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the Company's  position,  business  development,  economic  and financial results, and impacts of its activity.\n\nChapter 3 presents the Group's significant risks, i.e. risks that cover all areas of the Group's activities and that could have a material impact on its business, financial position or outlook. They have been established in conjunction with the Group risk mapping (see subsection 3.5.2.).\n\nSome of these risks are specific to non-financial issues. Others are  broader  and  may  stem  from  environmental  or  societal causes: these are the CSR risks. The principal ones have been selected within the meaning of the NFRD following a detailed analysis.  This  analysis  was  carried  out  based  on  the  work\n\nof  Group  experts,  in  conjunction  with  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department and in compliance with the Group's business  model.  This  work  also  draws  on  the  double materiality  analysis  carried  out  by  the  Group  based  on interviews with its stakeholders (interviews with in-house and external  ESG  experts,  see  section  4.1.),  the  climate  study  on environmental risks, the Group's Human Rights and corruption mapping,  and  corruption  mapping  conducted  for  each country. It  takes  into  account  the  risk  analysis  carried  out  in connection with the Vigilance Plan (see section 3.4.).\n\nThe  risks  associated  with  climate  change  are  subject  to  a long-term  approach  -  more  than  10  years  -  given  their specific  nature.  The  main  risks  have  been  validated  at  the highest  level  of  responsibility  of  the  organisation  by  the relevant General Managements.\n\n## 4.2.2. Main risks for corporate social responsibility, human rights and corruption\n\nThe main risks in respect of CSR, human rights and corruption identified  by  the  Group  are  detailed  below.  Other  risks, of which the Group is not currently aware or which it does not consider  material  at  present,  could  have  a  negative  impact. The  approach  is  based  on  double  materiality:  the  concept\n\nof risk covers both risks related to the impact of the Group's business activities on its ecosystem and the risks of the impact of  climate  change  in  the  short  and  medium-term  on  its business model, activity and financial performance (5) .",

        "page_content": "## MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\n\n## Industrial risks\n\nAs with any production, distribution, research and general administration activity, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to a variety of industrial risks that may impact the environment and safety: fires,  explosions,  technical  failure  of  facilities,  safety  systems,  or  even  human  failure  in  the operation  of  existing  facilities  (such  as  those  dedicated  to  wastewater  treatment  and/or  discharge),  or  when  managing  exceptional works. These events can generate accidental pollution (surface and underground water, air, soils etc.) and have consequences inside or outside  the  sites,  which  are  sometimes  located  near  an  inhabited  area.  Given  its  industrial  activity,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  also  exposed  to  risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its own operations (Scopes 1  and  2  under  the GHG Protocol) or generated within  its  value  chain,  particularly  from  production  by  its  suppliers  of  the  raw  materials  or  packaging  components  required  to manufacture its products (Scope 3 upstream) and from the transportation and subsequent use of its products by consumers (Scope 3 downstream).\n\n## Physical and transition risks associated with climate change\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks of natural origin in many countries. Risks of natural origin are those related to the occurrence of extreme weather events such as cyclones or floods, or those resulting from long-term climate change such as the rise in average temperatures, noticeable change in precipitation levels and the reduction of available water. The increase in these risks could impact the availability of finished products by disturbing the Group's operations and/or supply chain. To be sold, the products manufactured by the Group must be available on the market on the dates scheduled to respect consumer demands and launch plans, in a cosmetics market where the need for responsiveness is growing constantly. A major stoppage of activity at a factory or distribution centre could therefore have an adverse effect on the achievement of commercial objectives.\n\nThese risks may impact the Group directly on its sites, or indirectly via the sites of suppliers and subcontractors, thereby reducing the availability of raw materials or filling and packing components necessary to manufacture products. For instance, an exceptionally steep rise  in  the  price  of  basic  raw  materials because of their scarcity, or in the energy costs necessary for their production due to carbon taxation, or even their total unavailability or the resulting failure of suppliers, could affect the Group's performance.\n\n## Risks related to the use and end of use of products\n\nThe use and subsequent disposal of cosmetic products by consumers and professional customers (mainly hairdressers and beauticians) generate environmental impacts. This mainly concerns the use of water and plastic. So-called 'rinsed' formulas, shampoos in particular, require water for their use, and the ingredients used in their composition can be found after use in domestic wastewater. The treatment of this water is dependent on existing sanitation systems in the relevant geographic zones. Insufficient consideration of these usagephase impacts during product design could represent a risk in certain areas of the world affected by water stress or the lack of adapted infrastructures  for  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  Similarly,  the  use  of  predominantly  plastic  containers  may  represent  an environmental risk with regard to the disposal of plastic waste, depending largely on the collection and treatment channels available.\n\n## Risk related to changing stakeholder and consumer expectations in terms of environmental performance\n\nThe choices made by certain categories of consumers may be increasingly influenced by the impact associated with the use of a product (its carbon footprint, its water footprint, its impact on biodiversity) and by the Group's overall environmental performance, particularly in terms of reducing its CO2 emissions in all Scopes. If the Group is unable to anticipate changes in such behaviours, meet stakeholders' expectations,  overcome  major  environmental  and  social  challenges  and  respond  with  appropriate  product  innovation,  a  significant contribution in the transition towards a low carbon economy and the preservation of water, natural resources and biodiversity within its value chain, the Group's performance and reputation could be affected.\n\n## Risk of regulatory non-conformity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates through subsidiaries located in many countries. Like any international business, L'Or\u00e9al is subject to a wide range of constantly  changing  local  laws  and  regulations  in  the  areas  of  safety  and  the  environment.  This  mainly  concerns  efforts  to  combat climate change, and the preservation of water resources, biodiversity and natural resources. This exposes it to the risk of regulatory nonconformity or higher compliance costs for its activities in a global context of increasingly diverse standards.\n\n## MAIN SOCIAL RISKS\n\n## Employee health and safety risk\n\nGiven L'Or\u00e9al's activities, particularly its industrial operations, there could be a risk of occupational injuries or illnesses. Psychosocial risks may affect employees' mental health. This could also have an adverse impact on their commitment and, consequently, on the Group's performance.\n\n## Human resources management risk\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is evolving within a complex, highly competitive and rapidly changing environment (globalisation, diversity and inclusion challenges, sustainability issues, acceleration of the digital transformation etc.) that requires specific expertise. The Covid-19 health crisis has had a significant impact on the job market, with new employee expectations, particularly with the introduction of a sustainable hybrid mode, alternating between on-site and remote working. If L'Or\u00e9al fails to identify, attract, recruit, retain and develop competent and involved employees who behave responsibly within diverse teams, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## MAIN HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS\n\nThe Group expanded its mapping by identifying the potential salient human rights risks worldwide and in all markets. L'Or\u00e9al relied on the  reporting  framework  of  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP  Reporting  Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale and remediability, as well as the likelihood of its impacts for people throughout its value chain. This study was conducted with an NGO specialised in the subject providing an independent analysis, and was reviewed by different external stakeholders. The most salient human rights risks are:\n\n- \u00b7 discrimination against Group employees or workers within its value chains on grounds of gender, age, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation;\n- \u00b7 child labour within the Group's value chain and our raw materials supply chain;\n- \u00b7 modern slavery within the Group's value chain and our raw materials supply chain;\n- \u00b7 non-payment of living wage in the value chain;\n- \u00b7 a lack of worker voice mechanisms, social dialogue, freedom of association and collective bargaining in our value chain;\n- \u00b7 the mental health of Group employees; and\n- \u00b7 the contribution to reinforcing gender stereotypes via advertising.\n\nOther  potential  risks  identified  concern  the  possibility  of  failures  in  product  quality  or  safety  or  in  data  protection,  respect  for  the environment, the right to access water, consideration of human rights in the choice of raw materials and, in particular, respect for free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.\n\n## MAIN CORRUPTION RISKS\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates in many countries where the risk of corruption can be significant and could lead L'Or\u00e9al's employees, as well as third parties acting in its name or on its behalf, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, to adopt practices contrary to the Group's ethical  principles  and  the  prevailing  regulations.  Corruption  takes  a  variety  of  forms  that  are  not  necessarily  easy  for  employees  to identify. For instance, the exchange of gifts or invitations of excessive value could be perceived as corruption.\n\nCorruption risk is  assessed by specific mapping, carried out at the Group level and by each country in its local context. The Group's activities involve in particular relations with:\n\n- \u00b7 public authorities and their representatives, either directly or via intermediaries or professional bodies, to obtain the authorisations necessary for the Group's activities, for instance. The countries in which the Group operates must be given support in the fight against public corruption;\n- \u00b7 the Group's customers and suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 journalists, doctors etc., to whom products can be given so that they can recommend them. Relationships are also maintained with third  parties  that,  beyond  the  Group's  products  themselves,  issue  various  or  general  opinions  on  L'Or\u00e9al.  Any  action  potentially deemed as being intended to cause the persons in question to breach their obligation of loyalty must be avoided.\n\nAny breach of the Group's corruption prevention principles may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al and its partners. Equally, any failure of a partner may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## 4.3. Policies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe Group's policies address the need to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of the main CSR risks  and  aim  to  contribute to its  sustainable  growth in  a  control  environment  aligned with  its  businesses.  There  are  however  limits  inherent  in  any system and process. These limits result from several factors,\n\n## 4.3.1. An ambitious environmental policy\n\nThe  Group  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  reducing  its environmental  footprint  and  aspires  to  be  one  of  the  most exemplary  companies  in  this  field. L'Or\u00e9al wishes to decorrelate  growth  and  environmental  impact.  L'Or\u00e9al  also wishes  to  contribute  positively  to  its  ecosystem  throughout the  world,  particularly  through  its  impact  funds,  brand commitments,  and  social  programmes  such  as  the Inclusive Sourcing programme.\n\n- \u00b7 In  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  launches  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme, based on four pillars: 'Innovating sustainably', 'Producing sustainably', 'Living sustainably' and 'Developing sustainably'\n\nsuch  as  external  uncertainties,  or  issues  resulting  from technical  or  human  failures.  These  policies  also  reflect  a proactive  approach  by  the  Group  to  consider  stakeholder expectations (see subsection 4.1.5.).\n\n- \u00b7 In  2016,  the Working Sustainably programme is rolled  out within Sharing  Beauty  with  All to  integrate  administrative sites  and  research  centres  to  mitigate  environmental  and social impacts\n- \u00b7 In 2017, L'Or\u00e9al joins the Science-Based Targets programme, an initiative of CDP, the United Nations Global Compact,  the World  Resources  Institute,  and  the  NGO WWF.  The  Group  thereby  plans  to  reduce  its  overall greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25%  compared  with  2016 by the end of 2030",

A strategy and ambitions centred on sustainability\n\n## 4.3.1.1.1. An ambitious EHS policy shared by all\n\nA  pioneering,  socially  responsible  company,  L'Or\u00e9al  applies an ambitious Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy to minimise its  environmental impact and guarantee the health and safety of employees (2) , customers, and the communities in which it carries out its business activities.\n\nThis  has  been  reflected,  for  many  years,  in  the  desire  to systematically control the risks related to the safety of people and the environment that are inherent in the Group's business activities.  A  risk  assessment  and  action  plans  aim  to  reduce the potential impacts of:\n\n- \u00b7 any establishment or renovation of a site;\n- \u00b7 any  introduction  of  new  equipment  or  manufacturing processes; and\n- \u00b7 any modification of industrial processes.\n\nThis  commitment  has  led  to  the  deployment  of  the  Group's EHS policy over the entire spectrum of its business activities, but  also  beyond  it.  Indeed,  the  Group  strives  to  ensure  the regulatory compliance of its activities and compliance with its standards  on  its  sites  (industrial  or  administrative  sites, research  centres,  stores).  The  Group  also  ensures  that  its subcontractors and suppliers respect the safety of people and the  environment  through  a  specifically  dedicated  audit programme.",

Every site  operated  by  the  Group  can  refer  to  it  using  the  EHS manual.  While  knowledge  of  and  compliance  with  these procedures are fundamental, the lasting improvement of the safety  results  and  environmental  performance  primarily requires  the  dissemination  of  a  sustainable  EHS  culture  to every employee. The  Group  implements  major  action programmes to improve the safety and environmental impact of its activities. A dedicated learning programme imparts this EHS  culture  to  every  level  of  the  organisation.  Lastly,  a\n\ncontext-appropriate audit system combining both a 'risk' and a 'culture' evaluation ensures that activities comply with the main  regulatory  requirements,  that  Group  standards  are properly applied and that the EHS culture is disseminated.\n\n## A worldwide organisation\n\nUnder  the  responsibility  of  Operations,  EHS  is  organised  to cover  the  Group's  worldwide  presence.

The Green steps for all course, in particular,  has  raised  awareness  of  the  challenges  related to  climate,  water,  biodiversity,  and  resources  among  more than 45,000  employees . Following  this  first  worldwide campaign to raise awareness of global challenges, a second wave of learning was launched worldwide in May 2023 with Going  Sustainable  Together. This  drills  down  on  the  specific challenges  faced  by  the  Group's  various  functions  and specifically  highlights  the  drivers  of  transformation  for  each business line. This learning module has been delivered to more than 32,000 employees since May 2023.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specialised  learning  sessions,  every  new L'Or\u00e9al  employee  completes  general  and  position-specific learning  programmes  about  the  Group's  EHS  rules  before taking up their position.\n\n## A worldwide audit programme\n\nTo ensure compliance with the Group's EHS policy, a system of worldwide audits has been in place since 1996. Since 2001, this has been reinforced by the presence of external auditors, who  are  experts  in  local  contexts  and  regulations.  These audits take place regularly at L'Or\u00e9al sites: every three years for  production  sites  and  distribution  centres  and  every  four years for administrative sites and research centres. A followup visit is scheduled for the following year if necessary.\n\nThere  are  two  types  of  audits:  'risk'  and  'culture'  audits. They  are  performed  depending  on  the  maturity,  and  type of activity at the sites.\n\nRisk  audits  are  carried  out  by  external  and  independent experts. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance  of  practices  and  facilities  with  the  significant requirements  of  local  regulations,  and  Group  procedures and rules;\n- \u00b7 control  of  risks  to  health,  safety  and  the  environment generated by technical equipment, processes and operating modes available for use by employees; and\n- \u00b7 progress in environmental, health, and safety performances.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  give  the  Group's  General Management objective knowledge of the risks in the areas of EHS on L'Or\u00e9al sites and provide the assurance that they are under control.\n\nCulture  audits  are  carried  out  by  internal  EHS  specialists through  interviews  with  at  least  20%  to  30%  of  the  site's workforce. The leadership of site management, all operational managers and the deployment level of the EHS culture with all employees are evaluated.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  provide  information  on  the knowledge  of  EHS  management  tools  and  the  maturity of sites with regard to the safety and environment culture at all structural levels.\n\nDepending  on  the  case,  EHS  audits  are  exclusively  risk or  culture  audits,  audits  that  combine  risks  and  culture,  or even audits that combine risks, culture, quality and performance.\n\nFurthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  with  its  subcontractors  the objective  of  improving  EHS  performance.  Audits  are  carried out by independent third-party specialists in addition to social audits.  They  are  conducted  on  manufacturing  or  logistics subcontracting  sites,  according  to  the  criteria  defined  by L'Or\u00e9al and similar to those used for the Group's entities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, 10 factories in seven countries were inspected for environmental risks.  In  2023,  fire  prevention inspections were carried out in 15 sites (four factories in France, and 11 sites worldwide).\n\nAll  the  preventive  audits  and  inspections  mentioned  above involved  a  risk  component  which  is  always  carried  out  by external  independent  auditors  specialised  in  the  area  being audited.\n\n## A continuous improvement process\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  standards,  the  spread  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  EHS  culture  and  the  governance  system  in  place contributes  to  the  continuous  improvement  of  the  Group's EHS  performance.  Major  developments  occurring  within  the framework  of  the  Group's  Operations  are  also  included with  this  same  goal.  The  construction  of  a  new  factory, the  purchase  of  new  equipment  or  the  definition  of  new processes are also opportunities to reduce the environmental footprint and safety risks.\n\nSome major programmes within EHS, or more generally within the Group, are vectors for progress in the areas of safety or the environment for all entities. They are therefore the subject of  detailed  improvement  plans,  the  effectiveness  of  which  is evaluated during the audits.\n\n## Life-changing Incidents or Fatality Events (LIFE) programme\n\nFor all L'Or\u00e9al sites, it covers activities posing risks that, if not controlled,  could  result  in  serious  injury  or  illness.  The  Group continues to move towards ' zero accidents ' by ensuring the sustainability  of  actions  and  defining  the  requirements  in terms of preparing for emergencies following an incident. It is backed up by a three-year communication campaign relayed by managers to cover the 10 identified families of LIFE risks.\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme\n\nWith  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed  to improving  the  environmental  footprint  of  its operated sites (1) .\n\nThe  main  environmental  objectives  of  the  programme  for operated sites are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 climate: to reach 100% renewable energy (2) for all operated sites by 2025;\n- \u00b7 water: in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be from recycled and reused sources;\n- \u00b7 biodiversity :  by 2030,  all  of  our  operated  buildings  and industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared  to  a  baseline  situation  (established  between 2019 and 2023);\n- \u00b7 natural resources: by 2030, 100% of the waste generated in  our  operated  sites  will  be  reused  or  recycled.  L'Or\u00e9al  is also committed to no longer send waste to landfills.\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  an  ISO  certification  process  in order  to  permanently  anchor  EHS  performance  on  its production sites:\n\n- \u00b7 since 2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to ISO  14001 'Environmental  Management'  certification  in  all  of  its factories;\n- \u00b7 in  2015,  the  Group  launched  an ISO  50  001 'Energy Management'  certification  programme  with  the  goal  of certifying  all  its  factories  according  to  a  clearly  defined roadmap.  Other  sites  (distribution  centres,  administrative sites and research centres) have also launched this process; and\n- \u00b7 since 2007, L'Or\u00e9al has committed to OHSAS 18 001, and then  ISO  45  001  certification 'Occupational  Health  and Safety Management' certification in all of its factories.\n\n| 2023 Certifications   | ISO 14001       | ISO 14001   | ISO 50001       | ISO 50001   | ISO 45001       | ISO 45001   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|                       | Number of sites | %           | Number of sites | %           | Number of sites | %           |\n| Factories             | 35              | 95          | 27              | 73          | 35              | 95          |\n\nAn internal communication system exists to inform each site when  accidents,  near  misses  or  significant  incidents  occur. Specific  communication  is  circulated  worldwide  to  raise awareness of the facts and lessons to be learnt, the existing\n\nrules  and  the  new  requirements  to  be  applied.  Finally,  each site  is  provided  with  an  historical  record  which  covers  the nature and root causes of EHS incidents/accidents that have occurred in all sites.",

        "page_content": "## A process of integrating new sites\n\nThe Group regularly acquires new sites. A formal integration process  ensures  that  these sites (1) are  provided  with  extra support and assistance in order for them become compliant with all EHS requirements defined, and to bring potential risks under control.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to enable these sites to rapidly achieve  the  performance  level  expected  by  the  Group. It comprises:\n\n- 1. a regulatory compliance audit carried out by an independent third party within six months of the acquisition;\n- 2. deployment of the EHS processes described above (EHS manual, EHS reporting, learning, audit programme); and\n- 3. monitoring of the integration within the Group.\n\n## 4.3.1.1.2. Managing risks and controlling the impact of operated sites (2) on their environment\n\nThe  Group  systematically  analyses  the  industrial  risks  of  its activities, specifically their environmental impact on the soils, water or air of the places where they are performed.\n\n## Analysing in order to manage and limit risks\n\nEach site has a general environmental analysis to be updated on a regular basis and whenever a significant change occurs.\n\nAll employee activities (permanent or temporary) are covered by an environmental analysis (3) . To avoid all forms of pollution (soil,  surface water, groundwater, air etc.), sites must comply with  the  preventive  measures  described  in  the  internal procedures. There are also contingency plans in the event of accidents  for  which  the  relevant  persons  are  trained. Prevention  inspections  by  insurers  and  periodic  EHS  audits verify that these measures are properly implemented.\n\nDepending  on  the  site,  if  significant  risks  are  identified  or  if L'Or\u00e9al's standards or regulations impose specific requirements, a more detailed evaluation is carried out for the activities concerned. Appropriate, and sometimes immediate, action  plans  are  implemented  to  reduce  significant  risks  to an acceptable level.\n\nA  risk  assessment  and  action  plans  aim  to  reduce  the potential impacts of:\n\n- \u00b7 any establishment or renovation of a site;\n- \u00b7 any  introduction  of  new  equipment  or  manufacturing processes; and\n- \u00b7 any changes in industrial processes.\n\nWhen  purchasing  land  or  buildings,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts due diligence,  which  includes,  in  particular,  a  review  of  the environmental aspects.\n\n## Biodiversity and land use\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  biodiversity  and  land  use  commitments  are  based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 establishing ecological inventories for sites with the aim of understanding the biodiversity of the site and, through the resulting action plan, to preserve or restore it. A local expert conducts this inventory when a lease is taken out or as part of a construction project, but also for the purposes of achieving the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future objective of operated sites;\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n- \u00b7 reducing the impact of any construction on the environment: This  involves  keeping  the  carbon  impact  of our property business to a minimum. The Group prefers to renew  our  existing  leases  or  to  lease  existing  buildings  to contribute to urban regeneration rather than urban sprawl. Where  new  buildings  or  new  leases  are  concerned, particular  attention  is  paid  to  life  cycle  analyses  (LCA)  in order  to  encourage  the  use  of  low-carbon  construction methods;\n- \u00b7 if possible,  place  the  site  on  land  located  more  than 30 metres from any wetland (sea, ponds, lakes, rivers etc.), outside  natural  areas,  public  green  spaces,  land  with endangered  or  threatened  species,  or  any  other  unbuilt areas (farmland etc.);\n- \u00b7 prevent  soil  erosion  resulting  from  wind  and/or  rainwater runoff  during  construction,  including  by  protecting  the stored arable soil layer to enable it to be reused;\n- \u00b7 maintain or restore native natural habitats and biodiversity on the built site;\n- \u00b7 maximise green or natural spaces on the site (even beyond local legal requirements), and  minimise  impermeable surfaces;\n- \u00b7 focus  on  cleaning  up  polluted  sites  (e.g.  brownfield  sites) where development is more difficult due to real or perceived environmental  contamination.  This  allows  construction  on natural or non-artificial land to be avoided; and\n- \u00b7 for  future  administrative  sites,  lease  buildings  that  are certified  LEED  Gold  or  Platinum  (or  equivalent)  in  mature real estate markets.\n\n## Surface water\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted rainwater  standards to  monitor quality  and  avoid  pollution .  For  instance,  sites  are  equipped with  oil  separators  for  parking  areas.  Similarly,  adequate retention  capacities  must  be  implemented  for  any  storage and operating area where accidental spills are liable to occur. This retention capacity must allow for fire extinguishing water to be kept at each site.\n\n## Industrial effluent\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  30  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  had  their  own effluent  treatment  plant . These  plants  use  a  range  of technologies,  including  physical,  chemical  and  biological processes, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater and local  discharge  conditions.  In  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al continued  to  increase  its  wastewater  treatment  capacity, particularly in Europe.\n\nThe  sites  are  responsible  for  equipment  operation  and wastewater  management,  which  are  subject  to  specific procedures and instructions. At least once a year, an internal audit  or  a  self-assessment  of  the  corresponding  facility  is organised and documented.\n\nEach factory has a self-monitoring system representative of the  wastewater  discharged.  It  serves  to  monitor  regulated and contractual parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), pH, the temperature  of  wastewater  and  substances  that  could disrupt  the  operation  of  an  internal  or  external  wastewater management  facility.  This  self-monitoring  is  a  tool  for detecting the risk of overshooting, which helps anticipate any non-conformities and initiate corrective actions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These reductions are related to the operational startups  of  new  effluent  treatment  plants  and  the  optimisation and extension of  existing  treatment  plants  at  several  Group factories.\n\n## Wastewater quality index\n\nAs part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group has established an internal standard for industrial effluent quality leaving the sites. By 2030, 100% of the wastewater leaving the sites must not  exceed  a  COD  of  1,000  mg  COD/l.  If  local  regulations impose a lower threshold, the site must comply with the lower value. At year-end 2023, 22 factories were in compliance with this  internal  standard,  representing  59%  of  the  Group's factories.\n\n(grams of COD per finished product)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scope: production sites                    | 2022                | 2023     |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| Accidental spills  (number of instances)   | 0                   | 0        |\n| Wastewater at the exit of the site  (m 3 ) | 1,020,362 1,060,464 | \u2611        |\n| COD at the exit of the site ( in tonnes )  | 2,218               | 2,467  \u2611 |\n\n## The Group's air emissions, excluding greenhouse gases\n\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, L'Or\u00e9al works continually to control  its  atmospheric  emissions.  Every  month,  the  Group's sites collect data in order to calculate the quantity of sulphur dioxide  (SO2)  emitted  into  the  atmosphere.  These  emissions are  calculated  based  on  fuel  consumption  and  sulphur content.  The  operation  and  maintenance  of  atmospheric emission  collection  and  treatment  facilities  are  subject  to specific procedures and instructions.\n\nThe quantity of SO2 emitted by all the sites operated by the Group totalled 0.14 tonnes in 2022 and 0.10 tonnes in 2023, representing a reduction of 29%.\n\n## Noise pollution\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  industrial  activities  are  not  particularly  noisy.  The sites  comply  with  the  applicable  noise  standards.  Internal environmental  reporting  is  one  way  to  ensure  monthly readings of any non-conformity on this issue.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risks\n\nThe  amount  of  the  provisions  for  environmental  risks  is  not material (see note 13.1 of the Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\n## 4.3.1.1.3. Efforts to fight climate change on operated sites (1)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  a  major  objective  of  fighting  climate change in the overall exercise of its activities. Every effort is being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly at the sites where its activities are performed.\n\nCompared  to  other  industries,  the  cosmetics  industry  has lower  energy  consumptions  and  lower  CO2  emissions.  There are  no  carbon  pricing  mechanisms  (taxes  and  emissions trading  systems)  provided  for  by  international,  national  or regional regulations that apply to L'Or\u00e9al at the end of 2023. This includes all industrial and administrative sites, as well as research  centres.  However,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to the efforts to fight climate change for many years and applies a proactive policy for the reduction of its CO2 emissions.\n\nTo limit its impact on climate change, L'Or\u00e9al has implemented a strategy for reducing the carbon intensity of its sites, which is based around three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing  energy  needs  by  implementing  energy  sobriety approaches  and  by  improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  its facilities (buildings, equipment, industrial processes etc);\n- \u00b7 using local renewable energy; and\n- \u00b7 containing  cooling  gas  leaks  and  using  refrigeration  fluids that have a low impact on global warming.\n\nThis decarbonisation strategy is implemented without the use of carbon offsets.",

These emissions are defined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 emissions: direct GHG emissions from sources controlled or held by the Group. This includes the consumption of gas and  fuel  oil  across  all  operated  sites  (factories,  distribution  centres,  administrative  sites,  research  centres)  and  operated stores.

Indeed, energy consumption was down 17%  from  2019,  and  the  share  of  renewable  energy  rose  to 94% \u2611 (compared with 51% in 2019). The widespread use of remote  working  also  had  a  beneficial  impact  on  this  result, thanks to the reduced presence of teams on site.\n\nComprehensive  Scope 1  &  2  emissions  data,  including  the emissions  of  the  vehicle  fleet  and  operated  stores,  can  be found in subparagraph 4.3.1.4.1.\n\n- SCOPE 1 FOR SITES OPERATED\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reducing energy consumption and withdrawal\n\nFor 20 years, the Group has focused on reducing its energy consumption. These efforts primarily target three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 rolling out energy sobriety initiatives;\n- \u00b7 continuously improving industrial processes and associated equipment;\n- \u00b7 optimising building energy consumption. In this respect, any new  Group  building  has  to  comply  with  the  strictest environmental standards. In particular, they must be LEED Gold certified or equivalent during construction or refurbishment;\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  energy  withdrawal  from  the  grid  and  to speed up the roll out of renewable energy production facilities in the Group's operated sites, a new performance indicator energy withdrawal - has been put in place. This  will  replace the energy consumption reduction indicator from 2023, and it will  become  the  reference  indicator  for  energy  within  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme.  However,  our  sites' performance  in  terms  of  energy  consumption  reduction  will still  be  subject  to  specific  monitoring.  Energy  withdrawal  is calculated by taking the energy consumption and subtracting the energy that is produced and consumed  on-site (self-consumption (1) )  without recourse to off-site resources to produce  this energy (particularly electricity grids, gas networks, biofuels and biomass).\n\nReducing energy withdrawal is based on two drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing  on-site  self-consumption  capacity  by  installing photovoltaic  and  thermal  solar  panels  (on  the  ground, rooftops  or  car  park  canopies)  and  using  geothermal  and heat pump solutions. These facilities use the site's available energy (sunlight, heating and cooling from the ground) and reduce  the  amount  of  resources  extracted  to  serve  its energy requirements;\n- \u00b7 reducing energy consumption in relation to the proportion of energy still taken from off-site resources by implementing energy sobriety and efficiency techniques.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in absolute terms: tonnes of CO 2 equivalent at constant scope, as per the GHG Protocol)\n\n(in absolute terms: tonnes of CO 2 equivalent at constant scope, as per the GHG Protocol)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTARGET 2025: -100%\n\nUnder the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group has set itself the objective of:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing the energy withdrawn by factories and distribution centres per thousand units of finished product by 40% by 2030 compared with 2019;\n- \u00b7 reducing the energy withdrawn by administrative sites and research  centres  per  100  hours  worked  by  40%  by  2030 compared with 2019.\n\nIn  2023,  the  total  energy  withdrawal  of  the  operated  sites was  912,173  megawatt-hours \u2611 .  This  was  a  1%  reduction  in absolute  value  compared  with  2019.

In  2023,  withdrawal  in kilowatt-hours  for  1,000  finished  products  was  111  kilowatthours, down 8% compared with 2019 \u2611 .\n\nIn  2023,  total  energy  withdrawal  at  the  administrative  sites and  research  centres  was  155,601  megawatt-hours \u2611 , a  decrease  of  18%  in  absolute  value  compared  with  2019.

Indeed,  the  on-site  attendance  rate  has  fallen sharply due to the extensive use of remote working. Moreover, industrial  pilot,  laboratory  and  pre-launch  testing  activities (2) , which are more related to research and development projects and  new  product  launches,  consume  a  lot  of  energy regardless  of  the  number  of  employees  present.  A  minimum energy  requirement  is  also  essential  for  the  operation  of buildings and technical facilities.",

The  energy  production  and  distribution markets  vary significantly  from  country  to  country.  This  policy  fosters additionnality, and consists of three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 on-site  production  and  consumption  (self-consumption); then\n- \u00b7 setting up long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with identified sources; and finally\n- \u00b7 purchasing renewable energy from the grid through energy supply contracts (\"green supply\") or buying Energy Attribute Certificates.\n\nThe  supply  of  energy  is  subject  to  specific  requirements  to ensure  compliance  with  best  in  class  market  practices  and standards.  For  example,  for  renewable  electricity,  the electricity-generating  facilities  must  be  located,  as  much  as possible, in the same country and be connected to the same network as the L'Or\u00e9al site, the end consumer.\n\nUnder the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group has set  itself  the  objective  of  100%  renewable  energy (1) for  all operated sites by 2025.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n0\n\n2\n\n80\n\n350\n\n42\n\n0\n\n49\n\n0\n\n560\n\n20\n\n20\n\n296\n\n155\n\n2\n\n02\n\n1\n\n2\n\n02\n\n2\n\nw\n\nEn kilo\n\nw\n\na\n\ntt\n\n-heur\n\ne par 100 heur\n\nes tr\n\nav\n\naill\u00e9es\n\nEn millions de kilo\n\n21\n\na\n\ntt\n\n-heur\n\ne\n\n20\n\n19\n\n2\n\n02\n\n3\n\n1\n\n40\n\n<!-- image -->",

Preserving site water resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Group aspires to preserve water resources throughout its value chain, especially at each of its operational sites.  The  action  plans  implemented  around  the  world  are based notably on the following key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 mapping the volumes of water used , with L'Or\u00e9al's internal Waterscan tool comprehensively analysing the various uses of  water  in  the  Group's  factories. Each  usage  type  is quantified  and  compared  with  a  benchmark  value  to identify potential reduction;\n- \u00b7 installing  equipment  and  processes  for  reduction . This concerns  in  particular  the  cleaning  phase  of  production equipment and packaging lines in factories, and is based on the  OPTImisation  Cleaning  In  Place  (OPTICIP)  approach developed by L'Or\u00e9al; and\n- \u00b7 reusing untreated industrial water for  a  new purpose and recycling  the  water  used,  after  a  specific  additional treatment step.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  15  Group  factories  had  these  recycling facilities and were able to reuse water in industrial processes.\n\nFor  several  years  now,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  using  wastewater treatment  systems  and  water  loops  for  treated  water  in  its factories, as part of its policy to reduce water withdrawal. This recycled water is then used for the site's industrial processes (cooling, heating, cleaning equipment etc.), which means that fresh water consumption can be significantly reduced.\n\nHaving piloted this for several years, L'Or\u00e9al has decided to adopt this as a general practice, therefore strictly limiting the use of mains water or water drawn from the on-site ground water  to  the  volumes  required  to  meet  the  demands  for domestic water and necessary for production only. Sites that exclusively and consistently use reused or recycled water for their industrial processes are known as 'Waterloop factories'. This  means  that  the  water  required  by  the  utilities  (cleaning equipment, steam production etc.) is derived from water that is reused or recycled on the site .\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme has set the following objective:  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  industrial processes  will  be  recycled  and  reused,  i.e.  100%  of  our factories  will  be  Waterloop  factories.  The  objective  of  using 100% recycled or reused water in our industrial processes will be measured using an indicator to be introduced in 2024 that will identify our progress towards this goal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the end of 2023, 5 factories were awarded the status of Waterloop Factory, i.e. 14% \uf052 of the Group's factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \uf052\n\n## The 'Waterloop Factory' concept\n\nThe  Waterloop  factory  concept involves  using  municipal  water  only  for  human  consumption  and  for  producing  the  highquality water used as a raw material for product manufacturing. This means that the water required by the utilities (cleaning equipment, steam production etc.) is derived from water that is reused or recycled on the site .\n\nIt involves a two-step plan of action:\n\n- \u00b7 optimising industrial processes to minimise water use, which reduces water withdrawals; and\n- \u00b7 installing a water recycling system: industrial effluent is pre-treated in the on-site treatment plant. It is then treated using various technologies (ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis etc.) to extract very high-quality water. This water is then  used  in  a  loop  instead  of  mains  water  or  ground  water,  for  cleaning  production  tools  and  for  utilities.  Water requirements for utilities are therefore fully covered.\n\nThe Waterloop factory concept was adopted for the first time in 2017 by the Burgos factory in Spain. In 2023, it was extended to the factories in Settimo (Italy), Vorsino (Russia), Libramont (Belgium) and Yichang (China). It will gradually be rolled out to all  Group  factories  in  an  order  based  on  local  water  stress.  Waterloop status  involves,  as  an  essential  requirement,  an excellent operational control of water distribution, collection and treatment facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Industrial  sites  reached 2,204 thousand m 3 \u2611 in 2023, up 1% compared with 2019, while the production of finished products increased by 12% over the same  period.  Water  withdrawal  for  operated  sites  was 0.37 litres per finished product in 2023 \u2611 ,  a  decrease of 13% from 2019, including 0.32 litres per finished product \u2611 in 2023 for industrial sites (down 10% on 2019).\n\nWATER WITHDRAWAL AT INDUSTRIAL SITES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in litres per finished product)\n\nTotal  water  withdrawal  at  administrative  sites  and  research centres was 318 thousand m 3 in  2023,  down 23% compared with  2019.  Water  withdrawal  was  605  litres  per  100  hours worked  in  2023 \u2611 ,  an  increase  of  6%  compared  with  2019 (- 7% on 2022).\n\nChanges  in  water  withdrawal  intensity  (in  relation  to  the number  of  hours  worked  on  site)  have  been  significantly affected by changes in how work is organised. However, while domestic  consumption  is  proportional  to  the  presence  of employees on site, this is not the case for all water uses. For example,  industrial  pilot,  laboratory  and  pre-launch  testing activities, which are more related to research and development  projects  and  new  product  launches,  consume a lot of water regardless of the number of employees present. In  addition,  a  minimum  amount  of  water  withdrawal  is required to maintain and clean technical facilities.\n\nWATER WITHDRAWAL AT ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in litres per 100 hours worked)\n\n(in litres per finished product)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WATER CONSUMPTION AND QUANTITATIVE WATER FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTION SITES\n\nIn  2021,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  local  dimension  of water-related issues, the Group created a new indicator: the quantitative water footprint. It is calculated based on a site's the water consumption (2) and the level of water stress of the local watershed.\n\nThe  quantitative  water  footprint  is  calculated  solely  for factories,  as  these  account  for  most  (84%  in  2023)  of  the Group's water withdrawal across all sites.\n\nAt the end of 2023, 13 of the Group's 37 factories (35%) were situated in water stressed watersheds.\n\nWATER WITHDRAWAL GROUP-WIDE\n\n<!-- image -->",

This programme encourages companies to annually publish their water management strategy, their results and the projects they have launched to improve water performance and reduce water-related risk. It was launched by CDP, an independent not-for-profit  organisation  that  promotes  environmental  transparency  and  disclosure  on  several  issues,  including  climate change, water and deforestation.\n\nIn 2023, L'Or\u00e9al was recognised for the eighth consecutive year as one of the world leaders for its strategy and actions in sustainable water management . It received the highest possible 'A' rating from CDP. These initiatives cover its entire value chain, from the production of raw materials to products being used by consumers and reaching the end of their life.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also encouraging its supply chain to manage water sustainably (see subparagraph 4.3.1.2.2.).\n\n## 4.3.1.1.5. Protecting biodiversity on operated sites (1)\n\nThe  Group  wishes  to  limit  the  impact  of  its  activity  on biodiversity  throughout  its  value  chain  and  at  each  site  it operates. Biodiversity protection initiatives and awareness-raising activities for employees and local stakeholders  have  been  running  for  several  years  at  many sites.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has rules governing land use when constructing new buildings  (see  subparagraph  4.3.1.1.2.).  In  addition  to  these, since  2018,  each  site  responsible  for  maintaining  green  or non-artificial  spaces  has  been  asked  to  put  in  place  an appropriate  structure  to  roll  out  a  biodiversity  roadmap. Partnerships  with  local  external  organisations  (associations, specialist  firms  etc.)  are  established  to  carry  out  on-site biodiversity inventories and propose appropriate action plans consistent  with  the  ecosystems  within  which  the  sites operate.\n\nThese  inventories  consider  local,  regional  and  national challenges,  and  relate  to  the  proportion  and  connection  of green spaces, the diversity of habitats and vegetation layers, the number of species (flora and fauna), including protected, endangered, and invasive species.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  further  progress,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme aims to ensure that all buildings and industrial sites operated by the Group have a positive impact on biodiversity by 2030 compared to a baseline situation  (established  between  2019 and 2023).\n\nA methodology for monitoring this commitment  was developed  in  2021  and  rolled  out  to  all  of  the  Group's  sites from  2022  onwards.  The  status  \"Biodiversity  Net  Positive Site\" is granted based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  achievement  of  a  target  for  the  improvement  of habitat and  biodiversity quality . At site level, this improvement is measured using an internal indicator called the Site Biodiversity Score (SBS). The information required to  calculate  it  is  taken  from  biodiversity  inventories.  This indicator assesses and monitors the quality of biodiversity on a given site. Sites without the control on green or nonartificial  spaces  must  engage  in  offsite  projects,  whose evolution  in  terms  of  biodiversity  quality  is  integrated  into the calculation of the SBS of the site; and\n- \u00b7 achieving  a  target  for  propagating  a  biodiversity  culture . The development  of  a  biodiversity culture involves educating  and  training  all  teams  at  a  site,  incorporating biodiversity  considerations  into  the  rollout  of  new  projects (extending a building etc.) and into the everyday life of the site  (light  pollution,  phytosanitary  products,  awareness  of food waste etc.).  The  average  culture  score  in  2023  is  1.3 out of 5.\n\nPhytosanitary products (insecticides, fungicides and herbicides) used in the maintenance of green spaces can have adverse  effects  on  the  environment  and  human  health. L'Or\u00e9al is therefore committed to discontinue the use of these products at its operated sites by 2030.\n\nAt the end of 2023, 97 sites had carried out a biodiversity inventory, which is 91% of sites responsible for maintaining their green spaces.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Preserving resources and reducing waste on operated sites\n\nFor  several  years,  there  has  been  an  ambitious  approach to  waste  reduction  and  recovery  in  the  Group  within  the framework  of  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All programme. The L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme is continuing this work. This  is  an  ambitious  challenge  in  light  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  exacting definition  of  waste.  Indeed,  any  substance,  product  or material leaving a site that is not a finished product intended for consumption is considered as waste, regardless of how it is treated.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group has set targets to reduce the waste it generates by 2030:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing the waste generation of factories and distribution centres  by  30%  per  finished  product  compared  to  2019; and\n- \u00b7 reducing  the  waste  generation  of  administrative  sites  and research centres by 30% per 100 hours worked compared to 2019.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continued to work towards its 'zero waste to landfill' objective (unless required by regulation).\n\n## Reducing waste generation at source\n\nThe reduction of waste generation involves the Group's entire value chain , and is enabled in particular by:\n\n- \u00b7 eco-designing products , packaging articles and transportation  packaging  in  a  way  that  aims  to  reduce waste  and  improve  their  recyclability  (weight  reductions, optimisation, reuse etc.);\n- \u00b7 mapping  the  waste  generated using  the WasteScan tool, an in-house L'Or\u00e9al tool that carries out a comprehensive analysis of the different types of waste on site, particularly for  the  Group's  industrial  sites.  Each  type  of  waste  is quantified and compared with a benchmark value in order to identify potential reductions and to prioritise any action to be taken;\n- \u00b7 optimising transportation packaging of raw materials and packaging  components  received  in  the  Group's  factories. The  development  of  the wall-to-wall (1) approach  is  a particularly  effective  means  of  reducing  waste  related  to the supply of components at source;\n\n- \u00b7 a  continuous  improvement  of  manufacturing,  filling  and packing  procedures in order  to  reduce  losses  during production;\n- \u00b7 management  of  obsolete  stock in  order  to  reduce  waste generation.  In  each  zone,  programmes  combine  industrial agility  and  improved  sales  forecasts.  They  aim  to  reduce product obsolescence and improve flows via the establishment  of outlets,  sales  to  employees'  friends  and family,  sales  to  staff  and  donations  to  not-for-profit organisations.\n\nIn its restaurants under direct management, the Group raises employees' awareness of waste, ensures 100% of food waste is  recovered and adapts the quantities served accordingly. It promotes  responsible,  fair  trade  and  sustainable  food  by favouring local organically farmed produce, fair trade coffee, and  seasonal  fruit  and  vegetables.  Campuses  in  the  Paris region  have  committed  to  reducing  plastic  and  recovering frying  oils  by  turning  them  into  biofuel.  Two  campuses  have earned the 'Mon restau responsable' label for a quality food service that respects the environment.\n\n## GENERATION OF TRANSPORTABLE WASTE FROM OPERATED SITES (2)\n\nIn  2023,  93,496  tonnes  of  waste  (excluding  sludge) \u2611 were generated at sites  operated  by  the  Group  (up  1%),  including 88,297 tonnes of waste at industrial sites (excluding sludge) \u2611 an increase of 3% compared to 2019. Over the same period, the  production  of  finished  products  increased  by  12%.  This represents 13.7 grams per finished product \u2611 for all operated sites (10% decrease) including 13.0 grams per finished product for industrial sites \u2611 , an 8% decrease compared with 2019.\n\nWaste  generation  for  the  administrative  sites  and  research centres  was  5,199  tonnes  in  2023  (excluding  sludge) \u2611 , representing a 20%  decrease compared with 2019. This  represents  9.9  kilograms  per  100  hours  worked \u2611 ,  an increase  of  9%  compared  with  2019  (-10%  compared  with 2021).\n\nChanges  in  waste  generation  intensity  (in  relation  to  the number  of  hours  worked  on  site)  have  been  significantly affected by changes  in the way  in which work is organised.  Indeed,  since  the  lockdown  periods,  the  on-site attendance rate has fallen sharply due to the extensive use of remote working.\n\nIndustrial  pilot,  laboratory  and  pre-launch  testing  activities, which are more related to research and development projects and new product launches, generate waste regardless of the number of administrative staff present.",

        "page_content": "Since 2017, L'Or\u00e9al has been working to discontinue sending waste to landfill and has a 'zero waste to landfill' objective for  all  its  sites  by  the  end  of  2030  (unless  required  by regulation). Alongside specialist companies and local authorities, the Group strives to implement the best available processing  solutions.  Sites  may  only  send  waste  to  landfill when required by local regulations or when the nature of the waste generated requires that it is stored in specialist disposal centres.\n\nThe Group's factories and distribution centres rallied together to ensure this objective was achieved for the five consecutive years up to 2022. However, industrial sites did not achieve the 'zero  waste  to  landfill'  objective  in  2023  as  the  waste  from some  of  the  Group's  factories  and  distribution  centres  was sent  to  landfill  (without  regulatory  constraints).  Stricter monitoring  of  regulatory  constraints  has  been  set  up  and action plans have been implemented with the aim of reaching this target as quickly as possible.\n\nResearch  centres  achieved  the  'zero  waste  to  landfill' objective  in  2023.  For  administrative  sites,  the  approach  is more recent, but has accelerated.\n\nThe  achievement  of  this  target  is  part  of  the  more overarching circular economy approach the Group is engaged in.  As  far  as  possible,  L'Or\u00e9al  seeks  to  promote  the  local treatment  of  waste,  in  order  to  reduce  the  environmental impact and to create synergies with other local stakeholders.\n\n## 4.3.1.2. Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation\n\nAbove  and  beyond  its  strict  requirements  for  its  own  sites, L'Or\u00e9al has for a number of years applied an environmental policy  to  its  entire  value  chain. L'Or\u00e9al  works  in  partnership with  its  suppliers  to  improve  the  environmental  profile  of  its products  via  the  eco-design  and  sustainable  sourcing of packaging,  ingredients, formulas  and  their  method  of transportation.  This  worldwide  ecosystem  covers  all  the Group's  needs  for  packaging,  raw  materials,  subcontracting, production  equipment,  promotional  and  advertising  articles etc. The commitment and performance of this ecosystem are crucial to achieve the Group's objectives.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al runs numerous global events (Spread the green vibes). These enable the Group to share its sustainability ambitions, introduce  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  to  a  wider  audience  and disseminate  its  action  plans.  In  2023,  more  than  2,000 suppliers  were  invited  to  attend  18  of  such  events  across  all Zones.\n\nIn  2023,  to  help  progress  its  objective  to  reduce  its  carbon intensity,  the  Group  set  up  a  platform  for  sharing  good practices  ( Spread  the  Best  Practices ), which  highlights solutions, impacts and key factors to success.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## 4.3.1.2.1. Due diligence: selecting and assessing strategic suppliers\n\n## A/ Assessing suppliers according to their environmental and social performance\n\nThe Group has decided to use the environmental and social performance  of  its  partners  and  suppliers  as  a  primary selection  and  evaluation  criterion.  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitments under  its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  are  in  line with  the  Group's  responsible  purchasing  policy  initiated  in 2002 with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care programme.\n\nIn 2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  published  a  new  sustainable  sourcing strategy focused on four pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 the protection of human rights;\n- \u00b7 the preservation of the environment and resources;\n- \u00b7 the integrity of business relationships; and\n- \u00b7 diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThis strategy includes commitments, objectives and monitoring tools for each pillar. The values and standards are shared with suppliers. Meanwhile the objectives are based on collaboration with external experts using recognised benchmarks. This common framework integrates these stakes into  the  heart  of  the  business  model  in  order  to  achieve sustainable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Purchasing teams have defined five standard performance  criteria  to  assess  and  select  suppliers:  quality, social  and  environmental  responsibility,  innovation,  supply chain and services, and competitiveness.\n\nThese  standards represent  the  basis  for  daily  performance and  long-term  strategies .  A  global  scorecard  is  used  for  all purchasing  domains.  It  makes  it  possible to  accurately measure supplier  results,  in  particular  their  corporate  social responsibility commitments , which represent 20% of the final assessment of suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  are  also discussed during strategic meetings (1) . The evaluation of  suppliers  on  the  CSR  standard  is  based,  in  particular,  on their  social  audit  compliance,  the  implementation  of  the Inclusive  Sourcing programme,  their  results  in  the  'CDP Supply Chain' programmes for the reduction of CO2 emissions and their EcoVadis assessment.\n\nThe  suppliers  evaluated  represent  more  than  83%  of  total direct purchases (2) and 21% of indirect purchases (3) .\n\nSuppliers can train by self-study via a website made available to them by the Group. These learning courses aim to optimise their  sustainability  policies.  Videos,  articles  and  presentations are available, covering a variety of topics, such as decarbonisation, the living wage, social audits etc. This content is currently available to all the Group's strategic suppliers.\n\n## B/ Social audits: a rigorous and continuous improvement process\n\nSince 2002, the Group's suppliers have had to sign the Mutual Ethical Commitment Letter. This document, reviewed in 2021, sets  out  the  requirements  and  commitments  that  L'Or\u00e9al imposes on its suppliers according to the Group's programmes and  policies concerning  ethics, corporate  responsibility, human  rights,  working  conditions  and  compliance.  The 'Mutual  Ethical  Commitment  Letter'  has  been  rolled  out gradually to all suppliers worldwide (see section 3.4).\n\nThe  Group's  subcontractors  and  its  suppliers  of  raw materials, packaging,  production  equipment  and  POS/ promotional  advertising  items  located  in  countries  identified as being at risk according to Verisk Maplecroft are subject to a mandatory  social  audit (and  prior  to  any  inclusion  on  the supplier  panel).  These  audits,  performed  by  independent service providers, aim in particular to:\n\n- \u00b7 verify  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  human  rights and labour law; and\n- \u00b7 cover  employee  safety,  working  conditions  and  the  impact  of activities on the environment.\n\n## Key figures\n\nSince 2020, 3,212 supplier sites have been audited according to the L'Or\u00e9al standard (see paragraph 3.4.7.3):\n\n- \u00b7 1,242 audits (4) were carried out in 2023 \u2611 , which means 4,891 have been carried out since 2020; and\n- \u00b7 Follow-up audits represent 36% of the total number of audits conducted in 2023 and allowed 67% of the suppliers audited to improve their results.\n\n## C/ Encouraging strategic suppliers to conduct a self-assessment of their sustainability policy\n\nIn 2014, L'Or\u00e9al launched a programme for assessing strategic suppliers (5) and  their sustainability policy. The  EcoVadis assessment  is  helping  to  refine  the  analysis  of  suppliers' performance  and  identify  areas  for  improvement  in  terms  of human  rights  protection, business ethics, environmental preservation and diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n## 2023 Results\n\nIn  2023,  965  suppliers  were  subjected  to  an  EcoVadis assessment of their social, environmental and ethical policies, as  well  as  the  implementation  of  those  policies  by  their  own suppliers.  301  of  them,  representing  95%  of  the  Group's strategic suppliers (6) , obtained an average score of 63/100.\n\nThe Group finances the initial audits as well as the re-audits that  take  place  three  years  later.  The  follow-up  audits  to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions are paid for by the suppliers.\n\nTen  areas  are  audited:  child  labour;  forced  labour;  the environment,  health  and  safety;  compliance  with  the  laws relating to trade  unions;  non-discrimination;  disciplinary practices; harassment  or  a  hostile  work  environment; due  payment  of  remuneration  and  benefits;  working  time; and relations with subcontractors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  social  audit  is  mainly  based  on  the  internationally recognised SA 8000 standard. However, the Group has also imposed  more  stringent  criteria,  particularly  in  terms  of  the minimum age for employment. This is set at 16 years of age for  all  employees  of  suppliers,  a  higher  age  limit  than  that required  by  the  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  for non-hazardous work.\n\nA  tool  for  social  audits  is  used  to  plan  the  audits  with  the external service provider's system and to manage the results and action plans for all suppliers concerned. An online learning programme  that supplements the Sourcing Discovery learning  module  is  available  to  all  purchasers.  This  explains to  every  new  purchaser  the  importance  of  the  social  audit programme and how purchasers  must  make  it  part  of  their daily  process.  The  Group's  purchasers  accordingly  promote the continuous improvement of their suppliers in line with the Group's standards.",

Involving strategic suppliers in the Group's ambitions\n\n## A/ Encouraging suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  involved  its  suppliers  in  the  process of  measuring  and  reducing  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions by  encouraging  them  to  participate  in  CDP Supply  Chain programme.  In  2023,  790  suppliers  participated  in  CDP Supply Chain, representing 85% of the 926 suppliers invited. These  suppliers,  which  are  large  industrial  groups  and  small and  medium  businesses,  were  selected  from  all  purchasing areas,  everywhere  in  the  world.  The  average  result  for strategic suppliers in 2023 was 'B-'.\n\nIn the direct purchases category, the suppliers participating in CDP Supply Chain account for 90% of expenditure in 2023. The average result for the direct suppliers was 'B-'.\n\nIn December 2015 at the time of COP21, L'Or\u00e9al strengthened its  objectives  and  accelerated  the  implementation  of  its efforts  to  fight  climate  change.  Since  then,  suppliers  have been  encouraged,  via  CDP  Supply Chain,  to  report  their carbon  emissions,  set  targets  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions and communicate their action plans to achieve this.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  suppliers  meeting  this  commitment represented  87%  of  the  Group's  strategic  suppliers.  The average score of these suppliers is 'B', the highest score since the start of the programme.\n\nCDP  continues  to  recognise  L'Or\u00e9al  as  a  company  that  is committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  2023, CDP awarded L'Or\u00e9al as 'Supplier Engagement Leader' (1) for the 6th consecutive year, among more than 450 companies, for encouraging all players in its supply chain to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nIn 2023, the teams worked with CDP to support the suppliers and undertook the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 organised  meetings  and  learning  sessions  on  climate change;\n- \u00b7 led online conferences for suppliers entering the programme;\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n- \u00b7 sent out feedback forms with their results summarising the achievements  and  the  areas  for  improvement  to  be addressed;\n- \u00b7 offered strategic suppliers individual support to help them understand  the  challenges  of  climate  change  and  to improve their reports in terms of environmental issues; and\n- \u00b7 continued  to  develop  online  toolboxes  to  improve  supplier understanding of these issues.\n\nCDP  Supply Chain  assessment  is  at  the  heart  of  the discussions  during  annual  strategic  meetings,  but  also throughout  the  year,  in  the  context  of  our  interactions  with suppliers.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group is committed  to  supporting  its  strategic  suppliers  in  reducing their  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  50%  between  2016  and 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2). The Group has defined a methodology to  mobilise  suppliers  based  on  their  emissions  contributions and  to work with them  to  manage  their  emissions performance.\n\nThis methodology is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 their commitment to CDP Supply Chain;\n- \u00b7 their emissions contributions;\n- \u00b7 the  reliability  of  their  reported  data,  which  is  checked  by monitoring the verification conducted by a third party;\n- \u00b7 the  adoption  of  ambitious  targets  and  the  launch  of associated action plans; and\n- \u00b7 the  alignment  of  their  trajectory  with  the  Science  Based Targets initiative.\n\nThe commitments set by each supplier form the foundation of the global suppliers emissions reduction trajectory.\n\nIn 2023, 44% of strategic suppliers had an objective that was validated by the SBTi.\n\nIn cooperation with suppliers , an action plan is drawn up and monitored, utilising the decarbonisation drivers that are suited to their business, their circumstances and their maturity.\n\nThe  Group  urges  its  suppliers  to  have  their  emissions  data checked  by  a  third  party  to  improve  the  reliability  of  their trajectories.  In  2023,  73%  of  the  Group's  strategic  suppliers had their carbon data checked by a third party as required by CDP.\n\n## Involving suppliers in CDP Forests programme\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is working towards Zero Deforestation (palm and derivatives, soy, paper and cardboard). In this regard, L'Or\u00e9al has participated in CDP Forests since 2012.\n\nSince 2017, L'Or\u00e9al has encouraged its 218 main suppliers of paper, palm oil and soy to participate in CDP Supply Chain via its CDP Forests programme dedicated to the supply chain. At the end of 2023, 159 of the selected suppliers had participated in the  programme's  seventh  year.  Suppliers  that  created  reports  and  implemented  a  Zero  Deforestation  policy  and  related initiatives represented 34% of selected suppliers' expenditures. Their average score was 'B'.\n\n## B/ Encouraging suppliers to use water responsibly\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group is committed  to  supporting  its  strategic  suppliers  in  managing their  water  sustainably.  This  support  is  based  on  a  twofold approach:  each  supplier  must  have  a  sustainable  water management  plan.  The  supplier  must  also  consider  the condition of the water stress zone in which it operates and its industrial water consumption and wastewater treatment.\n\nTo progress this further, the Group organised several expert consultations in 2023. The aim is to look at the best practices to be adopted in terms of sustainable water management and the most relevant indicators to use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, L'Or\u00e9al selected 348 suppliers based on three criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 technology or activity consuming particularly large amounts of water;\n- \u00b7 location of at least one production site in a high water stress area; and\n- \u00b7 the size of L'Or\u00e9al's purchase volumes.\n\n265  of  them  agreed  to  take  part  in  the  programme  and  Group  experts  gave  them  individual  results  summarising  the opportunities they acted on and the areas for improvement to be addressed. L'Or\u00e9al encourages its suppliers to measure, report and set water consumption reduction targets for each production site by deploying a water-related risk assessment and management system.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  suppliers  fulfilling  this  commitment  to  CDP  Water  security represented  49%  of  selected  suppliers' expenses. Their average score was 'B'.\n\n## C/ Using the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion\n\nThe objectives of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future express the conviction that reducing the environmental footprint of products has to be  accompanied  by  an improvement  in  their  social  and societal benefit.\n\nThanks  to  its  many  industrial  and  administrative  sites worldwide, L'Or\u00e9al is strongly involved in the life of the local communities.  As  a  company  committed  to  demonstrating strong  corporate  citizenship,  L'Or\u00e9al  builds good  relations with  the  local  communities  and  strives  to  share  its  growth with them.\n\nThe Group joins forces with its suppliers to develop its positive impact programmes and promote a more inclusive society. By 2030, Inclusive Sourcing will have helped to achieve L'Or\u00e9al's goal  of  enabling  100,000  additional  people  who  are  socially or economically vulnerable to access employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunched  in  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al's global Inclusive Sourcing programme (1) harnesses  the  Group's  purchasing  power  to promote  social  inclusion.  L'Or\u00e9al  allocates  part  of  its  total purchasing volume to suppliers that provide employment and a  sustainable  income  to  people  who  are  generally  excluded from  the  labour  market.  In  all  regions  of  the  world  in  which L'Or\u00e9al is present, the programme supports:\n\n- \u00b7 companies that employ people from economically vulnerable  communities .  These  communities  are  identified with  reference  to  the  Group's  DE&I  policy:  for  example, people with a disability, senior citizens, refugees etc. Local authority guidelines are also considered where relevant (2) as well  as  international  standards  such  as Women-Owned Businesses as defined by the WeConnect guidelines; and\n- \u00b7 companies that struggle to access major international calls for tenders .\n\nBy applying fair trade principles in their sourcing strategy, the Group's  Raw  Materials  Purchasing  teams  enable  a  positive social  impact  while  integrating  the  challenges  of  responsible agricultural practices, environmental protection and biodiversity.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  leads  fair  and  sustainable  procurement  projects  in Morocco, for products such as olive oil and botanicals such as saffron  and  pomegranate  that  are  grown  in  community gardens  in  Ourika.  These  programmes  mean  the  Group  can obtain essential ingredients while delivering a positive impact on nature and the neighbouring communities.\n\nThrough  its Inclusive  Sourcing programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has commitments it shares with its suppliers that relate to the four pillars of the Group's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy:\n\n## Socio-economic and multicultural diversity:\n\n- \u00b7 Social impact is central to discussions between the Group's purchasers  and  their  suppliers.  In  each  country,  they identify  communities  that  are  economically  and  socially disadvantaged  and  undertake  to  give  them  access  to employment (3) .\n- \u00b7 Helping  refugees  find  work  is  a  commitment  the  Group shares with its suppliers. In Poland, for example, more than 50  Ukrainian  refugees  work  full-time  as  employees  of  a major  supplier  in  this  area,  producing  POS  advertising materials.\n- \u00b7 New technologies constitute a strong driver of inclusion. In France,  L'Or\u00e9al  works  with  an  inclusive  company  on  its strategic  transformation  projects.  Long-term  jobseekers carry  out  tests  and  provide  IT  support,  and  develop  key skills for their future employability.",

L'Or\u00e9al is joining forces with its  partners  to  deliver  on  this.  In  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities supported  more  than  3,200  full-time  jobs  for  people employed by its suppliers, in 36 countries.\n\n## Age and Generations:\n\n- \u00b7 In  34  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  access  to  employment for 2,139 people over 50 years of age through its purchases of  packaging  production,  POS  items,  promotional  items and services.\n\n## Gender and LGBTQIA+ (1) :\n\n- \u00b7 In  38  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al  supports  projects  related  to  the empowerment of women, which represent 42,571 jobs.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  developing  a  solidarity  sourcing  project for shea in Burkina Faso since 2014. 25,160 women working together  in  producer  groups  are  paid  a  fair  price guaranteed  by  the Fair  For  Life  label.  A  unique  and innovative  microinsurance  project  has  been  launched  by L'Or\u00e9al  and  its  partners,  which  improves  the  economic resilience of female producers.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al is committed to the living wage (2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA living wage must cover an individual's basic needs - such as housing, meals, health and education - as well as  those  of  any  of  their  dependents.  At  L'Or\u00e9al,  a  remuneration  monitoring  process  is  in  place  to  adjust, if  necessary,  the  remuneration  paid  to  the  Group's  permanent  employees  to  ensure  they  receive  a  living wage. L'Or\u00e9al has been accredited to the Fair Wage Network, a rigorous independent organisation, since 2023.\n\nIn line with its commitment to fair pay for all of its employees, L'Or\u00e9al aims to ensure that, by 2030, all its strategic suppliers' employees will be paid at least a living wage.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al launched a pilot programme that included some 20 of its strategic suppliers. The programme's objective was to explore the principle of the living wage and to provide support for its suppliers. This pilot project used to test the effectiveness of the supplier support system based on cohort principles.\n\nA  series  of  meetings  were  organised  with  a  group  of  suppliers,  the  Fair  Wage  Network  and  L'Or\u00e9al  in  attendance.  The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the strategy and methodology, as well as to hear from the suppliers that were furthest  forward  in  the  process.  This  way,  companies  were  encouraged  to  share  best  practices  and  any  difficulties  they encountered. Following this series of meetings, suppliers are invited to make commitments through a living wage pledge. In 2023, more than 115 suppliers benefitted from individual support and more than 50 suppliers pledged to be compliant by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, L'Or\u00e9al provides a digital platform named Spread The Best Practices. This media tool makes it possible to stream learning materials on implementing a fair wage policy.\n\nIn  addition,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  working  hard  to  create  fair  wage  synergies  so  as  to  encourage  other  stakeholders  outside  its  own value chain to adopt this commitment.\n\nIn this sense, the Group works closely and advocates alongside public and private businesses and organisations sectors, such as the Better Business through Better Wages initiative, to raise standards in terms of remuneration.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a member of the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition which, in partnership with the OECD, works to incorporate the fair wage into public debate.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n- \u00b7 In China, L'Or\u00e9al supports 53 companies owned and run by women, which employ 1,938 people in total.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al confirms its support for the LGBTQIA+ (4) community. Particularly in the United States, where it works with five suppliers certified as LGBT-Owned Businesses by the independent  body  NGLCC,  the  National  LGBT Chamber of Commerce. In 2023, L'Or\u00e9al was awarded the GEEIS-SDG  trophy  for  its  commitment  and  for  the TransForma project, in particular. L'Or\u00e9al Brazil and its new consumer  engagement  service  provider  help  individuals  in Brazil  who  are  facing  heavy  discrimination  in  the  country gain access to employment.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al USA has partnered with Creator Deck, an agency certified  by  the  Women's  Business  Enterprise  National Council  (WBENC).  This  partnership  illustrates  the  unique value that diversity-focused companies bring to the Group and  how  they  are  fostering  innovation.  Its  diversified database of influencers and its social media content enable brands  such  as  Maybelline  and  NYX  to  promote  a  daring and inclusive vision of beauty.\n- \u00b7 In India, several of the Group's major partners in the field of new technologies have developed programmes to promote the  employment  of  women.  The  aim  is  to  increase  the proportion of women in IT activities/services and to enable them to develop their careers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reducing the environmental impact associated with transporting L'Or\u00e9al products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  reducing  the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the transportation of its products (1) .  The Sharing Beauty With All programme initiated the reduction of GHG emissions by 24% per unit sold per kilometre between 2011 and 2020.\n\nAs part of its new commitments, L'Or\u00e9al is going further and has set itself a target of reducing GHG emissions by 50% per finished product by 2030, in comparison to 2016. The scope of consolidation  covers  the  transportation  flows  of  finished products  from  the  production  sites  to  the  first  customer delivery  point.  The  commitments  have  been  shared  with  the entire  internal  and  external  ecosystem.  As  such,  sustainable transportation was ranked as a priority and one of the major strategic components of the Group's sustainability transformation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  sustainable  transport  strategy  is  based  on  five pillars. It focuses in particular on the two greatest contributors to GHG emissions associated with product transportation: air and road transport.\n\nThe five pillars of the sustainable transport strategy include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Limit air travel and provide for specific monitoring\n\nThe  reduction  of  air  transport  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the distribution  strategy.  As  such,  it  is  included  in  the  Divisions' budget  targets  and  is  integrated  into  our  purchasing strategies, for example by favouring local production.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  transported  0.2%  of  its  products  by weight by air,  representing  19%  of  its  transportation-related carbon footprint. As a result, the total carbon footprint of air transport in 2023 was reduced by 44% compared to 2022.\n\nThese  results reflect a continuous  decrease  for  four consecutive years.\n\nThis is illustrated by the exemplary work of our Luxe Division, which organised for some promotional kits to be manufactured two months early, enabling it to reduce the use of air travel by 95% for worldwide shipments from France.\n\n## 2. The Greener Lanes prgramme dedicated to long-distance road transport\n\nThis  programme  implements  solutions  that  will  reduce  CO2 emissions  on  long-distance  road  flows  with  the  highest emissions.  In  2023,  transportation  of  finished  products  by road represented 67.6% of the Group's GHG emissions for the transport of finished products.\n\nTo  cut  these  emissions,  new  solutions  are  being  rolled  out gradually  for  all  flows  between  the  Group's  factories, distribution centres and customers:\n\n- \u00b7 the  use  of  multimodal  transport,  for  example  river  or  rail freight, rather than road;\n- \u00b7 the use of energy with a lower environmental impact, such as biogas or biofuel vehicles, to replace diesel.\n\nFor  example,  for  the  first  time  in  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  ran  regular, express  freight  trains  between  Europe  and  Asia,  which reduced its use of air transport to this destination.\n\n## 3. The Greener  Last  Mile (GLAM)  programme  designed  to implement solutions that will reduce CO2 emissions from urban transport\n\nThe  Group  is  also  specifically  addressing  the  environmental impact  of  urban  transport.  It  aims  to  deploy  lower-impact solutions, such as electric vehicles, cargo bikes or natural gas vehicles.\n\n## 4. Performance  management,  an  important  aspect  of  the Group's strategy\n\nFor several years, the Group has committed to a sustainable decarbonisation  policy  and  applied  robust  action  plans  that are specific to each country.\n\nDigitalisation,  a  strategic  driver,  facilitates  access  to  data. B analysing the precise data associated with the upstream and downstream  transport  from  the  distribution  centres  of  the Group's subsidiaries, the sourcing and transport teams are able to prioritise their actions according to their impact.\n\nThis regular monitoring of action plans and performance for the different modes of transportation are crucial. It provides the  Group's  stakeholders  with  the  visibility  they  need  to implement the Group's carbon footprint reduction strategy.\n\nThe Transport  Management  Systems  (TMS),  which  are operational  in  a  number  of  countries,  provide  access  to transport  operational  data  for  consolidating  and  analysing performance in a pertinent manner.\n\n## 5. Working  in  partnership  with  the  stakeholders  in  its ecosystem: a key driver  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint reduction roadmap\n\nThe Group selects and assesses its suppliers and transportation  partners  based  on  an  alignment  with  their environmental and social policy. It also considers the actions they  take  to  support  the  Group  in  its  efforts  to  reduce  its carbon footprint.\n\nThe ability of these partners to create innovative sustainable solutions, such as green energies (biogas, biofuel, electricity or hydrogen)  or  alternative  modes  of  transport  (cargo  bikes, train),  is  an  essential  selection  criterion.  The  Group  also conducts  regular  monitoring  to  identify  new  opportunities. Alongside  its  partners,  the  Group  also  organises  workshops focused on decarbonising transport.",

This is a 15.4% decrease in  intensity  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  (gCO2/unit  sold) over  the  same  period.  In  2023,  CO2  emissions  linked  to  air transport fell by 44% compared to 2022 (1) .  In  return,  the  use and  carbon  footprint  of  lower-carbon  (maritime  and  rail) transport modes increased by 4.25%.\n\n## 4.3.1.3. Sustainability: from use to consumption\n\nThe  Group  is  pursuing  its  commitments  to  strike  the  best possible  balance  between  fulfilling  its  own  needs  and preserving a planet with limited resources.The objectives set out in L'Or\u00e9al for the Future were defined with this in mind.\n\nFor  the  Group,  preserving  resources  is  a  long-standing commitment. It applies to the entire life cycle of our products, from  their  creation  to  their  use  by  consumers.  Whenever a product is designed, created or updated, its environmental profile must be improved.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  activates  a  range  of  drivers  to  promote  sustainable innovation:  reducing  the  environmental  footprint  of  its formulas  and  packaging;  respecting  biodiversity  through a  sustainable  and  responsible  raw  materials  sourcing  policy; and a 'Zero Deforestation' commitment.\n\nTogether with the Management  Committees  of the international brands, the packaging and development teams, the  CSR  team  and  the  laboratories  analyse  their  portfolios of formulas and their packaging. Sustainable innovation plans are defined along with their drivers for each product category.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe  Group  has  decided  to  adopt  an  approach  based  on recent  developments  in  life  and  environmental  sciences. L'Or\u00e9al  launched  its Green  Sciences programme  to  drive sustainable innovation by developing raw materials based on crops  and  practices  that  are  better  for  the  soil,  water  and biodiversity, as well as on Green Extraction, Green Extraction and physical processes, and Green Chemistry.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Research & Innovation strategy in the field of Green Sciences  aims  to  establish  numerous  strategic  partnerships with  innovative  start-ups  in  the  biotech  industry,  both  in France  and  worldwide.  As  such,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  accelerating  its transition to Green Sciences and launching its first dedicated incubator,  co-built  with  the  Genopole  bio-cluster,  which  will accommodate it  at  its  Evry  campus  (in  Essonne,  France).  In this  context,  Interstellar  Lab,  the  French-American  biotech start-up  known  for  its  revolutionary  organic  cultivation platform,  is  committed  to  an  innovative  partnership  with L'Or\u00e9al's  ' Green  Sciences  Incubator '. The  aim  of  this ambitious collaboration is to explore the opportunities offered by  a  self-sufficient  integrated  agricultural  system  controlled by artificial intelligence to source various molecules and active ingredients for use in the cosmetics industry.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has also partnered with Bakar Labs, the University of California  (UC)  Berkeley's  pioneer  biotechnology  incubator. This collaboration offers new perspectives to start-ups in the Bakar  Labs  incubator,  by  giving  them  cost-free  access  to L'Or\u00e9al's  3D-reconstructed  skin  models.  This  partnership means  the  next  generation  of  beauty  products  can  be developed based on both the combined expertise of L'Or\u00e9al and  Bakar  Labs,  and  innovative  biological  technologies. This cooperation follows numerous strategic scientific partnerships  that  L'Or\u00e9al  has  formed  in  recent  months  to strengthen its pioneering Green Sciences for Beauty ecosystem.\n\nAn exclusive, industry-first partnership with Cosmo International  Fragrances  has  been  launched.  The  aim  is  to develop  a  Green  Sciences-based  extraction  process  to revolutionise the art of fine fragrance creation. Developed by Cosmo  International Fragrances  and  made  exclusively available  to  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  patent-pending  technology  is  a waterless,  low-energy,  slow  extraction  process  that  reveals the exact smell of an ingredient while preserving its integrity. This breakthrough Green Sciences process opens the door to new  fragrance  frontiers,  enlarging  the  fragrance-maker's olfactory palette to include 100% natural and pure extracts.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  also  invests  in  a  venture  led  by  biotech  company Genomatica to create sustainable alternatives to petrochemical-based  surfactants.  L'Or\u00e9al  will  be  a  founding member  of  the  venture  alongside  Unilever  and  Kao.  The investment  was  made  through  L'Or\u00e9al's  corporate  venture fund Business Opportunities for L'Or\u00e9al Development (BOLD).\n\nThis proactive  policy  is central to achieving  L'Or\u00e9al's objectives  for  2030  under  its  sustainability  programme,  in particular, ensuring that 95% of its ingredients are bio-based or derived from abundant minerals or circular processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through this initiative, the Group has developed  expertise  regarding  the  potential  impacts  of  its cosmetic  products  on  aquatic  environments.  Right  from  the design  stage,  raw  materials  used  in  the  formulation  of products are evaluated as part of a strict ingredient selection process.  Since  2005,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  stopped  introducing  to  its catalog  new  raw  materials  with  an  adverse  environmental profile (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.1 B and C).\n\nPackaging represents a significant share of the environmental impact  of  cosmetic  products.  Reducing  its  environmental footprint  is  therefore  naturally  in  line  with  the  commitments made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. In 2007, L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a Packaging  and  Environment  Policy  that incorporates  respect  for  consumers,  the  environment  and biodiversity.\n\nThe  new  programme  highlights  three  major  challenges  to improving  the  environmental  profile  of  packaging:  resource optimisation, choice of materials and circularity after product use (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.1. C).\n\n## Measuring the environmental impact of products\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  analysed  the life  cycles  of  its products in  order  to  identify,  evaluate  and  improve  their environmental impact.\n\nSince  2017,  SPOT (1) , a  tool  based  on  a  rigorous  scientific methodology for assessing environmental impacts (2) , has been rolled out to all Group brands (except recent acquisitions). This tool  calculates  the  environmental  footprint  of  a  product according  to  European  Commission  recommendations (3) .  At L'Or\u00e9al, SPOT is an integral part of product launch processes, putting  sustainable  innovation  at  the  very  heart  of  product development.\n\n- 1. SPOT  precisely  measures  environmental  impacts  by integrating  the  14  impact  factors  used  by  the  European product environmental footprint framework.\n- 2. These different impacts are standardised on the basis of average consumer impacts worldwide.\n- 3. To  obtain  a  single  value  for  the  product  environmental footprint  (formula  and  packaging),  these  impacts  are aggregated  using  a  method  based  on  the  planetary boundaries (4) .\n- 4. Lastly, the score obtained, comprised between 0 and 10, is compared to a reference to allow  product  design  teams to measure their progress.\n\nIn  2023, L'Or\u00e9al was awarded Cradle to Cradle certification for 557 products on the US market, including 20 new launches in 2023.\n\n| Brand examples      | Product type   | Certification   |   Number of products |\n|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| L'OR\u00c9AL Paris       | Hair care      | Silver          |                   91 |\n| Maybelline New York | Makeup         | Gold/Silver     |                   39 |\n| Redken              | Hair care      | Silver          |                  156 |\n| YSL                 | Skin care      | Silver          |                   26 |\n\n## B/ Reducing the environmental footprint of formulas\n\nAll  products  manufactured by the Group are analysed, from shampoos  and  haircare  products  to  skincare  products  and perfumes.  This  analysis  enables  products  with  the  same consumer  benefit  to  be  classified according to their environmental footprint.\n\nApproximately  125  product  categories  that  provide  a consumer  benefit  were  defined  and  over  40,000  formulas were screened. Then, the performance of each category was established to allow products to have a better environmental footprint using SPOT. The aim is to develop new formulas to obtain  an  improved  environmental  profile  while  maintaining the same consumer benefits.\n\n## Improving biodegradability\n\nThe  Group  is  working  to  measure  and  increase  the biodegradability  of  its  formulas  and  reduce  their  water footprint at the end of their life cycle. These two parameters are integrated in the SPOT tool.\n\nAll  the  product  formulator  teams  use  this  tool  to  assess biodegradability and water footprint whenever new formulas are created.\n\nIn  2023, 100% of the new formula launches were evaluated, with 79% showing an improved environmental profile.\n\nThe  table  below  lists  some  examples  of  formulas  with biodegradability levels of 98% (all L'Or\u00e9al geographic zones) amongst the products launched in 2023:",

For  example,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  improved  the  formula  for  its EverPure Volume Conditioner ,  increasing its biodegradability level from 73% to over 98%. Garnier updated its Fructis Nutri Curls  cream  formula  and  increased  its  biodegradability  level from 76% to over 98%.\n\nThe biodegradability of the raw materials portfolio was 82% in 2023.\n\n## Reducing the impact of the use phase\n\nInnovation  reduces  the  impact  of  the  consumer  use  phase. The  main  environmental  impacts  in  the  rinse-off  cosmetics sector  arise  when  the  products  are  used.  These  are  the carbon and water footprints.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  preserve  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water resources. As part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group wants to  develop  innovative  solutions  that  enable  consumers  to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption associated with using its products.\n\n## The  three  pillars  of  the  Group's  strategy  to  meet  the challenge of water consumption:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction  in  the  amount  of  water  used  for  rinse-off products: this  means  developing  formulations  that  offer better rinsability. The sales of Garnier continued its sales of solid shampoos, which offer a 20% saving in rinsability.\n- \u00b7 Innovation in beauty routines : the Group continually adapts its innovation model to meet all beauty aspirations around the  world.  L'Or\u00e9al  aims  to  help  consumers  reduce  the impact  of  their  use  phase  by  offering  appropriate innovations.  The  goal  is  to  reduce  the  impact  of  the  use phase,  for  example  by  eliminating  the  rinse  phase.  In Europe, in 2023, Garnier launched no-rinse conditioners as well as Garnier Skinactive Micellar Solution, a no-rinse skin cleanser and makeup remover.\n- \u00b7 Deployment  of  technologies: the  Group  is  developing equipment  to  reduce  water  consumption  in  salons.  It  is collaborating with its  ecosystem to develop new solutions. Since 2021, the Group has also partnered (1) with Swiss startup  Gjosa  to  optimise  rinse-off  technology  for  shampoos, haircare products and hair dyes. Known as L'Or\u00e9al Water Saver,  this  sustainable  technology  for  hair  care  in  salons decreases  water  flow  by  69%.  This  technology  has  been\n\ngradually  rolled  out  since  January  2023 (2) . The  system, totalling  more  than  11,100  units,  has  been  installed  in 5,000  salons.The  website (3) gives  a  real-time  tally  of  the volume of water saved by the units currently installed.\n\nSince  2016,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  have  been  favourably decorrelated  from  the  water  consumption  linked  to  product use. The result of the indicator for water consumption linked to product use in 2023 is explained by the increase in demand and sales of certain types of products, such as cleansers. The Group  is  continuing  its  efforts  on  the  three  pillars  of  its strategy to reach the target set for 2030.\n\nWATER CONSUMPTION LINKED TO PRODUCT USE (4)\n\n(water consumption per litres/kg of formulas sold)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTARGET 2030: -25%\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \uf052\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LINKED TO PRODUCT USE (4)\n\n(tCO 2 eq/kg of formulas sold)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTARGET 2030: -25%\n\n<!-- image -->",

This protocol aims to regulate access to the genetic resources of a given  region  and  ensure  the  fair  and  equitable  sharing  of benefits arising from the use of those resources.\n\nConscious  of  these  issues  well  before  the  Nagoya  Protocol came into force, since 2005 L'Or\u00e9al's Research Department has  adopted  an  approach  aimed  at  securing  its  supply channels  for  the  future.  This  approach  must  address  the issues  to  respect  biodiversity.  To  do  so,  the  Group  gives preference to, among other things, renewable raw materials (1) while ensuring that they are sustainably sourced.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Green Chemistry has been a catalyst for L'Or\u00e9al's  sustainable  innovation  policy.  L'Or\u00e9al  has adopted its  principles  to  promote  the  use  of  renewable  raw materials,  designed  with  waste  reduction  in  mind  and preserving the water cycle. In a broad sense, Green Chemistry aims to prevent upstream pollution and combat the use and contamination of the environment at the source. The growing use  of  plant-based  ingredients  poses  supply  risks  due  to climate  change  (availability  and  price)  and  can  also  have environmental consequences through the cultivation of crops that  produce  these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion, impacts  on  biodiversity  etc.).  Measures  should  therefore  be taken to ensure the long-term sustainability of supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, among the raw materials newly referenced by the Group 63% in number were renewable and 25% in number respected green chemistry.\n\n## PRODUCTS MARKETED IN 2023 WITH A PROPORTION OF RENEWABLE RAW MATERIALS ABOVE 98%\n\n| Product examples                              | Product type      | Brand              | Design zone   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Garnier Fructis Adios Esponjado Treatment     | Haircare          | Garnier            | Brazil        |\n| Baby body oil                                 | Body moisturiser  | Nice and lovely    | Kenya         |\n| Dark & Lovely Pro-Renew Revitalising Hair Oil | Leave-in haircare | Softsheen-Carson   | South Africa  |\n| Barrier Bestie Ultra Whip Cream               | Moisturiser       | Thayers            | USA           |\n| YSL - Or Rouge                                | Facial cleanser   | Yves Saint Laurent | France        |\n\nIn  2023,  in  addition  to  marketing  new  products  with  a  very high proportion of renewable raw materials, L'Or\u00e9al continued to  update  its  formulas  already  on  the  market.  For  example, L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  improved  its  Double  Extension  Carbon  Black Mascara, increasing the percentage of renewable ingredients from  40%  to  98%.  In  2022,  La  Proven\u00e7ale  launched  a complete makeup routine that is certified organic or certified natural.  Following  its  initial  success,  an  extension  to  this product range was launched in 2023.\n\nThe  Group  also  set  up  the  Green  Sciences transition programme to drive change in its portfolio of raw materials, with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  ingredients  have  a  favourable environmental profile.  To  do  so,  the  programme  is  based  on production and transformation processes that respect human health and environmental ecosystems.\n\nThanks to the Green Sciences pillars, the Group can optimise the  production  and  transformation  of  raw  materials  in  the existing  portfolio,  as  well  as  those  under  development. The  Sustainable Cultivation pillar will ensure biomass production while respecting best practices for agriculture and biodiversity,  soil quality, use  of  phytosanitary  products, greenhouse gas emissions and sound water management.\n\nThe biomass transformation pillars correspond to Biotechnology  and  Fermentation,  Green  Chemistry  and Extraction processes.\n\nIn  2023,  63%  of  the  newly  introduced  raw  materials  were renewable. In addition, 16 new raw materials based on Green Chemistry principles were introduced representing 25% of the total. In 2023, 76% of newly introduced raw materials comply with  the  biobased,  abundant  mineral  or  circular  (BAC) processes indicator.\n\nThe  Group  considers  biodiversity  to  be  a  key  source  of innovation. The planned increased use of raw materials from renewable sources must ensure that the ecosystems and the availability  of  these  resources  for  other  purposes  are  not adversely  affected.  The  Group  is  committed  to  a  sustainable and responsible supply chain (see subparagraph 4.3.1.2.2.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, 65% of our ingredients in formulas were from biobased sources, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes.\n\nTARGET 2030: 95%\n\nMore generally, L'Or\u00e9al is working on a number  of methodological  approaches  to  help  define  this  transition (abundant minerals, circularity, sustainable farming). The Group is working  on  developing  a  methodology  to  analyse  its agricultural practices from  a  qualitative perspective to complement  its  sustainable sourcing  initiatives  and  herald  a genuinely regenerative approach.",

        "page_content": "As part of its objective for 2030, the Group has worked with specialised  external  partners  such  as  BRGM (1) to  define  a robust scientific methodology aimed at qualifying the minerals used  and  ensuring  that  they  are  from  abundant  sources.  A joint presentation was given at the IFSCC (2) 2023 conference.\n\n## Respect for biodiversity and societal contribution\n\nIn 2018, as part of the Act4nature initiative, L'Or\u00e9al set a goal of  obtaining  100%  of  its  biobased  raw  materials  from sustainable sources by 2030. To be included in this category, raw  materials  must  meet  various  requirements  in  terms  of traceability, respect for human rights and compliance with the Nagoya Protocol.\n\n## Traceability of raw materials from sustainable sources\n\nTraceability  means  that  raw  materials  have  an  identified botanic and geographic origin.\n\nIn  addition,  the  traceability  campaigns  with  the  Group's suppliers  mean  that  100%  of  plant-based  ingredients  by volume will be traced in 2030 to their country of production, with a certificate of origin for each ingredient, or even to the biomass  production  site.  In  2023,  biobased  raw  materials comprised  1,778 (3) raw  materials  from  345  botanical  species cultivated in more than 100 countries.\n\n## Respect for human rights throughout the production chain.\n\nRespect for human rights in the production chain. According to  UN  principles  and  other  international  standards,  respect for  human  rights  applies  to  the  entire  production  chain  of these raw materials based on the key risks identified. In 2023, 100%  of  biobased  raw  materials  used  by  the  Group  were reassessed, in particular based on criteria such as respect for biodiversity  and  the  risk  of  forced  labour.  (see  SCAN  Index below).\n\n## Compliance with the principles of the Nagoya Protocol\n\nPlants  are  sourced  in  a  way  that  promotes  the  economic development  of  producers  and  respect  for  traditional knowledge  associated  with  biodiversity,  according  to  the principles of the Nagoya Protocol.\n\nOf  the  345  botanical  species  that  are  the  source  of  the biosourced raw materials used by the Group, around 5.5% (4) present significant biodiversity challenges (endangered species  and  impact  of  production  on  natural  environments) depending  on  their  geographic  origin  and  the  method  of extraction or production used. They are the subject of specific action plans initiated with suppliers and, if necessary, receive the systematic support of independent external third parties to manage the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe palm oil and its by-products segment is  the  subject of a specific 'Zero  Deforestation'  approach (see  below).  At  the end of 2023, 100% of supplies were covered by action plans with the suppliers concerned.\n\nOther  segments  represent  22%  of  the  portfolio  of  biobased raw  materials  in  volume  and  87%  in  number.  For  these segments, L'Or\u00e9al has defined sustainable sourcing challenges indicators (5) to assess their sustainability.\n\nThese  indicators  are  consolidated  within  the SCAN  index (6) , which enables priorities to be set in the sustainable sourcing action  plans.  The  Group  regularly  updates  the  information collected.  There  are  already  improvement  action  plans  in place with suppliers for 70% of the volumes (60% in number) of  raw  materials  that  have  sustainable  sourcing  challenges according  to  the  SCAN  index.  These  action  plans  aim  to ensure  sustainable  sourcing  to  achieve  the  goal  of  100%  of the Group's biobased raw materials from sustainable sources.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has also launched a support and learning programme for  more  than  200  suppliers.  They  are  now  trained  in sustainable  sourcing  of  raw  materials  to  guarantee  the traceability of raw materials delivered to L'Or\u00e9al and ensure that the associated supply streams are secure.\n\nDepending  on  the  level  of  environmental  and/or  social  risk identified on these streams, suppliers are asked to deploy the field  audit  procedure  for  producers.  This  procedure  is  based on  88  indicators  defined  by  L'Or\u00e9al  with  the  support  of  the Rainforest Alliance NGO  and  was  reviewed  in  2019 by  EcoCert, The  Biodiversity  Consultancy  and  The Danish Institute for Human Rights.\n\nSuppliers are also asked to make use of sustainable sourcing certifications adapted to their stream (Fair Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic etc.).\n\nBy  adopting  a  sustainable sourcing  approach  for  biobased raw materials, L'Or\u00e9al contributes to the social and economic inclusion of vulnerable population groups while respecting the environment.  In  2023,  93%  of  our  ingredients  were  from sustainable, traceable and biobased sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, 93 % of the biobased ingredients in our formulas were traced and sourced from sustainable sources (1) .\n\nTARGET 2030:100%\n\n(1) For the definition of the scope see the Methodological Notes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2016, L'Or\u00e9al launched a project for the responsible sourcing of rice bran from small rice producers in the Isaan region in north-eastern Thailand. L'Or\u00e9al works with the PUR Projet NGO and its supplier to support the OASIS cooperative in reducing the amount of methane produced by rice farming in the region and to improve its resilience to the effects of climate change.\n\nDemonstration plots were created to help demonstrate the impact of agroforestry techniques on farmers' plots. Learning courses on agroforestry and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) have been provided to encourage farmers to diversify their income, improve biodiversity and limit the methane emissions generated by rice fields. A programme to stabilise water access  has  been  conducted  through  a  bank  loan  scheme,  enabling  farmers  to  invest  in  irrigation  equipment  and  improve control of their water consumption.\n\nThanks  to  the  determination  of  volunteer  farmers,  the  project  has  successfully  demonstrated  to  the  region's  agricultural community the benefits of agroforestry and the way in which biodiversity and its protection can improve farmers' livelihoods. L'Or\u00e9al strongly encourages as many farmers as possible to adopt SRI practices. In 2023, 75% of the 766 local producers who benefited from the project were women.\n\n## Respecting biodiversity and measuring its footprint\n\nBiodiversity  loss  undermines  food  security,  health,  quality  of life and many services provided to our economies (pollination, air  and  water  purification,  soil  fertility).  It  also  effects  the Group's  resilience  to  climate  change.  The  conversion  of natural  ecosystems  for  agricultural  and  urban  development purposes  is  recognised  by  science  as  the  primary  factor  in biodiversity loss, followed by pollution, climate change and the introduction of invasive species (1) .\n\nThe  Group  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  the preservation  and  sustainable  use  of  biodiversity.  L'Or\u00e9al  for the Future reaffirms this commitment by placing biodiversity right at the heart of its goals.\n\nTaking  an  innovative  approach  and  with  the  support  of external  experts,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  scientifically  defined  land  use and  its  translation  into  MSA.ha  as  a  key  measure  for expressing  the  biodiversity  impact  linked  to  sourcing  its biobased ingredients in the territories.\n\nIn  2023,  it  was  estimated  that  palm-based  ingredients represent  over  60%  of  the  impact  linked  to  land  use  for  all biobased ingredients used by the Group.\n\nFor  the  record,  100%  of  our  palm-based  ingredients  are RSPO certified, with transparency that can be traced back to the mills for 96% of our volumes in 2023. Over the last nine years, the Group has developed five projects on the ground in partnership  with  external  experts  to  implement  sustainable agricultural  practices  aimed  at  improving  the  biodiversity footprint  in  palm  plantations.  In  2023,  31.5%  of  volumes  of palm-based ingredients were linked to projects on the ground, compared to 24.8% in 2022.\n\nIn the years to come, L'Or\u00e9al will continue to gradually extend reporting to include its full range of biobased ingredients and give greater consideration to the impact of its specific actions on supply chains, based on the latest scientific guidelines.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  ensuring  that,  between  now  and 2030, the land use required to produce its ingredients of plant origin  remains  unchanged  from  2019  levels.  The  following drivers have been identified as key to achieving this goal:\n\n- \u00b7 adoption of regenerative agricultural practices by suppliers in  order  to  improve  yields,  preserve  biodiversity  and  help farmers transition towards more sustainable agriculture;\n- \u00b7 implementation of an ambitious plan to develop alternatives  to  raw  materials  with  the  highest  impact, particularly  through  biotechnology  and  circular  processes, as part of the Green Sciences programme; and\n- \u00b7 support for rehabilitation projects for ecosystems adjacent to our strategic supply chains.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  work  on  different methodologies  for  assessing  the  impact  of  its  activities  on developing biodiversity in France and worldwide. As such, the Group takes part  in  the  work  of  the Science-Based Targets for  Nature network's  Corporate  Engagement  Programme, CDC Biodiversit\u00e9's B4B+ club (2) and the One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) collective.\n\nThanks to the quality of its traceability data, L'Or\u00e9al was able to analyse the importance of biodiversity relative to its supply areas, using the STAR metric based on IUCN data (see details in  the  methodological  notes  in  section  4.5).  This  analysis shows that:\n\n- \u00b7 approximately 70% of the land use related to the sourcing of  the  Group's  biobased  ingredients  occurs  in  countries where the risk of significant  impact  on  biodiversity  is  very low or low; and\n- \u00b7 30% of biobased ingredients come from regions where the risk of significant impact on biodiversity is medium, such as Indonesia  and  Malaysia  for  palm  oil  or  the  Philippines  for coconut.\n\nThese results will enable us to refine the supply strategy for each  plant  and  each  country  and  work  on  innovative alternatives.",

Since 2007,  L'Or\u00e9al's  action  plans  have  promoted  a sustainable supply of agricultural raw materials that could be a  cause  of  deforestation  (palm  and  soybean  oil,  fibrewoodbased products etc.).\n\nIn 2021, aware of the increasingly critical worldwide threat to forests  and  the  social  and  environmental  consequences  of deforestation,  the  Group  renewed  its  goals  after  consulting with  its  stakeholders.  These  new  goals  can  be  found  in  its 2030 Forest Policy .\n\nCapitalising  on  past  achievements  in  the  areas  of  palm, soy and wood fibre, the 2030 Forest Policy covers more raw materials,  prioritised  according  to  their  strategic  importance and the social and environmental risks identified. It is based on sustainable  and  responsible  management  throughout  the supply  chains  and  on  the  preservation  and  rehabilitation  of natural  ecosystems  adjacent  to  production  areas.  It  is therefore incorporated into the Group's sustainable sourcing strategy  for  its  ingredients  and  sets  new  goals  that  are specific to these raw materials.\n\nIn  addition to the environmental dimension, the 2030 Forest Policy  focuses  on  human  rights  and  improving  the  living conditions of the communities affected.\n\n## Results by commodity\n\nPalm: in 2023, L'Or\u00e9al consumed 206 tonnes of palm oil and 92,186 tonnes of palm oil and palm kernel derivatives. These derivatives  come  from  the  pulp  or  the  kernel  of  palm  fruit respectively.  These  oils  are  used  to  produce  glycerine,  fatty acids  and  fatty  alcohols  which  form  part  of  the  composition of the Group's products.\n\nAs  part  of  its  'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment,  L'Or\u00e9al  is rolling  out  a  specific  strategy  for  palm  oil  derivatives  in partnership  with  all  stakeholders  (producers,  NGOs  and suppliers):\n\n- \u00b7 100% of purchases of palm oil and palm oil and palm kernel derivatives have been certified as sustainable according to the RSPO (1) criteria since 2012; and\n- \u00b7 96% of the main derivatives come from identified sources (right up to the mill).\n\nPalm  -  certification :  100%  of  the  palm  oil  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al meets the standards and procedures of the RSPO, according to the Segregated (SG) model. 100% of the derivatives are also certified.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al had increased the proportion of its physically certified purchases to 99.8% RSPO Mass Balance by the end of 2023, compared to 99% in 2022. The remainder is covered by the RSPO Book & Claim model.\n\nTo  complete  its  certification  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  made  a commitment  to  have  at  least  30%  of  its  volumes  physically connected  to  field  projects  that  support  small  independent planters.  In  2023,  31.5%  of  these  volumes  were  physically connected  to  sustainable sourcing  projects  in  Indonesia  and Malaysia.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nPalm  traceability: in  2014,  within  the  framework  of  its 'Zero Deforestation' commitment, the  Group had pledged to trace the  main  palm  and  palm  kernel  derivatives  that  it  uses as far as the mills by the end of 2015. This was a complex task as  the  process  for  transforming  derivatives  involves  a  large number of players and many branches of the supply chains.\n\nWith the support of a firm of independent experts, an initial phase involving a survey of L'Or\u00e9al's strategic suppliers began in  2014.  These  suppliers  represented  more  than  half  of  the volumes  of  palm  and  palm  kernel  derivatives  supplied  to L'Or\u00e9al.  Since  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  updated  and  enriched  its data collection by extending the scope to cover all suppliers in order to be able to trace and identify the origin of 100% of its main  palm  and  palm  kernel  derivatives.  The  results  of  this work  show  that  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  are  the  main countries  from  which  supplies  are  obtained.  It  was  also established  that,  for  2022,  98.3%  of  these  volumes  of  palm and  palm  kernel  derivatives  could  be  traced  back  to  the refineries, 96% to the mills and 66% as far as the plantations.\n\nIn 2023,  based  on  this  work  and  with  the  goal  of transparency, for the fifth consecutive year L'Or\u00e9al published on loreal.com a list  of  the  1,013  mills  (944  in  2022)  indirectly connected to its supply chain (over 90% of its palm derivative volumes) and a list of its direct suppliers of derivatives.\n\nPalm - measurement tools: in  2016, L'Or\u00e9al sought to round out  its  evaluation  and  selection  tools  for  suppliers  in  this stream  by  developing  a  specific  tool,  the Sustainable  Palm Index . Every  year,  it  is  used  to  assess the  commitment, progress  and  achievements  of  direct  suppliers  in  favour  of sustainable  palm  oil.  It  also  evaluates  the  progress  made towards  the  'Zero  Deforestation'  objective  and  suppliers' compliance with the Group's requirements. First made public in 2016, this tool is available to all players in the supply chain.\n\nIn  2018,  to  take  its  commitment  further,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  a collaboration with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Transitions.  The  goal  was  to  develop  a  tool  to  evaluate refineries and crushers (which extract the oil from the kernels) on  the  basis  of  their  reporting,  policies  and  procedures. The  indicators  used  in  this  evaluation  were  aligned  with  the requirements  of  the  Group's  deforestation  standards.  This tool has been available and public since 2019. At the mill level, the  Group  has  used Global  Forest  Watch's  risk  assessment tool  since  2016  to  ensure  that  no  derivatives  traced  to mills  are  linked  to  deforestation.  In  2018,  the  procedure  for dealing  with  cases  of  non-compliance  with  the  'Zero Deforestation' commitment by direct or indirect suppliers was also  published.  Since  November  2019,  in  order  to  contribute to  the  sector  transformation,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  founding member  of  Action for  Sustainable  Derivatives  (ASD),  an initiative  coordinated  by  BSR  and  Transitions.  The  Group actively  contributes  to  ASD,  in  particular  by  sharing  all  its methodologies and tools developed since 2014.\n\n<!-- image -->",

North  Sumatra  is  an  area  that  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  For  decades,  millions  of independent smallholder farmers in emerging countries have relied on palm oil to make a living. Today, they are still largely left behind  in  the  necessary  industry  transition  to  sustainability  and  are  facing  numerous  challenges:  competition  with  large plantations, declining productivity and a lack of financial means to replace their ageing trees.\n\nIn keeping with its 'learning-by-doing' approach as part of the coalition of international and local stakeholders, the L3F has launched an unprecedented project to support 2,500 smallholder farmers in the region. The project especially aims to build a transparent,  deforestation-free  supply  chain.  To  achieve  this,  the  project  uses  agroforestry  models  adapted  to  local conditions, implements regenerative agriculture principles and preserves biodiversity in the plots.\n\nSince  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  supported  this  project,  which  will  help  to  regenerate  8,000  hectares  of  degraded  farmland  and restore  an  additional  3,500  hectares  of  local  biodiversity  in  addition  to  the  plots  in  surrounding  productive  and  protected forests. Going into the third year of the project has enabled L'Or\u00e9al and its partners to demonstrate that the regenerative agriculture practices the project promotes have been understood and widely adopted by farmers. A great deal of progress has been made with shade-loving ground-cover crops, selective weeding, the acceleration of organic fertilisation and organic inputs. Regenerative agriculture in palm oil production represents a balanced systemic approach to restructuring the top layer of various soils and demonstrating to independent farmers the impact of gradually reducing the use of chemical substances in distinct plots on the same farm.\n\nFor the second year running, 798 farmers were RSPO certified. We are currently working on launching a study on the financial autonomy of the women in the project to increase awareness of the issue of gender and the household economy.\n\nSoy: in 2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  consumed  355  tonnes  of  soybean extract  and  89  tonnes  of  soybean  extract  derivatives.  In 2023,  100%  of  the  soybean  extract  originating  from  Latin America used by L'Or\u00e9al was from certified sources (Identity Preserved  Proterra  -  IP)  or,  for  the  most  part,  from  a  land project certified RTRS, Organic and Fair For Life. This project aims  to  support  41  small  soybean  producers  in  Brazil  and Paraguay.\n\nPaper/cardboard: materials  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  for  its  packaging, the paper used for product leaflets and the cardboard used for boxes are certified as coming from sustainably managed forests (FSC  or  PEFC  certified)  (see  the  paragraph  entitled  'Materials vigilance and preservation of resources').\n\n## Improving the environmental profile of packaging, POS displays and stores based on the Group's sustainability principles\n\nThe environmental policy for packaging is based on three drivers (the 3Rs): Reduce, Replace, Recycle.\n\n| Reduce   | Packing articles and finished goods that are smaller and lighter in relation to the contents, thereby consuming  fewer resources.                                                                                                                    |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Replace  | Substituting high-impact materials and processes with alternative materials and processes with lower  environmental footprints, such as recycled materials, materials from natural and renewable sources and  processes with lower carbon intensity. |\n| Recycle  | Making sure that packaging can contribute to circularity by being recyclable.                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nThese  principles  are  applied  before  each  launch,  right  from the marketing brief. The Group harnesses them via a global, systematic  environmental  impact  measurement  process  for packaging, notably with the help of the SPOT measurement tool.  The  Group's  packaging strategy  fully  incorporates  its sustainability  commitments.  L'Or\u00e9al  rolls  out  and  regularly updates tools (databases, guides and procedures) to support the product development teams.\n\nSince  2018,  the  Group  has  used  a  specific  POS  programme that is  based on eco-design and circular economy principles. For our operated stores, we have drawn up an eco-design and construction  guide  in  line  with  the  Group's  sustainability principles. The Group shares the guidelines and best practices for  both  these  initiatives  with  its  suppliers  and  partner distributors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, 69% of created or renovated products had an improved environmental profile due to improved packaging.",

        "page_content": "## Materials vigilance and preservation of resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al requires food-grade (1) quality for all materials used in its  packaging  in  contact  with  products  or  a  beauty-grade (2) quality for rinse-off haircare products. The Group also works proactively  with  its  suppliers  to  ensure  that  all  its  packaging complies with European  Regulation  1223/2009/EC  on cosmetic  products.  Regular  audits  ensure  the  compliance  of the  filling  and  packing  articles  delivered,  thus  ensuring  an uncompromised level of quality and safety for consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  pledged  to  stop  producing  finished  products containing PVC . This  commitment  has  been  kept  since 1 January 2018.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has made a commitment that, by 2030, 100% of its biosourced  packaging  materials  will  be  traceable  and  come from sustainable sources, with no link with deforestation.\n\nTo  do  so,  the  Group  relies  on  its  materials'  traceability  and certification  to  ensure  they  come from sustainably managed forests  that  are  exploited  with  respect  for  populations  and forest  ecosystems  (preferably  FSC  certified  or,  failing  that, PEFC  or  any  other  certification  recognised  by  PEFC International).\n\nIn  2022,  99.6%  by  volume  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  wood,  paper  or cardboard  packaging  (primary,  secondary  and  tertiary) (3) could be traced to their country of origin (forests) (4) .\n\nThe  Group  deems  packaging  to  come  from  sustainable sources when its material is certified and when the packaging supplier holds valid Chain of Custody (5) certification. As such, in  2023,  89.2%  by  volume  was  FSC  or  PEFC  certified  and 83.4%  by  volume  came  from  Chain  of  Custody  certified suppliers.\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  member  of  the  Forest Stewardship  Council  (FSC)  in  France.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a member of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) International  since  2022,  with  the  aim  of  promoting  action aimed  at  strengthening  the  FSC  standard.  The  FSC  label  is the only label claimed on paper or cardboard packaging of the Group's products.\n\n## Reducing weight and volume to optimise the resources used\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the Group reduced by 4% in intensity the quantity of packaging used for its products, compared to 2019.\n\nTARGET 2030: -20%\n\nReducing the weight and volume of product packaging is an integral  part  of  the  design  stage.  It  is  a  major  driver for  improving  the  environmental  profile  of  packaging.  Every year,  L'Or\u00e9al  launches  new  initiatives  aimed  at reducing  the quantity of materials used in packaging.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nA process is in place to reduce the weight of existing products. Two initiatives implemented in 2023 are worth noting:\n\n- \u00b7 Lanc\u00f4me  updated  the  50  ml  jar  used  for  its Renergie, Hydrazen, Genefique and Clarifique ranges by reducing the weight of the glass, saving 142 tonnes per year. For example, the  jar  used  for  the Renergie  Ultra range  was  made  31% lighter  and,  for  this  range,  the  brand  also  supported  this reduction by launching a 50 ml refill.\n- \u00b7 reducing the weight of the 30, 50 and 90 ml bottles in the Yves  Saint  Laurent  Libre  Eau  de  Parfum  brand  saves 52 tonnes of glass per year. For example, the weight of the 50  ml  bottle  has  been  reduced  by  8%.  The  brand  also supported this reduction by launching a 100 ml refill.\n\nTo  reduce  the  use  of  resources  intended  for  packaging, L'Or\u00e9al is marketing a growing number of reusable products , i.e.  products  that  are  reloadable  or  refillable.  For  example, Prada  launched  the  refillable  makeup  and  skincare  Prada Beauty range. The L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel brand launched new 1.5 l pouches of shampoo for refilling the original bottles in hair salons.\n\nTo limit  packaging  volumes  for  its  finished  products,  L'Or\u00e9al has  developed  a  roadmap  for  reducing  packaging  at  the source,  as  well  as  methods  that  comply  with  and,  in  most countries, even go beyond local regulations.\n\n## Replacement with new sources of materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \uf052\n\nThe  Group  seeks  to  replace  materials  with  recycled  or biomass materials, or materials generated by technology that is not reliant on virgin fossil-based resources. In 2023, L'Or\u00e9al used  170,811  tonnes  of  plastic  in  its  primary,  secondary  and tertiary packaging. The Group aims to ensure that 50% of its plastics come from recycled or biobased sources by 2025 and 100% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2023, 112,435 tonnes of recycled materials (1) , including 68,951 tonnes in  primary  and  secondary  packaging,  saved  the  equivalent amount of virgin materials. 85% of the volume of PET (2) used by the Group worldwide is recycled PET, i.e. 38,976 tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeveral brands continue to incorporate PCR PET (3) into  their packaging:\n\n- \u00b7 the Maybelline brand has incorporated 100% of PCR PET into  its  makeup  vials,  particularly  in  its Sky  High  Cosmic and Primer Mascaras, but also for its SuperStay Matte Ink lipstick; and\n- \u00b7 the Shu Uemura brand uses 100% PCR PET in its Unlimited Mist bottles.\n\nThe  same  efforts  have  been  made  with  PE (4) containers, particularly Cerave bottles, launched in Asia and Mexico, and also  Elseve  Color  Vive  shampoo  and  conditioner  bottles  in Brazil, which now contain 100% PCR PE.\n\nOther brands also use up to 70% PCR PP (5) in their caps, such as  the  Micellar  Water  launched  in  Europe  by  the  Garnier brand.\n\nNarta  deodorant  cans  are  now  produced  from  PCR aluminium, 30% and 50% respectively in the 100 and 200 ml sizes.\n\nFor glass packaging, initiatives to integrate recycled glass into various product categories are ongoing, such as skincare with a  new  50  ml  jar  in  the Renergie, Hydrazen, Genefique  and Clarifique ranges from the Lanc\u00f4me brand, which is made of at  least  30%  PCR,  and  perfumes  with  Yves  Saint  Laurent's new MYSLF using at least 15% PCR glass in the bottle.\n\nTo  implement  new  circular  solutions  for  plastic  packaging, L'Or\u00e9al is working with an ecosystem of partners:\n\n- \u00b7 the L'Or\u00e9al consortium, together with Carbios, is developing a bio-recycling process. This involves using very specific  enzymes  in  order  to  recycle  PET  plastics  and polyester  fibres  more  broadly.  This  innovative  process  will produce  a  recycled  PET  equivalent  to  virgin  PET.  In  April 2019,  Suntory,  Nestl\u00e9  Waters  and  Pepsi-Co  joined  this consortium;\n- \u00b7 the  partnership  signed  in  2018  with  LOOP Industries\u00ae to depolymerise post-consumer PET into virgin-quality PET; and\n- \u00b7 the  partnership  signed  in  July  2019  with  PURECYCLE to produce recycled PP.\n\nIn terms of recycled plastic, the Group has begun working on this value chain, particularly with suppliers of plastic packaging  and  recycled  plastics,  by  involving  them  in analysing  and  mitigating  upstream  social  risks.  All  recycled plastic  producers  used  by  the  Group's  packaging  suppliers agree  to  comply  with  the  Group's  standards  and  commit  to this by signing the Letter of Mutual Ethical Commitment. The Group  has  had  a  social  audit  carried  out  at  each  recycled plastic  supplier  factory  located  in  a  high-risk  country.  A conforming social  audit  is  a  prerequisite  for  any  commercial relationship  between  recycled  plastic  suppliers  and  the Group's plastic packaging suppliers. Aware that transforming the  sector  requires  the  cooperation  of  all  its  stakeholders, including suppliers of plastic packaging, recycled plastics and other  end  products,  the  Group  actively  engages  with numerous stakeholders in order to shift the industry towards responsible sourcing.\n\n## Recycle: integration into circular streams\n\nThe Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \uf052\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the New  Plastics  Economy  (NPEC) initiative  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation.  This  initiative aims  to  rethink  the  life  cycle  of  plastic  so  that  plastic packaging never becomes a waste product and is re-inserted into  the  circular  economy in  the  form  of  materials  with biological or technical value.\n\nSince 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has been a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.  One  specific  goal  of  this  partnership  is  to  have 100% of our plastic packaging which are refillable, reusable, recyclable  or  compostable  by  2025.  This  goal  is  one  of  the commitments made by L'Or\u00e9al as part of the Ellen MacArthur Global Commitment.  These  commitments  are  monitored  by the annual Progress Report.\n\nIn  2023,  the  percentage  of  refillable,  reusable,  recyclable or compostable plastic packaging was 44%. This improvement corresponds  to  an  acceleration  of  refillable  formats  and  the removal of recyclability disruptors. For example, L'Or\u00e9al Paris removed the metal spring from the pump used for its Acid Bond shampoo in Asia. This measure means we were able to remove a recyclability disruptor of plastic.\n\nThe Group's brands have developed detailed sorting instructions  for  consumers  to  improve  the  recycling  of  their products.",

Lastly,  the 'www.beaute.fr ' platform supports consumers  in  their process to sort their beauty products at the end of life.\n\n## Environmental impact and tools\n\nTo  assess  the  impact  of  its  finished  products,  the  Group makes the following tools available to its design centres:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable  Product  Optimisation  Tool  (SPOT),  a  tool  for assessing the impact  of  the  product  (including its packaging,  formula  and  production).  Since  2017 , this  has made  it  possible  to  meet  the  Group's  sustainability commitments (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.1.);\n- \u00b7 a  tool  to  help  reduce  the  environmental  impacts  of transportation packaging of packaging components from suppliers to factories and transportation packaging of finished products from factories to the Group's distribution centres, particularly through optimisation of palletisation.\n\nTo share its research and results with the cosmetics industry , in 2018 the L'Or\u00e9al Group created the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for  Cosmetics (SPICE)  with  the  environmental consulting firm Quantis. The purpose of SPICE is to share the best practices and methodologies of each cosmetics player in order to harmonise and enhance the methods used to assess the  cosmetic  packaging  environmental  footprint.  L'Or\u00e9al shares  its  own  SPOT Packaging  methodology  through  the SPICE initiative.  Tracking  of  work  and  achievements,  as  well as the plan for the coming months, are accessible on the open platform www.Open-Spice.com. The SPICE initiative now has more than 34 members worldwide. The dedicated SPICE tool was launched in July 2020.\n\nTo  increase  transparency  towards  consumers,  L'Or\u00e9al  has initiated  the  roll-out  of  the Product  Impact  Labelling (PIL) tool. This involves allocating a score on a scale from A to E for the  environmental  impact of  products,  which  is  made available  on  the  websites  of  certain  Group  brands  for  eight formula categories (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2. B).\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  working  with  its  teams  and suppliers  to  implement  a  global  programme  to  eco-design POS materials and furnishings, which is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 14 robust and pragmatic golden rules;\n- \u00b7 learning support for teams and suppliers;\n- \u00b7 monitoring indicators;\n- \u00b7 sharing best practices; and\n- \u00b7 inter-team events on sustainability, including suppliers.\n\nThe principles behind these golden rules relate in particular to materials:  recycled  materials  and  those  from  biobased sources, their weight, recyclability or separability and optimisation of electricity consumption (for permanent POS). L'Or\u00e9al  tests  and  develops  circular  economy  processes  with its  suppliers  and  local  operators,  notably  in  the  context  of uninstalling, recycling or donations. L'Or\u00e9al continues to share its best practices, for example with the French Federation for Beauty Companies (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Entreprises de la Beaut\u00e9 FEBEA).\n\nIn 2023, L'Or\u00e9al continued the roll-out of its Sustainable Retail Box programme.

In  2023,  of  the  Group's 134 new or renovated stores, 104 (3) recorded an eco-design rate of over 100% and/or are certified LEED Gold.\n\nFor  our  permanent  POS  materials,  as  well  as  our  operated stores, the Group uses design firms that are experts in lighting to  optimise  energy  consumption  without  compromising  the quality  of  in-store  lighting.  The  pilot  projects  are  promising, in  particular  for  the  reduction  of  environmental  impacts. In  2023,  the  teams  continued  to  roll  out  the  operational guidelines launched since 2020 for new developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, 99% of advertising displays at points of sale were eco-designed and 78% of free-standing stores, whether new or refurbished, were designed and built in line with the Group's principles of sustainable development.\n\nTARGET 2025: 100%\n\n## 4.3.1.3.2. Involving consumers in the Group's transformation\n\n## A/ Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  develops  and  designs  cosmetic  products  that  meet the  needs  of  both  consumers  and  professionals  in  terms  of quality. As consumer safety is an absolute priority for L'Or\u00e9al, assessing the safety of these formulas and their ingredients is central to any new product development process. It is also a prerequisite for any new product being brought to the market. As  a  result, global  consumers  have  access  to  cosmetic products of identical quality, with proven safety records .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  factories  worldwide  manufacture  cosmetic  products that  comply  with  ISO  international  standards.  Nearly  all factories are ISO 9001  certified and implement  the requirements of ISO 22716 on Good Manufacturing Practice for cosmetic products. This standard sets out the requirements  for  production,  filling  and  packing,  control, storage  and  shipping  in  order  to  obtain  a  cosmetic  product that complies with the defined quality.\n\n100%  of  the  Group's  products  undergo  a  rigorous  safety assessment. A safety report is then established.\n\nThe Worldwide Human and Environmental Safety Evaluation Department specifically evaluates the safety of raw materials and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the  toxicological  profile of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  formulas  before  they  are marketed.  It  draws  on  data  from  a  wide  range  of  sources: literature, in silico experiments, in vitro tests on cellular models and clinical trials evaluating tolerance in humans. These same safety standards are applied everywhere to protect the health of consumers worldwide. Once the finished product is marketed,  potential  adverse  effects  are  monitored  to ensure the safety of the product over its lifetime.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group carries out this task with its international cosmetovigilance network, which collects, approves and analyses the adverse effects related to the use of a cosmetic product using recognised and rigorous methods. This  allows  for  appropriate  corrective  measures  to  be  taken where necessary.\n\nThe safety cycle is summarised in the following graphic:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  response to questions that civil society may ask regarding certain  substances  and  their  effects  on  health  and  the environment, three points summarise L'Or\u00e9al's position:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u00b7 cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u00b7 precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nThe launch of the website ' Au coeur de nos produits '  (Inside our  products)  in  2019  is  testimony  to  the  Group's  desire  for increased transparency on this issue.\n\nFinally,  production  quality  standards  govern  product  quality, at  all  stages  from  creation  and  production  to  distribution. Nearly all factories are ISO 9001 certified for their production and follow Good Manufacturing Practice in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard.\n\n## The product safety assessment process\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a process to ensure that all products developed by the Group, whatever the location of the laboratory in charge of the project, are subject to the same level of rigorous safety evaluation. The Environmental Safety Department uses a multidisciplinary scientific approach to carry out these evaluations at all stages of a product's life cycle. In this way, L'Or\u00e9al meets the safety requirements of the national regulations in force in all countries in which its products are sold.\n\n## A safety assessment is conducted for each product launched on the market\n\nProduct safety evaluation entails evaluating each constituent ingredient and the finished product itself. It is carried out on the basis of existing safety data and the latest scientific knowledge, and takes into consideration the conditions of use of the product. If necessary, L'Or\u00e9al conducts additional safety studies in qualified laboratories all over the world. The results are interpreted by experienced scientists with special training in cosmetic ingredient and product safety.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles,  rooted  in  both  scientific  rigour  and  responsiveness  to  societal  concerns,  lead  to  a  pre-emptive approach. This means that formulations are changed by removing and/or replacing certain substances based on new data.\n\n- L'Or\u00e9al's added value, in terms of assessing ingredient and finished product safety, lies in its investment for nearly 40 years in the development of predictive methods and tissue engineering, and their international regulatory recognition. For many years, the Group has invested in science and technology to create new evaluation tools that are used every day by safety assessors.\n- L'Or\u00e9al  also  works  closely  with  all  international  stakeholders  involved  in  relevant  industries  to  develop  alternative  crossdisciplinary solutions in the field of safety assessment.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nThis long-standing commitment means that the Group has not conducted animal testing in laboratories for any of its products since 1989, or 14 years before regulations required this. In addition, L'Or\u00e9al no longer tests its ingredients on animals. L'Or\u00e9al no longer tolerates any exceptions to this rule and this applies worldwide. The Group does not delegate such a task to any third-party  either.  Some  health  authorities  may  nevertheless  decide  to  carry  out  animal  testing  themselves  for  certain cosmetic products, as is still the case in China. For more than 10 years, L'Or\u00e9al has been firmly committed to getting Chinese stakeholders to recognise alternative methods and changing cosmetic regulations to eliminate animal testing once and for all. In  2014,  progress  was  made  to  put  an  end  to  animal  testing  of  some  products  manufactured  in  China.  Since  2021, non-functional products imported into China no longer need to be tested on animals if they are accompanied by a safety assessment and a good manufacturing practice certificate issued by their country of origin.\n\nUltimately, L'Or\u00e9al's products continually improve with technological innovations while consistently guaranteeing the highest level of safety for both consumers and professionals.\n\n## B/ Raising consumer awareness about sustainable lifestyle choices\n\nThe  Group  wants  to  empower  all  its  consumers  to  make sustainable consumption choices.\n\nThe SPOT environmental assessment tool, rolled out to all of the Group's brands (1) ,  established the environmental profile of all new products as of 2017.\n\n## Displaying the environmental impact of products\n\nAs part of its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group has created an environmental impact labelling system for its products  with  environmental  ratings  ranging  from  A  to  E  to help consumers make informed consumption choices.\n\nThis comparison tool for products within the same category is based  on  the  SPOT  methodology  to  measure  impacts,  which was developed with 11 independent international experts based on  the  directives  of  the European  Product  Environmental Footprint (PEF), to scientifically measure a product's environmental impact. It takes into consideration 14 planetary impact factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, water stress, ocean acidification or impact on biodiversity.\n\nThese impacts are measured at each stage of a product's life cycle  and  calculated  by  considering  raw  material  cultivation and extraction and product processing and transport, as well as the consumer usage phase and packaging recyclability.\n\nThis  information  is  accessible  to  consumers  on  the  product pages of our brands' websites. The first phase of the roll-out began  in  France  with  the  Garnier  haircare  category  in  July 2020.  This  labelling  is  now  available  for  12  Group  brands, 12 categories of skincare or haircare products, in 32 countries in Europe, North America and China.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  sectoral approach,  coming  together  with  its  competitors  to  form  the EcoBeautyScore  Consortium , which  aims  to  develop  a common  environmental  labelling  system  for  the  entire cosmetics  industry.  This  system  is  backed  by  a  scientific methodology for measuring environmental impacts in line with the recommendations of the European Commission, similar to the  one  used  by  the  Group  for  its  environmental  labelling initiative. Alongside the other members, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to  sharing  its  experience  in  this  field  within  the  Consortium in compliance with anti-trust legislation.\n\nIn  view  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  active  contribution  to  the  development of the EcoBeautyScore, in 2022 the Group slowed down the deployment of its own system for displaying the environmental  impact  of  its  products.  However,  in  2024  the roll-out to new markets will continue.\n\n## Environmental and societal commitment of L'Or\u00e9al brands\n\nConscious of the influence of its brands, L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to inform and mobilise their stakeholders around major environmental  and  societal  challenges.  In  2023,  23  brands took  action  for  a  cause,  in  partnership  with  associations involved  in  the  field,  and  conducted  awareness-raising campaigns with the wider public.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme, the  Group  has  made  a  commitment  that  over  four  million people  will  benefit  from  its  brands'  social  engagement programmes  by  2030.  In  2023,  the  23  brands  that  are actively  committed  to  a  social  engagement  programme enabled more than 4 million (2) people to benefit from support, in partnership with NGOs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Meeting the most demanding climate standards\n\n## 4.3.1.4.1. GHG assessment: an annual exercise\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  carries  out  an  annual  Greenhouse  Gas  assessment (GHG  assessment)  for  all  the  Group's  activities,  in  order  to measure its CO2 emissions and identify the action plans that will reduce its impact. Performed since 2007, this assessment is conducted in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) rules,  the international reference method for recording GHG  emissions.  It  makes  it  possible  to  determine the  Group's  total  carbon  footprint  in  three  categories, referred to as Scopes, and defined in subparagraph 4.3.1.1.3.\n\nIn  2023,  the  GHG  footprint  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  was estimated at 11,501 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n\n## Scopes  1  and  2  -  emissions  measured  and  reported on a monthly basis\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions measured and reported on a monthly basis  correspond  to  direct  emissions  from  all  the  Group's factories, distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres, as set out in subparagraph 4.3.1.1.3. Efforts to fight climate change on operated sites.\n\nThese  CO2  emissions  are  measured  by  all  the  Group's operated sites (3) and reported monthly using the monthly EHS reporting tool. In 2023, the Group reduced its GHG emissions within this scope by -74% compared to 2019.\n\n| Like-for-like basis (1)                   | 2022   | 2023    |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| L'Or\u00e9al Group                             | -65%   | -74%  \u2611 |\n| Industrial sites                          | -51%   | -65%  \u2611 |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | -87%   | -89%  \u2611 |\n\n## Scopes 1 and 2 - emissions estimated on an annual basis\n\nAs part of the annual exercise to produce its greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions  report  and  in  accordance  with  the  GHG Protocol, L'Or\u00e9al  includes  in  its  Scopes  1 and  2  figures  any GHG emissions related to its vehicle fleet and to the operated stores. As  explained  in  the  methodological  notes  (see paragraph  4.5.1.3.),  these  emissions  are  not  included  in  the monthly  reporting  conducted  by  the  Group's  sites,  but  they are calculated separately on an annual basis.\n\n- \u00b7 Vehicle  fleet:  in  the  same  way  as  it  calculates  the  GHG emissions  related  to  the  use  of  fuels,  heat,  steam, refrigeration  or  electricity  at  the  Group's  operated  sites,\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  also  calculates  the  GHG  emissions  related  to  the use of fuel and electricity by the vehicles in its fleet. These are calculated using a new methodology rolled out in 2021, which incorporates more granular data, thereby improving the quality of activity data and emissions factors, based on annual  reporting  from  each  subsidiary  on  its  fleet  of vehicles. In 2023, these emissions represented 47.3 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 98% of which was related to fuel consumption (internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, Scope 1)  and  2%  of  which  was  related  to  electricity  consumption (hybrid and electric vehicles, Scope 2).",

Climate change commitments\n\nThe Group's commitments to low-carbon operations management have led to initiatives and achievements aimed at  reducing  Scope 1  and  2  emissions  and  the  important categories under Scope 3.\n\nSince 2009, L'Or\u00e9al has involved its suppliers in the process of reducing its carbon footprint by encouraging them to participate in CDP Supply  Chain programme  (see subparagraph 4.3.1.2.2.)\n\nIn  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  committed  to  reduce  the  carbon  impact  of downstream  transportation  of  its  finished  products  by  20% per unit sold per kilometre between  2011  and  2020 (see paragraph 4.5.2.1).\n\nIn  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  undertook  to  define Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  across  its entire value chain and over the long term, in accordance with the  Paris  Climate  Accords.  In  December  2017,  the  SBT initiative  validated  the  Group's  proposal:  by  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed  to  reducing  Scopes 1,  2  and  3  greenhouse  gas emissions  by  25%  in  absolute  value  compared  to  2016  (with full coverage of the items of Scope 3, in accordance with the definition  of  the  GHG  Protocol).  By  2025,  the  Group  is  also committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  all sites it operates by 100%  through  energy  efficiency programmes and a supply made up exclusively of renewable energy.  The  SBT  initiative  re-evaluated  these  Scope  1 and 2 commitments in 2019 and they were considered to comply with  the  new SBT  1.5\u00b0C criteria.  Roadmaps  were  rolled  out within the different functions (packaging, research, sourcing, supply chain etc.)  so  that  each  one  contributes  to  the reduction of Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2 emissions. Specific tracking allows each of the segments to monitor its own performance.\n\nIn  September 2019, L'Or\u00e9al joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative,  a  call  to  action  for  the  climate  launched  by  a broad coalition of companies, civil society and UN leaders. The Group  has  committed  to  zero  net  CO2  emissions  by  2050, thereby  contributing  to  limiting  the  increase  in  global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn June 2020, in the context of the launch of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future and in line with its SBT commitment, the Group set out its  roadmap  for  2030.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  reduction, compared  with  2016,  of  25%  per  finished  product  in  the emissions  associated  with  the  product  use  phase,  a  50% reduction in the direct emissions of its strategic suppliers and a  50%  reduction  per  finished  product  in  the  emissions associated  with  product  transportation.  In  2023,  its  total emissions, including self-identified emissions in the indirect use phase, increased by 0.8% compared to 2016.\n\nAccording to the revised requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero standard, in October 2023 the Group re-submitted its new 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation pathway. On the date the Board of Directors approved the Management Report, L'Or\u00e9al was awaiting the SBTi's validation of this new pathway. This will be published in detail in the 2024 Universal Registration Document.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al works closely on the decarbonisation of all areas of its greenhouse  gas  emission  footprint.  Continuing  its  initial advances, and recognising the urgency of efforts to combat\n\nclimate change and the importance of limiting the increase in global temperature to 1.5\u00b0 C, the Group has made a new NetZero commitment covering mandatory emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. excluding the indirect use phase of its products, in order to focus on the sources of emissions closest to its direct control).  To  reaffirm  its  commitment  to  climate  action,  the Group intends to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2050. Residual emissions will  be  fully  offset  by  this  date.  Its decarbonisation  plan  covers  actions  throughout  its  value chain.  Its  short-term  target  concerns  the  decarbonisation  of Scopes 1  &  2  and  key  categories  in Scope  3:  goods  and services  purchased  by  the  Group,  business  travel  and downstream  transport.  As  part  of  the  SBTi  submission,  the work  was  done  to  update  the  reference  year  (2019)  which aligns  with  the  reference  year  for  its  other  sustainability targets  as  part  of  its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme.  Its new series of objectives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term reduction (2030) of -56% for Scopes 1 & 2 and 28% for Scope 3 on the Goods and Services purchased by the Group, its business travel and downstream transport in absolute terms compared to the reference base of 2019;\n- \u00b7 Long  term  reduction  in  total  emissions  (2050)  of  90%  in absolute  terms  compared  to  the  reference  year  2019, residual emissions being offset in order to reach net zero.\n\n## The main drivers of decarbonisation\n\nPackaging: Packaging  represents  a  significant  part  of  the GHG footprint of cosmetic products. Reducing this footprint is therefore a key objective in L'Or\u00e9al's decarbonisation process.  In  recent  years,  the  Group  has  been  working  to reduce  the  intensity  of  its  packaging,  by  optimising  it  (for example,  developing  options  for  refilling,  reuse,  weight reduction, size increase) along with increasing the proportion of recycled content.\n\nThe 2030 decarbonisation plan for the Group's packaging will revolve around five main priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing the intensity of packaging (for example, changing their shape and reducing their weight);\n- \u00b7 increasing  the  proportion  and  availability  of  reusable  and refillable formats;\n- \u00b7 increasing the proportion of recycled content in products (in particular  plastics  and  aluminium),  where  the  carbon footprint of the recycled content is significantly lower than its virgin equivalent;\n- \u00b7 working with suppliers on the supply of packaging materials with  a  low  carbon  footprint  (for  example  low-carbon aluminium);\n- \u00b7 researching  ways  to  reduce  the  impact  of  finishing techniques  (for  example  metal  plating)  and  encouraging suppliers to adopt, on a large scale, techniques with lower environmental impact.\n\nFormulas: L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  working  on  the  environmental impact of its  cosmetic  products  since  1995,  when  the  Group acquired its first environmental research laboratory to assess and reduce the environmental footprint of its formulas. Right from the design stage, raw materials used in the formulation of  products  are  evaluated  as  part  of  a  strict  ingredient selection process.\n\nIn  recent  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  focussed  its  decarbonisation  on removing and changing ingredients, as part of its worldwide target  for  95%  of  ingredients  in  formulas  to  be  biobased, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes.",

        "page_content": "To  reach  its 2030  target,  L'Or\u00e9al  will prioritise the decarbonisation of raw materials in four main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 reformulating  products  -  abandoning  ingredients  that come from petrochemicals in favour of natural ingredients and  replacing  ingredients  with  high  intensity  carbon emissions;\n- \u00b7 studying ways of reducing the impact linked to gases found in  the  aerosols  in  its  portfolio,  in  particular  gases  with strong  global  warning  potential  (either  by  replacing  them with  other  propellants,  or  changing  the  format  of  the products);\n- \u00b7 reducing the impact of palm and soya derivatives used in its products  by  taking  action  against  deforestation,  and  by encouraging  its  upstream  suppliers  to  adopt  sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices;\n- \u00b7 working  with  its  suppliers  on  the  supply  of  raw  materials with  low  carbon  impact,  on  the  energy  efficiency  of  their own  production  and  the  use  of  renewable  energy  where possible.\n\nDigital marketing: The  carbon  footprint  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  digital marketing  comes  mainly  from  emissions  linked  to  the production and transmission of its advertising content.\n\nThe Group has done a great deal of work to measure impacts relating  to  content  production  and  digital  media  activation, and  prioritises  the  integration  of  the  footprint  of  its  paid influencers.\n\nTo reach its 2030 target, the Group will step up its efforts to reduce impact, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 producing  more  responsible  advertising  content,  reducing emissions linked to travel and filming locations;\n- \u00b7 increasing the utilisation rate of the content produced;\n- \u00b7 reducing  the  impact  of  the  transmission  of  its  advertising content by using optimisation drivers in digital media, such as  adjusting  the  resolution  of  creations  according  to  the type  of  device  on  which  they  are  broadcast,  the  asset length for each platform, and media planning;\n- \u00b7 more  broadly,  working  with  its  suppliers  (including  its influencers) towards reducing their emissions.\n\nPOS  material  and  advertising  components: As  part  of  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group  is  working  to improve  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  advertising materials  for  points  of  sale,  by  gradually  increasing  the proportion of material that complies with eco-design principles.\n\nTo reach its 2030 target, the main areas for decarbonisation will consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 overhauling its POS, broadly applying its eco-design guidelines to  lighten  its  creations,  move  to  single-material  content  and reduce waste;\n- \u00b7 using more recycled materials for display materials;\n- \u00b7 continuing  to  reduce  electricity  consumption  linked  to permanent point  of  sale  displays,  by  optimising  them  and benefiting  from  the  positive  impact  of  its  retail  partners' switch to renewable sources of electricity.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nLogistics: L'Or\u00e9al  has  long  been  committed  to  reducing  the emissions  generated  by  the  transport  and  storage  of  its products.\n\nIts 2030 programme is built around the following main pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing  air  transport  by  prioritising  local  production  as much as possible, by adopting multi-sourcing approaches in the Divisions and optimising planning with a shift from air freight to rail/maritime;\n- \u00b7 rolling  out  our  new  solutions  to  promote  as  much  as possible  multi-modal  transport  (moving  from  road  to  sea, road to rail, for example)\n- \u00b7 optimising  the  load  factor  (particularly  on  road  freight  in Europe and North America);\n- \u00b7 using  fuels  with  the  lowest  emissions  (for  example  biogas, biofuel vehicles, SAFs or fuels with low carbon content for maritime freight, and electric vehicles and cargo bikes for the 'last mile');\n- \u00b7 encouraging upstream and downstream suppliers to reduce their  emissions from transporting products, particularly by developing  pilot  programmes  for  the  adoption  of  battery electric vehicles for long distances.\n\nSuppliers: The Group's total  footprint  is  mainly  linked  to  the impact of business activities and its suppliers.\n\nSince 2007, the Group has involved its strategic suppliers in the  process  of  measuring  and  reducing  its  greenhouse  gas emissions by encouraging them to participate in CDP Supply Chain programme. Carrying out these works is essential to the full decarbonisation of the Group's value chain. In future, the Group's  principal  objective  will  be  working  with  strategic suppliers, not only to reduce emissions linked to their Scopes 1 and 2 but also to their Scope 3. Its main areas of work are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 continuing  to  train  and  support  its  strategic  suppliers  in order to raise their awareness  of  climate  change challenges;\n- \u00b7 continuing  to  support  its  strategic  suppliers  in  identifying the main decarbonisation drivers in their business sector, by studying  ways  to  accelerate  their  progress  and  by  taking measures to promote the reduction of their emissions;\n- \u00b7 setting new expectations for its suppliers, so that they can develop their own climate transition plans, including Science Based  Targets  (or equivalent strategies to reduce emissions);\n- \u00b7 boosting the transparency and monitoring of the emissions of each supplier/product in order to monitor progress and stimulate change.\n\nOther  areas  of  decarbonisation: L'Or\u00e9al  will  reduce  all emissions associated with its business activity:\n\n- \u00b7 emissions linked to the production of machines purchased by the Group, supporting its suppliers in the decarbonisation  of  their  activities  and  by  encouraging circular economy models, particularly through the refurbishment and reuse of equipment;\n- \u00b7 the  footprint  linked  to  the  construction  of  its  property assets  portfolio,  particularly  through  leasing  low-carbon certified buildings, optimising its spaces, reducing occupied areas in new buildings;\n- \u00b7 its  business  travel,  by  implementing  a  stronger  mobility policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

L'Or\u00e9al plans to offset its residual emissions by eliminating equivalent quantities of carbon in accordance with SBTi 'Corporate Net Zero Standard'.\n\nThe  Group  intends  to  capitalise  on  the  solid  foundations  in place  by  2030,  which  will  be  strengthened  by  additional decarbonisation actions. Beyond 2030, the Group focuses on technological  progress  (and  more  favourable  policies)  to expand  the  range  of  decarbonisation  solutions  and  make them  more  profitable  to  apply  on  a  large  scale.  Its decarbonisation  drivers  beyond  2030,  which  will  be  detailed according  to  the  speed  of  technological  progress  and  low carbon emission solutions, may include:\n\n- \u00b7 zero carbon logistics driven by the increased use of cuttingedge solutions;\n- \u00b7 new  technologies  to  reduce  the  impact  of  its  products, including advanced recycling and the use of carbon capture technologies  for  the  production  of  raw  materials  for packaging and ingredients;\n- \u00b7 the  pursuit  of  innovation  in  all  its  commercial  functions: product/format innovation in  packaging,  optimised  use  of content in digital, continued work to overhaul promotional activities to reduce impact.\n\nThe realisation of its 'Net Zero' ambition will depend on the broader transformation of the energy system in all countries where  the  Group  operates  and  the  capacity  of  its  suppliers and partners in the value chain to evolve at the same speed and  with  the  same  determination.  L'Or\u00e9al  cannot  succeed alone  and  must  be  able  to  rely  on  a  favourable  political environment. The Group will continue to actively engage with its industry  and  political  decision-makers  to  promote  a broader transition towards a 'Net Zero' economy.\n\nOffsetting: the Group will prioritise reducing emissions in its value chain in its trajectory towards 'Net Zero' . In addition to its activities  to  reduce  its  carbon  intensity,  L'Or\u00e9al  plans  to  offset  its  residual  emissions  through  carbon  capture,  increasing gradually to full capture by 2050 at the latest.\n\nIn December 2023, L'Or\u00e9al published its transition plan on its website loreal.com ('Commitments').\n\n## 4.3.1.4.3. The  Group's  alignment  with  the Task Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) principles\n\nConscious  of  the  climate  emergency,  L'Or\u00e9al  hopes  to transition  to  an  innovative  low-carbon  company  model  and will make increasing contributions to fight climate change.\n\nThe acceleration  of  the  environmental  and  social  challenges requires  a  more  radical  transformation.  Since  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al has  been  one  of  the  100  leading  companies  to  join  the SBT initiative  by  aligning  its  path  to  decarbonisation  with  climate science. In June 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced its new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme. It includes a new set of very ambitious objectives  over  the  entire  value  chain  for  2030:  efforts  to combat  climate  change,  preservation  of  water  resources, forestry and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al publicly committed to adopt the recommendations  of  the  TCFD.  The  Group  committed  to incorporate  climate  issues  in  their  strategy  and  to  provide consistent, reliable and clear information to allow investors to include climate-related financial risks in their decisions.\n\nAlong  with  this  dynamic  move  towards  a  low-carbon transition,  L'Or\u00e9al  intends  to  fully  manage  the  risks  and opportunities  related  to  climate  change,  anticipate  their effects  and  ensure  its  resilience.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  adapting  its business  model,  governance  and  decision-making  processes, research and Operations in respect of its values and purpose: 'Create the beauty that moves the world.'\n\n## Governance\n\nEvery  year,  the  L'Or\u00e9al Board  of  Directors determines  the Group's strategic orientations, which integrate the challenges, risks and  opportunities  of  climate  change  and,  more generally,  the  issues  of  sustainability  (see  subsections  2.3.2 and 2.3.4).\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer , who is a member of  the  Executive  Committee,  reports  directly  to  the  Chief Executive Officer. She reports on the Group's activities every year  to  the  Board  of  Directors  or  to  the  Strategy  and Sustainability Committee.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer is responsible for defining  and  implementing  the  sustainability  strategy.  Her tasks include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  and  managing  climate-associated  risks  and opportunities,  particularly  through  her  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future sustainability programme;\n- \u00b7 leading an internal sustainability committee, which includes experts  responsible  for  the  rollout  of  these  programmes and  their  associated  policies.  These  experts  come  from the  Operations,  Research,  Public  Affairs,  Communication, Divisions and Brands departments;\n- \u00b7 guaranteeing  the  implementation  of  the  orientations  and decisions adopted by this Committee;\n- \u00b7 defining  annual  climate-related  objectives  and  ensuring their deployment throughout the L'Or\u00e9al value chain; and\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  level  of  commitment  of  all  of  the  Brands, Country  Managers  and  subsidiaries  in  implementing the climate and sustainability strategy. This implementation determines  a  portion  of  the  variable  remuneration  of  the Brand and Country Managers (see section 4.1.).\n\nThe mission of the Sustainable Finance Department ,  created in 2020, is to integrate the climate change-related environmental and social challenges from a financial standpoint.  This  Department,  which  reports  to  the  Chief Financial  Officer  and  the  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility Officer,  aims  to  develop  and  direct  Sustainable  Finance actions. This primarily involves enabling the Group to manage sustainable  and  financial  development  performance  in  an integrated manner and to coordinate their actions globally.\n\nIn 2022, this Department was in charge of updating the study assessing the financial impacts of climate change risks for the Group (see sections 4.1 and 4.2).",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nThe concept behind the main environmental risks covers risks related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's  business  activities  on  its ecosystem and the risks of the impact of climate change in the short  and  medium-term  on  its  business  model,  activity  and financial performance.\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  four  main  risks  and  three opportunities  relating  to  the  physical  and  transition-related risks  associated  with  climate  change.  These  risks  could  have potential consequences on the value chain, business activities and the development of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe in-depth analyses cover identifying these risks, approaching them proactively, evaluating their impacts using scenarios developed on two assumptions based on the 1.5\u00b0C and  3-4\u00b0C  pathways,  and  integrating  political,  economic, social, technological, environmental and legal trends (PESTEL analysis).\n\n## Scenarios\n\nThese  analyses  were  carried  out  according  to  the  RCP  1.9  and RCP  8.5 (1) scenarios  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change (IPCC) to identify and assess the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 A  'governed  transition'  scenario  on  the  basis  of  global warming of +1.5\u00b0C by 2100 (scenario RCP 1.9). It is based on a  structured  transition  and  restrictive  regulation,  with strong international cooperation, major increased consumer awareness of climate and external effects and, globally,  actions  to  anticipate  and  attenuate  climate change in a more responsible and united world.\n- \u00b7 A  'disorganised  transition'  scenario  on  the  basis  of  global warming of 3-4\u00b0C by 2100 (RCP 8.5 scenario). It is based on assumptions  of  limited  international  cooperation,  growing tensions on trade, economic stagnation or slowdown, significant physical impacts and, generally, a primarily reactive adaptation to climate change.\n\nTwo  timeframes  were  considered: a  medium-term  2030 timeframe and a long-term 2050 timeframe with the aim of identifying  impacts  associated  with  climate  assumptions  at these dates.\n\nBusiness  experts  from  the  Purchasing, Packaging,  Logistics, Research  &  Innovation,  Sustainability, Prospective and Consumer  Studies  teams  were  called  on  for  this  risks  and opportunities analysis.\n\nStudies  have  been  conducted  on  the  impact  of  the  supply of plant-based raw materials on climate change.\n\nAssumptions have been made on: carbon pricing trajectories, stakeholders  expectations  and  consumer  preferences.  These assumptions represent the main exposure factors of L'Or\u00e9al to climate transition risks.\n\nThese works enable the Group to adapt its policies and define its strategic objectives in regard to the risks and opportunities associated  with  global  warming.  Notably,  the  results  of  this study  and  the  action  plans  were  presented  to  the  Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Risks\n\nThe Group's risk review includes physical risks and transition risks  associated  with  Operations  and  changes  in  its  value chain  and  ecosystem.  Risks  as  diverse  as  those  associated with extreme weather events on the Group's infrastructures, or  the  risks  inherent  in  the supply  chain,  those  inherent  in resource  scarcity,  carbon  pricing  (taxes,  emissions  trading schemes) and their financial impacts or those related to the Group's reputation and consumer expectations are analysed. They  lead  to  impact  assessment  procedures  as  part  of  the scenarios  created  and  contribute  to  defining  strategic orientations.  The  risk  assessment  showed  that  there  is  a predominance of transition risks over physical risks; therefore, these are presented first.\n\nThe following main risks and opportunities were studied.\n\nRisk  1: as  a  world  leader  in  cosmetics,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  dependent upon  the  availability  of  the  materials  used  for  its  product packaging.  The  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  is accompanied  by  developments  in  the  design  of  more sustainable and innovative packaging and materials. Increased competition in the sustainable packaging materials market, resulting in a shortage of associated materials, could have  an  impact  on  L'Or\u00e9al.  These  factors  may  result  in  an increase  in  the  average  price  of  packaging  materials  and  in production costs. We have already embarked upon long-term action  plans  to  prevent  and  anticipate  these  risks  (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.1).\n\nRisk  2 : regulations  concerning  carbon  pricing  mechanisms (specific  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  carbon  taxes,  and  emissions trading schemes) are a major challenge for the Group and its suppliers.  In  this  context,  an  increase  in  the  price  per  tonne of  direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  suppliers  could  be reflected in the sale prices of their products and services and have  an  impact  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  operating  costs.  In  order  to mitigate  this  risk,  the  Group  is  working  with  its  suppliers, in particular through CDP Supply Chain, to ensure they devise and  implement  emissions  reduction  targets  and  associated action plans (see paragraph 4.3.1.2).\n\nRisk 3 : changes in consumer preferences towards consumption  choices  increasingly  influenced  by  product carbon  footprint  and  factory  overall  climate  performance could  have  a  material  financial  impact,  progressively  and  in the  medium-term,  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  If  this  risk  was  insufficiently managed, the reduction in consumer demand  could potentially  have  a  negative  impact  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  revenue. To  prevent  this  risk,  the  Group's  strategy  is  to  continue  to reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products  and  enable consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. They will be informed in a way that is both transparent and responds to  their  expectations  of  the  challenges  of  sustainability  (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.2). The study also took into account the more  general  assumptions  associated  with  the  company's transformation  as  well  as  changes  in  consumer  purchasing power, according to the scenarios considered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The analyses and estimates carried out to date indicate that the overall change in the costs of the main agricultural commodities (palm oil, coconuts, sugar cane and sugar beet, soy) would be more impacted in the medium term by changes in supply and demand than by the effects of climate  change  on  the  crop  yield  of  these  commodities. However,  extreme  weather  events  could  occasionally  affect the  availability  of  certain  commodities,  forcing  an  increase in  costs.  The  climatic  phenomena  el  Ni\u00f1o  and  la  Ni\u00f1a,  for example,  had  an  impact  on  the  availability  of  plant commodities  coming  from  Southeast  Asia.  In  light  of  this, action plans to give preference to sustainably sourced renewable raw materials have already been rolled out and are being developed (see subparagraph 4.3.1.3.1).\n\nOpportunity  1: a  market  opportunity  consists  in  innovating and  developing  products  adapted  for  consumers  located  in areas  of water  stress. One  of  the  consequences  of  climate change  is  the  increase  in  the  number  of  the  world's  regions facing periods of water shortage, particularly in urban areas. The  increasing  frequency  of  these  shortages  could  lead  to changes  in  consumer  habits  in  terms  of  showering  and hair-washing, for example.\n\nIn this context, L'Or\u00e9al could increase the development of new products, routines or new technologies that improve rinsing or save  water  in  the  use  phase,  thereby  increasing  consumer awareness of the challenges of water quality and availability.\n\nOpportunity 2 : globally, there is a trend towards an increase in the price of non-renewable energy in the medium term. This trend is linked to the regulations and taxes on fossil fuels, as well as the complex balance between supply and demand.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  progressive  elimination  of  the  use  of  conventional fuels in favour of renewable energy would protect the Group from increases in  fossil  fuel  prices,  contributing  to  operating costs that are lower than those paid by other manufacturers who  are  insufficiently  committed  to  this  energy  transition. L'Or\u00e9al has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy for all its operated sites by 2025, by  developing projects for self-supply  of  renewable  energy  on-site,  as  well  as  a  100% local  and  renewable  energy  supply  (electricity,  heat,  biogas etc.).  L'Or\u00e9al  has  already  started  on  this  path  with,  for example,  the  completion  of  a  series  of  projects  for  its  own consumption of renewable energy on-site in locations such as the  United  States,  Western  Europe,  Brazil,  China  and Australia.\n\nOpportunity 3 : current and future regulations and standards, which  are  linked  to  the  environmental  footprint  of  products and  their  labels,  will  help  increase  consumer  awareness  to these  subjects.  In  France,  recent  studies  suggest  that consumers  are  paying  an  increasing  amount  of  attention  to product labels and want  to make  more  sustainable consumption choices.\n\nThis may offer players in the cosmetics sector who have opted for fair and transparent communication on their environmental impact a competitive advantage resulting in an increase  in  demand.  The  multi-criteria  approach  of  L'Or\u00e9al to the impact of products beyond regulatory standards makes it  a  pioneer.  The  development  of SPOT, followed  by  the environmental  labelling  system,  meets  the  high  expectations of  consumers  and  informs  them  of  the  carbon  footprint  of products and a variety of other environmental criteria.\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al committed to a sectoral approach by coming together  with  its  competitors  to  form  the EcoBeautyScore Consortium , which  aims  to  develop  a  scientific  methodology for measuring environmental impacts.\n\n## Methods for managing risks and opportunities\n\nThe Ethics, Risks and Compliance Department identifies and assesses risks with all departments concerned. An additional risk  analysis  is  conducted  within  the  operational  entities,  in particular  for  the  physical  risks  associated  with  climate change.\n\nContributions  are  collected  from  the  main  operational managers  and  experts  in  this  area  worldwide,  across  all the Group's  business  activities and  geographic  zones. Climate-related risks  are  the  subject  of  a  regularly  updated, specific  approach  that  identifies  and  assesses  their  financial and  strategic  impact  when  the  reputation  or  long-term growth of the Group are concerned.\n\nThe Group's global risk map is reviewed regularly, validated by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Executive  Committee  once  a  year  and presented  to  the  Audit  Committee.  The  Group's  risk  review process  and  the  regular  update  of  the  climate  study  allow policies  and  priorities  to  be  constantly  adapted.  The  targets and  action  plans  implemented  as  part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future  are  a  significant  contribution  to  moderating  the climate risks that have been identified.\n\n## Measurement of results and reporting\n\nAs part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, these indicators cover the Group's  entire  value  chain  in  the  areas  of  greenhouse  gas emissions,  water,  biodiversity,  resources  and  waste.  They involve targets for 2030. Their progress is published annually (see subsection 1.4.2).\n\nIn  terms  of  climate  change,  the  goals  announced  in  the context  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  are  aligned  with  the Science-Based  Targets  initiative  that  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  in  2015. In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions over its  entire  value  chain  (Scopes 1,  2  and  3) by  25% in absolute value (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) and by 50%  per  finished  product  by  2030,  compared  with  2016. In  2023,  the  Group's  total  CO2  emissions  increased  by  0.8% compared to 2016 (see subsection 1.4.2).\n\nIn 2019, L'Or\u00e9al joined the United Nations Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative and made a commitment to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nA GHG footprint is prepared and published annually. It details emissions over all the items described by the GHG Protocol.\n\nThe Group's transition plan is also set out in detail in paragraph 4.3.1.4.2 and on its website, loreal.com ('Commitments').",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.1.4.4. Alignment with the European Taxonomy\n\nThe  European  Taxonomy  primarily  targets  sectors  that  the European  Commission  has  identified  as  having  a  strong potential  for  contributing  to  the  Taxonomy's  environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation,  sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and reduction of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity  and  ecosystems.  The  beauty  sector,  to  which L'Or\u00e9al  belongs,  is  not  one  of  the  sectors  identified  by  the Taxonomy to date.\n\n## Reminder  of  the  regulatory  environment  and  the  L'Or\u00e9al sustainability strategy\n\nPursuant to the European 'Taxonomy' Regulation, L'Or\u00e9al is required  to  publish  indicators  for  the  2023  financial  year highlighting,  since  2021,  the  eligible  share,  and  from  2022, the  aligned  share  of  its  sales,  investments  and  operating expenses  considered  sustainable  within  the  meaning  of  this Regulation. Until  2022,  disclosure  requirements  only  covered the  proportion  of  aligned  financial  figures  in  respect  of  the first  two  objectives  of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  which  are climate  change  mitigation  and  climate  change  adaptation. Since 2023,  the  Regulation  has  included  the  eligible proportion  in respect of the four new  environmental objectives (1) . In order to comply  with  these  disclosure requirements, the Finance and Legal, Operations, Real Estate, CSR,  Research  &  Innovation  Departments  have  jointly conducted  a  detailed  analysis  of  all  the  Group's  activities within the consolidated entities.\n\nEligible  activities  and  their  rate  of  alignment  with  the Taxonomy Regulation have been identified in accordance with the  instructions  of  the  Delegated  Acts by  verifying  whether they  contribute  substantially,  whether  any  of  the  five  other objectives set by the Taxonomy Regulation have not been met and whether they comply with the minimum guarantees.\n\nIn its classification system, the European  Commission prioritises business  sectors  with  a  strong  potential  for contributing  to  the  achievement  of  the  European  Union's environmental objectives. Within the meaning of the Taxonomy  Regulation,  L'Or\u00e9al's  beauty  activities  are  not considered  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  these  six environmental  objectives.  The  low  rate  of  eligibility  and alignment  of  the  Group's  Taxonomy  indicators  is  not  a reflection of L'Or\u00e9al's sustainability strategy nor of its strong commitment to combating climate change, preserving water resources, implementing  the  principles of the circular economy,  preventing  pollution  or  preserving  biodiversity throughout its value chain, a commitment it has demonstrated for many years.\n\nThe objectives of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future and the 2023 results are  described  in  greater  detail  in  subsection  4.3.1  and section 4.4.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Presentation of the eligibility and alignment results for 2023\n\nSales  indicator: like  in  2021  and  2022,  the  Group  has  not identified  any  eligible  turnover.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  dedicated  solely  to the  beauty  industry  and,  as  such,  its  activities  are  not considered, within the meaning of the Taxonomy, as making a significant  contribution  to  the  six  environmental  objectives and the sector remains a non-priority sector in terms of those targeted  by  the  Taxonomy.  In  particular,  its  industrial activities  in  the  production  of  raw  materials  are  not  covered by the Taxonomy Regulation under the heading 'Manufacture of organic  basic  chemicals'  under  the  mitigation  and adaptation objectives.\n\nInvestment indicator: As there was no eligible turnover, there were  no  investments  corresponding  to  activities  related  to sales, i.e. the manufacture of beauty products, that could be qualified as eligible. The Group's industrial and manufacturing investments are thus classified as ineligible by the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn addition, eligible investments do not include the \u20ac100 million allocated to Impact Investing funds intended to finance the regeneration of damaged natural ecosystems and develop  circular  innovative  solutions.  Investments  made  in funds  are  not  considered  eligible  expenditure  under  the Taxonomy  Regulation.  The  objectives  of  these  investment funds and the 2023 results are described in greater detail in subsections 1.4.2 and 4.3.1, paragraph 4.3.1.5 and section 4.4.\n\nAccordingly,  the  eligibility  analysis  of  the  investments  was therefore focused on 'individual measures' with regard to the climate-related  objectives,  as  well  as  on  the  four  new objectives (2) .  These investments do not reflect the entirety of the  Group's  financial  efforts  towards  implementing  the sustainability strategy.\n\nEligible  investments  identified  under  the  climate  mitigation and  adaptation  objectives  primarily  correspond  to  leases  on premises  that  are  capitalised  in  accordance  with  IFRS  16 (94%). The breakdown of eligibility between these objectives is specified in the regulation tables.\n\nOther  eligible  investments  under  the  two  climate  objectives have  been  identified  in  other  activities,  mainly  enabling activities, as shown in the regulation tables (6%).\n\nAnalysis  of  the  last  four  objectives  of  the  Taxonomy Regulation  identified  eligible  investments  related  to  recycled water  production  facilities  on  industrial  sites  under  the transition  towards  a  circular  economy  objective.  These investments  were  finally  evaluated  as  not  significant  with regard  to  the  total  investments.  They  were  therefore  not reported  as  part  of  the  Taxonomy  activities  defined  for  the circular  economy  objective.  This  investment  does  not  reflect the action plans and results obtained by the Group in terms of preserving water resources, biodiversity, resources and waste reduction on operated sites, as described in subparagraphs 4.3.1.1.4, 4.3.1.1.5 and 4.3.1.1.6.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  also  include  leases  that  have been capitalised in accordance with IFRS 16, which relate to A\u0113sop,  a  company  that  entered  the  Group's  scope  of consolidation at the beginning of September 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the amount of eligible CapEx (1) stood at \u20ac434 million. The variation in the eligible balance in 2023 compared to the 2022  financial  year  is  primarily  the  result  of  the  frequency of lease renewals and the addition of A\u0113sop data for this first financial year.\n\nIn 2023,  aligned  investments  for  the  climate  change mitigation  objective  were  \u20ac139  million,  with  \u20ac114  million invested for the climate change  adaptation  objective. Alignment  under  the  four  new  objectives  is  not  required  for\n\nthis  financial year. The alignment of capitalised leases under IFRS 16 relating to A\u0113sop has not been tested in view of the entity's recent integration.\n\nIn 2022, the amount of aligned CapEx (2) stood at \u20ac180 million. The variation in the aligned balance in 2023 compared to the 2022 financial year can be explained by the same reasons as the  data  for  eligibility  and  the  recent  integration  of  A\u0113sop. These variations do not correlate with the Group's investment policy on actions to adapt to or mitigate climate change.\n\nTotal  investments  as  defined  by  the  Taxonomy  Regulation (\u20ac2,810  million  in  2023)  includes  inflows  of  tangible  and intangible  assets  for  the  financial  year  under  review,  before depreciation and before any remeasurement, including those resulting  from  revaluations  and  impairment,  for  the  relevant financial year, with the exception of variations in fair value.

In 2023, the Group worked on a property-specific sustainability strategy for operational roll-out in 2024, that will improve  the  performance  of  all  the  new  assets acquired. The Group will continue to update and ensure the implementation  of  the  Purchasing  Charter  and  the Sustainable Design and Construction Guide for construction and leasing projects, in order to best address the environmental issues described in the Taxonomy.\n- \u00b7 Compliance  with  the  minimum  safeguards: the  Group meets  the  requirements  on  minimum  safeguards  listed  in the  Platform  on  Sustainable  Finance's  (PSF)  report.  The four themes are specified in other sections:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a  Group-wide  Code  of  Ethics as  well  as  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Vigilance  Plan,  which  contains reasonable due diligence measures intended to prevent the risk of serious adverse impacts on Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms,  as  well  as  health,  safety  and the environment within the framework of a best efforts obligation (see paragraphs 3.4.4.1. and 3.4.5.1.);\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al has a corruption risk prevention policy (see subsection 4.3.4.);\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al considers that the contribution of taxation is an integral part of its CSR (see subsection 4.3.5.); and\n- \u00b7 the Group's Legal Charter reaffirms the obligation to respect local laws and in particular sets out the internal principles for the right to competition (see paragraph 3.5.3.4.).\n\nIn connection with the European Commission communication of  16  June  2023  on  minimum  safeguards  (2023/C  211/01) (3) and  in  connection  with  the  SFDR  (Sustainable  Finance Disclosure  Regulation),  we  confirm  that  the  Group  is  not exposed to controversial weapons.",

        "page_content": "The  method  for  identifying  eligible  and  aligned  projects  and their  amounts  is  described  in  the  methodology  note  (see section 4.5.). This method will be integrated into the Group's investment  validation  processes  in  a  more  systematic  way over  the  coming  years.  The  Group  will  continue  to  adapt  its alignment and eligibility analysis and methodology in light of changes  to  the  regulations,  listed  activities  and  technical review criteria relating to the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nOperating expenses indicator: As there were no eligible sales, there were no operating expenses corresponding to activities related to sales that could be qualified as eligible. As a result, the  various  measures  implemented  especially  to  reduce  the carbon  footprint  of  the  Group's  products  have  not  been considered in the performance indicators relating to operating expenses.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nThe OpEx (1) denominator required by the Taxonomy Regulation is primarily composed of R&I costs (\u20ac1,289 million in  2023).  It  represents  a  low  percentage  of  the  Group's operating expenses. In light of this low weighting, the Group applies the Taxonomy Regulation exemption that allows them not to calculate the OpEx numerator and reports this amount as 0.\n\nFurthermore, L'Or\u00e9al concluded that its Research & Innovation programmes are not eligible because they do not fall within the scope of the activities currently covered by the Taxonomy  (heavy  chemicals).  R&I  at  L'Or\u00e9al  is  focused towards Green Sciences (as described in paragraphs 1.2.8 and 4.3.1.3.1). The allocated annual budget for this was \u20ac1,289 million in 2023.\n\nPROPORTION OF NET SALES, CAPEX, OPEX FROM TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE OR TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES BY ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE - INFORMATION FOR 2023\n\n## Proportion of net sales/total sales\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned by objective   | Taxonomy-eligible by objective   |\n|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| CCM | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| CCA | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| WTR | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| CE  | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| PPC | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| BIO | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n\n## Proportion of CapEx/Total CapEx\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned by objective   | Taxonomy-eligible by objective   |\n|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| CCM | 5%                              | 22%                              |\n| CCA | 4%                              | 4%                               |\n| WTR | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| CE  | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| PPC | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| BIO | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n\n## Proportion of OpEx/Total OpEx\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned by objective   | Taxonomy-eligible by objective   |\n|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| CCM | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| CCA | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| WTR | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| CE  | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| PPC | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n| BIO | 0%                              | 0%                               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contributing to solving the environmental challenges of the world\n\nIn  addition  to  transforming  its  economic  model,  the  Group's ambition is to help to solve some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges.\n\n## 4.3.1.5.1. Accelerating the development of the circular economy\n\nConscious of the growing pressure on natural resources and the  global  waste  crisis,  at  the  end  of  2020  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a global  investment  fund  dedicated  exclusively  to  the  circular economy, called the Circular Innovation Fund (CIF). It aims to finance  companies  that  are  innovating  in  the  areas  of recycling, plastic waste management and materials from the bioeconomy (1) .\n\nThis  international  fund  is  co-managed  by  Cycle  Capital Management  and  Demeter.  The  fundraising  was  completed at the end of 2023, with \u20ac111 million raised and 12 co-investors gathered.  As  the  primary  sponsor  of  the  CIF,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed to investing a total budget of \u20ac50 million in  this Fund. At the end of 2023, the amount committed by L'Or\u00e9al is \u20ac12.6  million.  More  than  425  investment  projects  were analysed  during  2023,  with  5  additional  investments  being made,  bringing  the  total  number  of  investments  since  the Fund was created to 8. In 2023, the CIF has committed and invested  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac12.33  million,  bringing  the  total amount invested since the Fund was created to \u20ac20.81 million. In  July  2023,  the  CIF  launched  its  first  edition  of  the accelerator,  a  tailor-made  six-month  programme  to  support the  development  of  the  business  and  the  impact  of  four circular  start-ups.  The  start-up  Sparxell,  selling  pigments made  from  biobased  materials (2) , benefited from the accelerator  in  2023.  The  call  for  applications  for  the  2024 edition is planned for March.\n\n## 4.3.1.5.2. Contributing to the regeneration of nature\n\nAs part of its commitment to preserving biodiversity, L'Or\u00e9al launched  the L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Nature  Regeneration (3) in 2020. This \u20ac50 million impact investment fund, managed by Mirova, is intended to combine financial performance with the creation  of  environmental  and  social  value.  By  supporting projects to rehabilitate (4) degraded soils, regenerate mangroves, and restore marine areas and forests, the L'Or\u00e9al Fund  for  Nature  Regeneration  aims  to  help  preserve  or restore  one  million  hectares  of  ecosystem,  to  capture  15  to 20  million  tonnes  of  CO2  and  create  hundreds  of  jobs  by 2030. Since  the  fund  was  launched,  more  than  one  hundred\n\nprojects have been considered for the purposes of building the investment  portfolio.  At  the  end  of  2023,  24  projects  were selected for further study, and 16 investment projects totalling more than \u20ac27 million were validated. As an example, in April 2023, the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Nature Regeneration invested in the ReforesTerra project, which aims to restore 2,000 hectares of land degraded by pastures (5) -  one  of  the greatest  challenges  facing  the  Amazon.  The  project  will engage with smallholder farmers (6) to directly plant new trees and create a favourable environment for natural regeneration of  the  forests  in  the  lower  Rio  Jamari  basin  in  Rond\u00f4nia, covering  75%  of  the  project  area.  The  remaining  25%  will benefit from planting in small clusters (7) that  attracts  wildlife to naturally propagate new forests. This project is one of the largest Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) projects in Brazil.\n\n## 4.3.1.5.3.  Responding to the climate emergency\n\nIn 2023, L'Or\u00e9al created a new endowment fund: the L'Or\u00e9al Climate  Emergency Fund. With a budget of \u20ac15 million,  it  is intended to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities in the face of climate disasters. It supports communities in the most exposed areas by enabling expert partner organisations to help them prepare for and recover from such events.\n\nThe  funds  will  be  directed  towards  two  types  of  actions: 'prepare',  to  help  minimise  the  impact  of  climate  disasters before  they  occur,  through  disaster  planning  and  early warning systems; and 'repair', to restore essential infrastructures and vital services such as healthcare, housing and access to food and water when disaster strikes. The first two  L'Or\u00e9al  Climate  Emergency  Fund  recipients  are  The Solutions  Project,  a  US-based  non-profit  organisation  and Start  Network,  a  global  alliance  of  more  than  80  local, national  and  international  NGOs,  that  both  work  on  the frontline  to  provide  early  and  effective  responses  when  and before humanitarian crises strike.\n\n## 4.3.1.6. Issuance of a sustainability-linked bond\n\nOn 22 March 2022, the Group issued its  first  sustainabilitylinked bond.  This  fixed-rate  issue,  which  has  a  maturity  of four years and three months and amounts to \u20ac1,250 million, is accompanied by  a  coupon  of  0.875%  per  year.  It  is  aligned with the Group's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, which covers all financial instruments with characteristics that are linked to the sustainability objectives.\n\nThe  bond  was  established  with  reference  to  the 2020 Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles ('SLBP 2020') as defined by the International Capital Market Association.",

Human Resources Policy\n\nThe mission of L'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources Department (HR) is  to  support  the  Group's  growth  and  its  transformation initiatives.  The  Group  places  people  at  the  heart  of  its organisation.  L'Or\u00e9al's  HR  strategy  is  built  on  this  double conviction:  individualised  management  linked  with  collective strength.\n\nTo meet the challenges of a world that is constantly changing, which  impact  both  the  organisation  and  relationships  with work, the Group initiated a process of transformation to adjust its  model  to  new  aspirations.  It  is  implementing  dedicated HR policies on recruitment, development and engagement. The Chief  Human  Relations  Officer,  who  is  member  of  the Executive Committee, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer on a regular basis.\n\n## Recruiting, developing and engaging: putting employees at the centre of the business model\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  placed  the  individual  at  the  centre  of  its model,  convinced  that  the  qualities  of  each  one  contribute to the performance of all. L'Or\u00e9al finds, recruits, and supports its employees  with  a  long-term  engagement  vision.  Learning  and development  play  a  central  role  all  along  their  professional careers.  In  order  to  fully  perform  their  function  as  strategic partner,  Human  Resources  integrates  the  technological  and digital  dimensions  and  takes  into  account  strong  challenges such as social responsibility.\n\nHR plays a central role in the transformation of work methods and management culture. Thus, they supported the rollout of the Simplicity programme , initiated in 2016, to foster a management style based on trust, leaving room to initiative, cooperation and development.  The  programme  was  supported  by  a  major learning  programme, LeadEnable  for  Simplicity , and  specific goals target the highest level of the Group.\n\n(1)\n\nSince  2020,  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and their Management Committees have been evaluated by their peers and their teams via the Leadership Survey .\n\nIn  2023,  we  launched  the Simplicity  2 programme,  which structures  new  ways  of  working  to  reduce  workloads  and focus more closely on tasks with high added value.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  growth  cannot  be  separated  from social progress. To support this conviction, the L'Or\u00e9al Share &  Care programme, created in  2013  and  deployed  in  all  our subsidiaries,  offers  employees  a  set  of  benefits  organised around  four  pillars:  social  protection,  healthcare,  work/life balance  and  the  working  environment.  This  programme  is constantly evolving and it is regularly improved, most recently in  2023  to  support  employees  with  cancer,  to  ensure  it remains relevant and meets employees' needs and expectations at every key moment of their lives.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  providing  learning  programmes  for 100% of its employees every year, worldwide, with the aim of developing their employability over the long-term.\n\nAs part of a responsible and innovative social policy, in 2021, L'Or\u00e9al  has  also  developed  L'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth,  a  global programme  to  promote  the  employment  of  young  people, which provides them with professional opportunities. 25,000 young people benefited from this in 2023.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  offers  its  employees  a  policy  of  sharing  its  growth. Profit-sharing programmes  have  been  in  place  globally  for many  years.  In  2023,  a  total  of  \u20ac461  million  was  paid  out under  these  schemes.  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  an  employee  share ownership plan in 2018, 2020 and 2022. Over 37,000 Group employees worldwide have been able to become shareholders in L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nQuality social dialogue is also one of the essential components of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  model.  It  illustrates  the  Group's  desire  to involve employees and their representatives to its development.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n<!-- image -->",

Preserving employee health and safety\n\n## An ambitious shared health and safety policy\n\nThe Health (H) and Safety (S) policy is a priority objective of the  Group's  general  policy  and  one  of  its  main  managerial pillars.  All  managers are evaluated on their ability to apply it and  on  their  results  in  this  area.  It  is  based  on  the fundamentals presented in subparagraph 4.3.1.1.1.\n\nMoving towards 'zero accidents' is the ambition that L'Or\u00e9al has  set  for  the  safety  of  its  employees.  The  Group  has implemented  programmes  aimed  at  reducing  risks  and ensuring regular improvement  in results through the leadership  of  managers  and  the  involvement  of  staff  at  all levels.\n\nThe  Group  strives  to  ensure  regulatory  compliance  with  its own standards on its  sites  (industrial  or  administrative  sites, research centres, stores), and checks that its subcontractors and  suppliers  manage  the  health  and  safety  of  people through a programme of external audits.\n\n128  lost  time  accidents  (L'Or\u00e9al  and  temporary  workers)  were reported in 2023, compared with 118 lost time accidents in 2022.",

Since  then,  with  the support of members of the Executive Committee, the Group has  rolled  out  a  mandatory Road  Safety programme  for  all employees identified as working on the road.\n\n## Priorities\n\nThe main Health and Safety priorities and orientations relate to the following nine areas:\n\n- 1. definition  and  deployment  of  strategy  and  action  plans to  achieve  the  targets  set:  Lost  Time  Injury  Rate  (LTIR) <0.5 for all Group sites;\n- 2. commitment and visible participation by management;\n- 3. initiatives  to  fight  the  most  frequent  incidents,  which include a worldwide ergonomics programme and a specific LIFE programme on potentially serious accidents (see subparagraph 4.3.1.1.1);\n- 4. Health and Safety organisation and practices in compliance  with  the  Group's  standards  with  ISO  45001 certification for all Operations sites;\n- 5. specific learning programme for managers, EHS managers, operators/technicians and for all employees;\n- 6. continuous  improvement  of  the  Health  and  Safety management systems at all sites;\n- 7. active administrative staff participation;\n- 8. sharing of resources, feedback and best practices; and\n- 9. 95% of the Group's factories are ISO 45001 certified for their safety policy.\n\n## A global programme dedicated to improving Health and Safety\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has programmes with specific and innovative tools to achieve excellence in safety, which is based on four areas:\n\n- \u00b7 a  strategy  based  on  risk  management,  the  search  for excellence  and  the  sharing  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  culture  outside the Group;\n- \u00b7 analysis of safety and health risks with the following tools: Global  Hazard  Assessment  Procedure (GHAP),  Safety Hazard  Assessment  Procedure  (SHAP),  Ergoval,  Process Safety Management  (PSM),  Chemical  Risk Evaluation (CHERIE);\n- \u00b7 analysis of the root causes for the occurrence of incidents/ accidents with the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) tool; and\n- \u00b7 the use of a correct prevention tool at the right time.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recruiting and supporting talent\n\nThe Group is continually  enriching  and  diversifying  its  global talent pool to meet its present and future needs.\n\nThe  recruitment  teams  are  tasked  with  attracting  the  best talent in all countries in which L'Or\u00e9al Group operates, so as to form diverse teams that resemble our consumers and integrate all  cultures.  The recruitment policy is implemented locally by a local network of recruitment experts covering all countries.\n\nTo select the best talent with the most diversified profiles who are  capable  of  contributing  to  its  transformation,  L'Or\u00e9al recruits on the basis of a candidate's skills and potential. The Group  is  putting  in  place  innovative  means  to  ensure  its recruitment  is  more  inclusive.  The  aim  is  to  capitalise  on candidates'  strengths  such  as  ambition,  resilience,  empathy, judgement, and learning agility.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique  know-how  in  working  with  higher education  to  identify  and  recruit  new  graduates.  The  Group relies on the following schemes, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Brandstorm,  the  Group's  innovation  competition  for students. In 2023, the 31 st year of this competition brought together  more  than  92,000  students  from  72  different countries, in a completely digital format, enabling them to immerse  themselves  in  the  beauty  industry  and  find  out about the Group's values of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n- \u00b7 Management  Trainee  programme L'Or\u00e9al  SeedZ is a rotational programme that prepares more than 1,000 new graduates across the world for major business responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7 the  French  International  Business  Internship  (Volontariat International  en  Entreprise  -  VIE)  scheme,  which  enabled more  than  150  young  Europeans  under  the  age  of  29 complete  an  internship  of  between  12  and  24  months  in 16 Group subsidiaries in 2023.",

        "page_content": "The  Group  is  continually  improving  its  powerful  digital communications  system  which  allows  to  enhance  the employer  image,  to  share,  daily  and  transparently,  the richness of its jobs and the diversity of its career paths and to explain its culture. L'Or\u00e9al's Social Media  strategy  in recruitment  is  considered  to  be  an  industry  benchmark. A  strong  presence  on  LinkedIn,  with  more  than  4.7  million followers, helps with proactively recruiting the best talent.\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  ranked  by  Universum as one of the best employers in France and in the world.\n\nAn International team provides L'Or\u00e9al recruiters around the world  with  cutting  edge  digital  tools  to  efficiently  select  the best  candidates  from  among  over  1.3  million  applications received. Paradox is one of a range of such solutions that use technology,  including  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  to  provide greater  efficiency,  improve  the  candidate  experience  and target  a  broader  diversity  of  backgrounds.  The  Group  has been  moving  in  this  direction  since  2017  and  imposes  the highest  standards  to  ensure  a  responsible  and  ethical approach in its design and use of AI.\n\nIn 2023, the recruiter community worked together on several topics, such as the candidate experience, mastering computer tools  and  data  quality,  as  well  as  learning  for  managers involved in the recruitment process.\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to roll out its global L'Or\u00e9al for Youth  programme,  through  which  it  created  25,000  job opportunities per year for those under the age of 30. In 2023, this objective remains unchanged, particularly with regard to L'Or\u00e9al BOOST, which gives 20,000 young people access to the Coursera learning platform, or to mentoring and coaching initiatives to support  and  strengthen  the  employment prospects of young people all over the world. The programme has been enriched with new initiatives, such as masterclasses led by business leaders.\n\nSuccessful integration of new employees lays the groundwork for  a  lasting,  quality  relationship  with  the  Company.  The  FIT integration  programme  provides  everyone  with  the  keys  to success within the Group, both from  an  operational standpoint and in terms of sharing the corporate culture.\n\n## 4.3.2.3.  Training and developing employees throughout their working life\n\nL'Or\u00e9al considers the development of its employees as one of the main drivers of its performance and its transformation. In terms  of  learning,  the  Group's  ambition  is  to  develop  the potential and employability of each employee throughout their lives, and to prepare tomorrow's leaders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## NUMBER OF HOURS OF LEARNING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BREAKDOWN BY GEOGRAPHIC ZONE\n\n|               | Number of hours   |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Europe        | 1,112,926         |\n| Latin America | 415,432           |\n| North America | 424,995           |\n| North Asia    | 1,101,895         |\n| SAPMENA + SSA | 417,651           |\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's strategy for developing its employees and ensuring a competitive advantage is based on four drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring  that  employees  have  mastered  the  core  skills required for their role;\n- \u00b7 providing an unparalleled learning experience that motivates employees to continue learning;\n- \u00b7 enabling  the  transformation  of  the  company  and  the acquisition  of  skills  in  addition  to  those  required  by  the current  post  through  large-scale  upskilling programmes; and\n- \u00b7 supporting and developing employees at each key stage of their career path.\n\n## Learning to secure essential skills\n\nL'Or\u00e9al equips all employees taking up new positions with JOB MUST  learning  programmes  that  enable  them  to  develop essential skills from  the  first few  weeks.  More  than 41,000 employees benefited from this in 2023.\n\nThe  Learning  Departments  of  the  Divisions  and  functions work closely with the Operational Departments to anticipate these critical skills and identify the most appropriate learning solutions.\n\nThe  Learning  Departments  in  the  various  Zones  play  a  key role  in  implementing  these  solutions.  Regional  campuses  are used  to  deploy  the  solutions  in  every  country,  and  the Learning Departments ensure that at least 80% of relevant employees take part in them at the appropriate time in their professional career.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These solutions were delivered  to  more  than  266,000  employees  Group-wide  in 2023 for all learning courses.\n\n## Providing an exceptional learning experience\n\nAfter the Covid-19 crisis, during which the remote format was preferred,  the  People  Development  &  Learning teams  have fully reinstated  the  face-to-face  learning  format,  which represents 56% of total learning activity. This makes it possible to  enhance inter-personal skills, which are an essential aspect of  certain  learning  courses  (onboarding, corporate  culture, managerial attitudes etc.).\n\nThis  new  mix  of  online  and  face-to-face  learning  offers greater opportunity for a high-quality learning experience, as it can be adapted to regional themes and contexts. The level of  the  learning  programmes  is  assessed  by  participants.  In 2023, they have given an impact score of 80/100 (1) .\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al University supports the Group's transformation\n\nThe  Group's  transformation  dynamic  is  underpinned  by  the learning  programmes  L'Or\u00e9al University  delivers  on  various issues:  CSR  strategy,  the  digital  revolution  that  impacts  all functions,  the  transformation  of  marketing,  the  acceleration of  e-commerce  and  changes  in  working  conditions  and managerial practices.\n\nOrganised around major areas of expertise (Leadership and Culture, E-Commerce, Tech Data & Analytics, Marketing and Retail), L'Or\u00e9al University's offerings are open  to  all employees, regardless of the business line or country in which they  work.  This  helps  to  form  a  common  vision  and  shared practices within the organisation.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al University of Leadership (2) and Culture supported the ' Simplicity 2 ' managerial change programme by designing and delivering a seminar for all Group employees to improve psychological safety and the effectiveness of meetings. More than 12,000 employees, including 150 management committees  have  taken  part  in  this  seminar  since  it  was launched in April 2023.\n\nAs an example of its certified excellence, in 2021 the L'Or\u00e9al University of Leadership  and  Culture  obtained  CLIP (3) accreditation  from  the  EFMD (4) ,  the  European  standard  for leading business schools.\n\nIn  April  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  its  University  of Retail,  the mission  of  which  is  to  design  and  coordinate  the  Group's learning offering for 25,000 employees or more (in-house and external)  who  work  in  the  retail  sales,  head  office  and  field segments: international teams, beauty advisors, trainers and designers.\n\nIn  2023,  as  part  of  its  environmental  commitments  and  its L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group launched Going Sustainable  Together,  a  priority  learning  programme  for  all employees. It addresses the impact of climate change on their working  lives  as  well  as  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  ecosystem.  This learning  programme  gives  employees  tools  they  can  use  to\n\nchange  their  behaviours  to  be  more  sustainable.  This  was delivered to more than 34,000 employees in 2023.\n\nIn order to continue to nurture the Group's ambition to be the market's  number  one Beauty  Tech,  the  University of Tech, Data  & Analytics  launched  the Data4All programme  in  the second half of 2022. This programme, which was followed by more  than  35,000  employees  in  2023,  aims  to  train participants in the main principles of working with data.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  University organised  the  first  ' L'Or\u00e9al  University Week ',  from  27  November  to  1  December  2023,  to  raise awareness  among  Group  employees  of  the  next  stages  of their  professional  development.  This  event  involved  each University leading an hour-long online session around the key issues related to its area of expertise and the implications of these in terms of skills. This first edition generated more than 7,700 live connections to the sessions.\n\n## A new experience in individual development\n\nIn  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  consolidated  its  performance  evaluation system with a process based on regular conversations, called CONNECT.\n\nThese  conversations  increase  agility  by  bringing  employees together  with  their  managers,  as  well  as  with  other  key stakeholders,  to  define  their  performance  and  development objectives.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  they  may  select  the most appropriate learning courses from over 20,000 available resources, developed by L'Or\u00e9al or by digital content providers such as LinkedIn Learning, TED, Coursera and Busuu.\n\n## 4.3.2.4. Creating conditions for a stimulating and attractive work environment\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme: an accelerator of social progress\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has always aimed to offer its employees security and protection.  The Share  &  Care programme  continues  a  long tradition of social progress and individual care. L'Or\u00e9al makes, and will  continue  to  make,  a  difference  by  putting  people  at the  centre  of  its  concerns,  its  organisation  and  therefore  its development.\n\nThe  Group  aspires  to  an  attractive  work  environment  that encourages  all  employees  to  thrive  professionally  and personally.\n\nWith its Share & Care programme, L'Or\u00e9al has made its social model universal in a manner that befits its global status. This strong commitment reflects the Group's vision that sustainable growth must go hand-in-hand with a high level of social performance. L'Or\u00e9al launched and implemented Share &  Care collaboratively  in  all  its  subsidiaries  in  2013,  and renewed the programme in 2017, 2021 and again in 2023. Its ambition is three-fold:\n\n- \u00b7 to  ensure  a  common  base  of  social  protection  with minimum guarantees in all subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 to be one of the most socially advanced employers in each market, and to adopt local best practice where that goes beyond the common base; and",

Mental and physical health receive special attention.\n\nEmployees  are  taught  about  their  'personal  ecology' (1) and provided with support for managing it. Prevention campaigns on  mental  health,  stress  management  and  psychological safety are in place in all subsidiaries. From 2023, in connection\n\nwith the worldwide Simplicity 2 programme, these campaigns have been routinely incorporated into annual recharge days. These arrangements form part of the action plans drawn up on the basis of the results of the Pulse engagement survey.\n\nFrom 2023, the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme includes a financial,  psychological  and  professional  support  policy  for employees with cancer. This policy, which also aims to lift the taboo surrounding this disease in the workplace, is gradually being rolled out to all subsidiaries.\n\n## The four pillars of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nThis social programme revolves around four pillars that have been implemented in all countries:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Pillars              | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                               | Main commitments achieved or in progress in all countries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PROTECTION           |                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| (Social protection)  | Providing employees and their  families with sufficient financial  support for unexpected life events.                                                                                   | 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension, in case of death. 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension, in case of total permanent disability.

A  close  partnership  has ensued. L'Or\u00e9al is a founding member of the Global Business Network for Social Protection Floor, which the ILO launched in 2015. This network allows firms to join forces to create a basic set of social protection measures for everyone.\n\n## Flexible work organisation\n\nWork  is  organised  according  to  the  location  and  activity  of each  subsidiary,  in  compliance  with  legal  and  contractual obligations. In several subsidiaries, both work organisation and working time are governed by collective agreements.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  flexibility  at  work  is  a  key  element  in attractiveness.  This  flexibility  is  strengthened  further  by  the global  'Hybrid  Working'  policy,  implemented  in  June  2020. Eligible  employees  may  work  remotely  for  up  to  two  days  a week,  on  a  voluntary  basis,  in  agreement  with  their  line manager and provided it fits with how the team is organised. All  Group  subsidiaries  have  adopted  this  policy.  In  addition, 59 subsidiaries have now set up a flexible working time policy.\n\nEmployees from all categories have chosen to work part-time. Of the 5,543 part-time employees in 2023, 89% were women\n\nIt should be noted (1) that L'Or\u00e9al provides five days' availability on  full  pay  for  employees  who  have  commitments  with  the French army reserves.\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al For All Generations programme\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  inclusion  of  more  experienced  employees (over 50 years of age), who represent 22.5% of the European workforce  and  15.2%  of  the  global  workforce,  is  a  longstanding  commitment.  As  careers  get  longer  and  the  digital transformation  accelerates,  the  Group  has  gone  one  step further  and  launched  the L'Or\u00e9al  For  All  Generations programme,  which  makes  intergenerational  relations  and employment  prospects  at  the  core  of  its  objectives.  The programme aims to create an attractive working environment, encouraging employees to flourish professionally and personally from the moment they join until they retire. It focuses on five key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting intergenerational inclusion, equity and diversity;\n- \u00b7 adapting health and wellness programmes;\n- \u00b7 developing career-long employability;\n- \u00b7 laying the groundwork for life after L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nLaunched  in  France  in  2022  and  inspired  by  the  Spanish Generaciones initiative,  this  programme  is  gradually  being rolled out internationally, particularly in Europe and the United States.\n\n## An active social dialogue with employees and their representatives\n\nAs  a  signatory  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  since 2003,  and  in  compliance  with  its  Employee  Human  Rights Policy, L'Or\u00e9al respects freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.\n\nWhen  employees  wish  to  be  represented  by  employee representatives,  these  representatives  are  elected  without company interference.  They  have  access  to  workplaces  and consenting employees, as well as to local documentation that can help them to perform their duties, subject to compliance with  the  Group's  rules  on  confidentiality  and  security.  In countries  where  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective bargaining are restricted or non-existent, there are other modes of dialogue that enable employees to report any concerns.\n\nIn the context of these general principles, the social climate at L'Or\u00e9al  is the fruit of an  ongoing  dialogue  between Management, employees and their representatives, respecting the rights of local trade unions and treating them all equally.\n\nEmployee  representation  bodies  are  in  place  in  most European  subsidiaries,  in  several  Asian  subsidiaries (2) , in Africa (3) ,  in  North  and  South  America (4) and  in  New  Zealand. In  total,  87%  of  the  Group's  employees  work  in  countries where there are  employee  representative  bodies  on  at  least one  site.  45%  of  the  Group's  employees  are  covered by  a  national  collective  agreement  and  97%  by  company collective agreements.\n\nTwo  Directors  representing  the  employees  have  been members  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Board  of  Directors  since  2014  (see paragraph 2.2.1.3.).\n\nIn  1996,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  an  agreement  with  the  French  and European trade unions, which led to the establishment of the European  Works  Council  ( Instance  Europ\u00e9enne  de  Dialogue Social ).  This  council  represents  more  than  31,000  employees in 25 member countries of the European Economic Area and the  United  Kingdom.  With  30  members,  this  council  holds regular  discussions  with  Management  about  the  Group's current situation  and  its  future  perspectives,  on  the  basis  of an agenda prepared with the Liaison Secretariat.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  social  policy  permits  the  signing  of  collective agreements every year. In 2023, 167 agreements were signed in  France and 78 agreements were signed in the rest of the world.  In  total,  the  number  of  agreements  in  force  on  31 December  2023  was  824,  466  of  which  were  in  France and 114 of which wholly or partially involve health and safety issues.  These  agreements  primarily  cover  work  organisation, compensation and working conditions (working hours, quality of life at work, professional equality, remote working, humanpowered mobility, health and safety etc.). They contribute to the  smooth  operation  and  performance  of  the  Group  by strengthening employee participation and dialogue with their representatives.\n\n- \u00b7 preparing for a successful transition to retirement; and",

Offering a motivating and competitive compensation system\n\n## The principles of the remuneration policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's remuneration policy is an integral part of the Group's development  strategy.  L'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  attract  and  retain talent, offer motivating career paths and encourage employee performance and engagement while supporting the evolution of its jobs and business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  all  employees  receive  at  least  the minimum  salary  set  by  local  law  or  the  applicable  collective agreements, and that they receive a living wage that covers their  basic  needs,  calculated  in  line  with  best  practices.  In 2023,  for  the  second  consecutive  year,  the  Group  was certified by the NGO Fair Wage Network as a 'Living Wage Employer' for  its  worldwide  workforce.  This  certification confirms  that  the  Group's  employees  are  paid  more  than  the living  wage  defined  each  year  and  for  each  country  by  this independent expert.\n\nA  total  rewards  approach  is  used  to  provide  each  employee with a competitive  rewards  package  that  includes  both components of remuneration and employee benefits.\n\nThe  Group  is  implementing  a  remuneration  policy  that combines  external  competitiveness  with  internal  equity.  This rewards both individual and collective performance. Employees share  in  the  Company's  results  through  collective  profitsharing schemes rolled out globally.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  remuneration  policy  is  formalised  within  a Rewards charter and is implemented by a worldwide network of  Rewards  experts.  External  surveys  are  conducted  every year  with  specialist  firms  to  ensure  L'Or\u00e9al's  competitive positioning in relation to each local reference market.\n\nThe ambition is  for  all  employees  to  clearly  and  transparently understand their remuneration and how it is determined.\n\nRemuneration  decisions  are  guided  by  an  annual  employee performance assessment system that is used in all subsidiaries. It enables the communication of remuneration decision making principles, processes and outcomes. The Group is implementing a new HR information system that will enhance and update communications on this subject.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Personnel costs (including welfare contributions)\n\n| \u20ac millions   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| TOTAL        | 6,471  | 7,264  | 7,796  |\n\nThis amount is calculated by applying accounting standards; it covers a broader scope than the scope for the consolidation of social data, as defined in paragraph 4.5.1.1.\n\n## Employee shareholding plans\n\nKeen to share its growth with its employees, L'Or\u00e9al launched its  first  worldwide  employee  share  ownership  plan  in  2018. The results were very satisfactory. L'Or\u00e9al wanted to provide eligible  employees  the  opportunity  to  support  the  growth  of the  company  and  participate  in  its  strategic  development by  launching  two  new  plans  in  2020  and  2022.  These  plans were  designed  to  gather,  unite  and  increase  the  loyalty  of employees  worldwide  by  enhancing  a  feeling  of  belonging, commitment and social cohesion.\n\nEligible  employees  had  the  possibility  of  purchasing  shares with  preferential  conditions  including,  where  permitted  by local  law,  a  20%  discount  on  the  share  reference  price,  with an  employer  matching  share  contribution  of  up  to  four  free shares.\n\nThe plan was rolled out in 62 countries in 2022, seven more than  in  2020.  It  was  a  big  success  with  a  35%  subscription rate,  similar  to  the  first  two  plans.  This  is  a  high  percentage compared  to  other  companies  that  have  set  up  employee shareholding plans (1) .\n\n## Plans for the conditional grant of shares to employees (ACAs)\n\nL'Or\u00e9al sets up long-term incentive plans for its international senior managers and corporate officers. These take the form of  grants  of  performance  shares.  These  grants  serve  a  dual purpose: to motivate and include the major contributors in the Group's future successes, and to strengthen the commitment and feeling of belonging of its beneficiaries by fostering longterm loyalty in a context of increased competition for talent.\n\nAccording  to  the  Group's  strategic  objectives,  the  choice  of beneficiaries and the vesting criteria are settled in a specific policy. The Board of Directors, subject to the recommendation of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee, approves the conditional grant of shares and lays down the applicable rules. The vesting of these shares is subject to the achievement  of  performance  targets  and  the  beneficiary's continued presence in the Company. Performance conditions include both financial and non-financial performance criteria (see section 5.4.).\n\n54%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  12  October  2023  plan  are women. More than 3,600 employees, representing approximately 8% of the managers around the world, nearly 54% of whom are in international subsidiaries, benefit or have benefited from at least one conditional grant of shares plan since  2019  and  were  still  employees  of  the  Company  on  31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Local  talents  who  are  not  yet eligible  to  the  employee  share  plans  are  the  targets  of  this plan,  which  takes  the  form  of  a  deferred  bonus  over  three years.  The  scheme  is  implemented  and  managed  at  country level, based on a Group-wide guideline. More than 2,300  employees  in  more  than  50  countries  are  now beneficiaries of this scheme.\n\n## Profit sharing schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  wishes  to  include  employees  in  the  results  of  the Company  to  enhance  their  feeling  of  belonging  and motivation. In 2023, on the basis of its 2022 results, the Group redistributed  \u20ac461  million  to  employees  under  the profitsharing  schemes  in  place.  The  first  profit-sharing  schemes were  introduced  in  France  in  1968  when  a  Group  profitsharing  agreement  ('participation')  was  signed  in  France, followed by another Group incentive agreement ('int\u00e9ressement')  in  1988,  and  these  agreements  have  been constantly  renewed  since  then. Since  2001,  L'Or\u00e9al  has implemented a Worldwide Profit Sharing Programme in all the Group's  subsidiaries  in  which  the  employees  do  not  benefit from  legal  or  contractual  profit  sharing  schemes.  The amounts paid within this framework are calculated locally on the  basis  of  the  turnover  and  profit  of  each  subsidiary,  as compared to the budgeted targets.\n\n| Amounts paid under these  programmes  (\u20ac millions)   |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| TOTAL (1)                                            |    352 |    418 |    461 |\n\n## Employee benefit and pension schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  ensures  that  its  employees  benefit  from  competitive retirement and  death/disability insurance plans in all countries.  Since  2002,  an  International  Benefits  Supervisory Committee  has  overviewed  the  management  of  these schemes in the subsidiaries and monitored the implementation of L'Or\u00e9al's Retirement and Employee Benefits policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  with  regard  to  welfare  schemes  are part  of  the  Protection  pillar  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al Share  &  Care programme.  In  all  subsidiaries,  L'Or\u00e9al  guarantees  the payment  of  a  lump  sum,  or  equivalent  pension,  equal  to  a minimum of 24 months' salary in the event of death or total permanent disability, or a higher amount where it is the local practice.\n\nThe characteristics  of  retirement  schemes  and  other  end  of career benefits offered by the subsidiaries vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations as well as local practices.\n\nIn  89%  of  the  countries  where  L'Or\u00e9al  employees  work,  the Group contributes to the build-up of supplemental retirement benefits for its employees in addition to the minimum benefits of the public social security system.\n\nRetirement  plans  are  financed  by  payments  into  specialised funds,  or  by  setting  up  provisions,  in  accordance  with  the accounting standards adopted by L'Or\u00e9al. The performance of the  managers  of  the  main  investment  funds,  as  well  as  the financial  stability  rating  of  the  custodians,  are  regularly reviewed by the International Benefits Supervisory Committee.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  does  not  offer  company  retirement  plans  in  countries that do not have an appropriate legal framework, or long-term investment  instruments,  and  in  countries  where  there  is  a\n\nsatisfactory  public  social  security  system.  The  International Benefits Supervisory Committee remains attentive to changes to local situations and, when needed, additional complementary schemes are put in place.\n\n## Overview of the pension and employee welfare schemes in France\n\nPension schemes : To supplement the pensions provided for by the compulsory  French  pension  scheme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented some supplementary pension schemes described below.\n\nDefined  contribution  schemes: L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a  'defined contribution pension scheme'. After one year of employment, all  categories  of  employees  are  beneficiaries  of  this  scheme, which  is  financed  jointly  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employee.  This makes it possible for everyone to build up retirement savings. This scheme entitles pensioners to a life annuity (or to a lumpsum,  under  certain  conditions),  calculated  after  they  claim their pension rights under the Social Security pension system. This annuity is calculated on the basis of the capital formed by the  contributions  paid  and  the  financial  income  on  such contributions at the end of the employee's career, as well as the annuity option selected. On 1 April 2021, the scheme was converted  into  a  Mandatory  Company  Savings  Plan  (Plan d'\u00c9pargne Retraite Obligatoire - PERO) within the framework laid  down by the French Pacte law (Loi Pacte). This made it possible to introduce many improvements to the scheme, such as  new  options  for  paying  into  it,  more  diversified  financial investments and more flexible exit conditions.\n\nDefined benefit schemes: L'Or\u00e9al has set up several defined benefit schemes with unvested entitlements, that were initially differential  and  then  additive.  The  aim  was  to  take  into account  important  developments  impacting  these  schemes, with  the  aim  of  building  a  coherent  system  between  the different pension schemes that exist in the Company.\n\nFrench Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 (1) no longer allows the  acquisition  of  unvested  new  rights  in  schemes  open  on 20  May  2014  for  employment  periods  after  31  December 2019. In this context, L'Or\u00e9al froze the rights at 31 December 2019.  In  2021,  the  Group  finalised  the  establishment  of  two substitution schemes with vested rights (2) : the 'Supplementary pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior  Managers  with  vested rights' (Retraite suppl\u00e9mentaire des Retrait\u00e9s Anciens Cadres Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis)  and  the  'Retirement  Income Guarantee  for  former  senior  managers  with  vested  rights' (Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis).  These  schemes  are  considered as  the  continuations  of  the  old  schemes  because  of  the consistency in terms of population and benefits.\n\nThe  'Supplementary  pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior Managers'  concerns  retirees  who  have  held  positions  as senior managers for a minimum of 10 years, hired or promoted to this position between 1 January 2016 and 4 July 2019, who end their career in the Company. This is an additive defined benefit pension scheme which grants entitlement to payment of  a  life  annuity.  The  reference  salary  used  to  calculate  the pension is the fraction of the salary which exceeds six times the French annual Social Security ceiling. The calculation base of the supplementary pension is the average of the revalued reference salaries for the best three full years of activity out of  the  seven  calendar  years  prior  to  the  end  of  their  career. The  supplementary  pension  is  1.36%  of  the  calculation  base per year of service within the Group until 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. Any retiree who so wishes could elect an option of a surviving spouse pension.",

        "page_content": "Access  to  the  'Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  former senior managers'  was  closed  on  31  December  2015. This scheme, created on 1 January 2001, was open to former senior  managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  who,  in  addition  to  fulfilling  the requirement of having ended their career with the Company, met  the  condition  of  holding  senior  manager  status  for  at least ten years at the end of their career. It entitles beneficiary retirees  to  payment  of  a  life  annuity,  and  to  payment,  after their death and subject to conditions, to their spouse and/or ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving  spouse  pension  and,  to  the children,  of  an  orphan  pension.  The  calculation  base  is  the average  of  the  salaries  for  the  best  three  years  out  of  the seven calendar years prior to the end of the senior manager's career at L'Or\u00e9al. The income guarantee is calculated on the basis  of  the  number  of  years  of  professional  service  in  the Company up to 31 December 2019, up to a limit of 25 years. The amount of the Guarantee is progressively and regularly increased by 1.8% each year. The pension cannot exceed 50% of  the  calculation  base  or  exceed  the  average  of  the  fixed part  of  the  salaries.  A  gross  annuity  and  gross  lump  sum equivalent are then calculated, taking into account the sum of the  annual  pensions  accrued  by  beneficiaries  as  a  result  of their professional activity and assuming that their retirement age is 65. The life annuity is the result of the conversion into an annuity at the beneficiaries'  actual  age  on  the  date  they apply for their pension of the gross lump sum equivalent, less the amount of all payments due as a result of termination of the  employment  contract,  excluding  any  paid  notice  period and  paid  holiday,  and  less  all  salaries  paid  under  any  early retirement leave. Around 330 senior managers are eligible for these  schemes  if  they  fulfil  all  conditions  after  ending  their career with the Company.\n\nAccess to the 'Pension Cover for Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' (Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de  Conjoncture)  was  closed  on  31  December  2000.  This former  scheme  granted  entitlement,  to  beneficiary  retirees who ended their career with the Company, of a life annuity as well  as,  after  their  death,  the  payment  under  certain conditions  to  the  spouse  and/or  ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving spouse pension and, to the children, of an orphan pension. The calculation base for the Pension Cover is the average of the salaries  for  the  best  three  years  out  of  the  seven  calendar years prior to the end of the beneficiary's career at L'Or\u00e9al. The  Pension  Cover  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the beneficiary's  number  of  years'  service,  with  a  ceiling  of 40 years, it being specified that at the date of closure of the scheme, on 31 December 2000, the minimum length of service required  was  10  years.  The  Pension  Cover  may  not  exceed 40% of the calculation base, plus 0.5% per year for the first twenty years, then 1% per year for the following twenty years, nor  exceed  the  average  of  the  fixed  part  of  the  salaries. Around 120 senior managers (active or retired) are eligible for this  scheme  subject  to  the  requirement,  for  those  in  active employment,  that  they  fulfil  all  the  conditions  after  having ended their career with the Company.\n\nOn  1 January  2023,  the Collective  Retirement  Savings  Plan (PERCO) was converted into a company collective retirement savings  plan  (PER  COL)  in  accordance  with  the  Pacte  law. Since 2003, L'Or\u00e9al has offered employees an opportunity to build  retirement  savings  under  the  PER  COL.  If  the  profit sharing  is  placed  in  the  PER  COL,  a  100%  matching contribution is paid by the Company on the first \u20ac1,200 gross and 50% thereafter (capped at \u20ac4,600/year total PER COL employer contributions). For employees who pay 100% of their profit sharing into the PER COL for five consecutive years, an employer  contribution  of  \u20ac600  gross  is  paid  into  the  PER COL  (Club  PER  COL)  in  the  fifth  year.  Since  2021,  an\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nadditional employer contribution of \u20ac150 gross has been paid from  the  sixth  consecutive  year  in  which  100%  of  the  profit sharing  has  been  invested  into  the  PER  COL.  Each  year, employees  may  also  transfer  10  days  of  saved  leave  time (Compte  \u00c9pargne  Temps  -  CET)  in  the  PER  COL.  An additional  employer  contribution  of  20%  is  paid  for  these days.\n\nPre-retirement  arrangements: L'Or\u00e9al  pays  close  attention to its employees' retirement conditions. The existing arrangements are, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 early  retirement  leave  (cong\u00e9  de  fin  de  carri\u00e8re  -  CFC):  this early retirement arrangement consists of exempting employees  from  the  requirement  to  perform  their  activities, while  maintaining  their  compensation  (up  to  a  limit  of \u20ac11,279  gross/month);  profit  sharing;  incentives;  and  paid leave.  The  CFC may range from three months for 20 years' seniority to nine months for 30 years' seniority and more; and\n- \u00b7 retirement compensation (indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite -  IDR):  the  scale  set  by  collective  agreement  is  more favourable than that of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for  the  Chemical  Industries.  When  they  retire, employees  may  benefit  from  retirement  indemnities ranging from two months' salary for five years' service to eight months' salary for 40 years of service.\n\nIn  order  to  increase  the  special  leave  prior  to  retirement, employees may opt to convert all or part of their retirement indemnities into time, or may choose to receive payment of all or  part  of  the  retirement  indemnities,  which  will  be  made at the time they leave the Company. These commitments are guaranteed  by  external  financial  cover  aimed  at  gradually building  up  funds  derived  from  premiums  paid  to  external organisations.\n\n- \u00b7 the Time Savings Account (Compte \u00c9pargne Temps - CET): this optional scheme enables employees to plan the end of their career or increase their retirement income. Employees can bank up to 10 days of untaken leave per year in the CET, five days of which attract an employer contribution of 25% and/or  a  cash  payment,  up  to  a  maximum  of  8%  of  gross remuneration per year. This scheme is capped at 300 days.\n\nThe  CET  can  finance  a  shift  to  part-time  working  from  the age  of  55,  early  retirement,  increased  retirement  income, providing a retirement lump-sum (1) ,  by  taking  the  opportunity to  transfer  a  maximum  of  10  days  per  year  to  the  defined contribution scheme or the L'Or\u00e9al PER COL (2) .\n\nFor  more  than  40  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  provided  employees aged  55  and  older  with  the  opportunity  to  take  part  in  a three-day seminar, 'Retirement: switching to a new life plan'. A  new  learning  course  entitled  'My  retirement  savings solutions' is also available to employees over 40 years of age.\n\nEmployee  benefit  schemes  in  France : In  addition  to  the compulsory  guarantees  provided  for  by  the  collective bargaining agreements, L'Or\u00e9al has set up, in France, under an agreement, an employee benefit scheme providing  additional  collective  guarantees  to  its  employees. All  these  guarantees  are  based  on  gross  income  and  can total  up  to  eight  times  the  French  annual  social  security ceiling. They are generally financed on Brackets A, B, and C of income,  except  for  the  Education  Annuity  which  is  based  on Brackets A and B, and the Surviving Spouse Pension which is based  on  Brackets  B  and  C.  This  employee  benefit  scheme provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 incapacity: to all employees, 90% of their gross remuneration limited to eight social security caps, at this level net of charges, after the first 90 days of work stoppage;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount of this Benefit is doubled in the event of accidental death;\n- \u00b7 for  the  employees  affiliated  with  the  benefit  scheme for  managers,  employees  governed  by  Article  36  of the  AGIRC  convention  and  sales  representatives,  the payment  of  a  Spouse  Pension  to  the  surviving  spouse. This  ensures  that  the  spouse  has  an  income  similar  to the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  paid  for  supplementary retirement contributions on the portion of remuneration greater  than  the  annual  cap  on  social  security  if  death had occurred at the age of 65; and\n- \u00b7 for all employees, the payment of an Education Annuity to  each  dependent  child,  according  to  an  age-based schedule.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  Lump  Sum  Equivalent  for  these guarantees may not exceed \u20ac2.3 million per event.\n\nMinimum guaranteed lump sum death benefits: L'Or\u00e9al  has established  an  additional  guaranteed  Lump  Sum  Death Benefit that supplements, where applicable, for all employees, the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefit  in  an  amount  equal  to  three years'  average  income.  The  total  amount  of  the  risk  capital needed to fund the Surviving Spouse Pension and Education Annuity,  the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefits  and  the  minimum guaranteed Lump Sum Death Benefit is capped.\n\nHealthcare  expenses: the  healthcare  scheme  is  compulsory for  all  the  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its  French  subsidiaries. Employees have the option of including their family members in  these  schemes.  Contributions  are,  generally,  individual. The employee contribution is partly financed by the Company.\n\n## 4.3.2.6. Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nDiversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  are  part  of  the  strategic commitments  of  the  Group,  which  aims  to  have  teams  that reflect the diversity of its consumers worldwide and to provide all employees  with  an  equitable  and  inclusive  working environment.  The  Group  also  adopts  an  inclusive  approach towards communities, suppliers and stakeholders. The Group's DE&I strategy is structured around four key pillars:\n\n- 1. Increase socio-economic  and  multicultural diversity: promote  and  increase  socio-economic  and  multicultural diversity in the Group's teams;\n- 2. Physical,  mental  and  social  well-being: accelerate  the inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities,  by  addressing  both visible  and  invisible  disabilities,  mental  health,  chronic illnesses and neurodiversity, with a minimum target for the number of employees with disabilities in all countries;\n- 3. Age  and  Generations: value  and  take  into  consideration people  of  all  ages  and  generations;  encourage  dialogue and cooperation among employees of different generations; combat stereotypes based on age; and\n\n- 4. Gender  and  LGBTQIA+ (1) : achieve  gender  parity  at  all levels  and  functions  of  the  company;  contribute  to  the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the  LGBTQIA+  communities  worldwide;  act  against  any type of harassment or violence, particularly sexism, sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\n\nThe  Group's  DE&I  policy  is  also  reflected  in  its  approach towards its suppliers (see paragraph 4.3.3.6.), its consumers, partners,  communities  and  the  NGOs  and  associations dedicated to inclusion in all Zones.\n\nTo  achieve  its  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  relies  particularly  on  an internal  network  of  'DE&I  Leads'  within  countries,  functions and Divisions. They ensure the implementation of the Group's DE&I  policy,  which  they  adapt  to  their  local  context.  The Group  shares  its  achievements  and  progress  in  a  dedicated section on the loreal.com website.\n\nTo  measure  employees'  perception  of  DE&I,  'Pulse',  the annual  in-house  survey  on  employee  engagement,  includes questions on this issue. In 2023, L'Or\u00e9al also included optional 'self-identification' (Self-ID) questions in the Pulse survey for the  first  time,  providing employees  with  the  opportunity  to share information about their identity in complete anonymity. Analysis of the responses enables the Group to reinforce the fight against discrimination, to assess the effectiveness of the Group's  global  DE&I  actions  and  to  better  understand  the diversity  of  its  teams.  67%  of  employees  answered  the  selfidentification  questions  in  the  countries  where  it  was  legally possible  to  include  these  questions  in  the Pulse  survey.  This represents more than 47,000 employees within the Group.\n\nIn advertising and  marketing  its  products,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed to communicating responsibly by ensuring that it respects the diversity of beauty needs and desires around the world. In its  Code of Ethics, the Group commits not to harm the dignity of human beings or present degrading stereotypes in  its  advertising.  It  is  also  sensitive  to  possible  reactions  to the  Group's  advertising  from  different  religious,  ethnic, cultural or social groups.\n\nTo  strengthen  its  commitment  to  more  inclusive  marketing and advertising, L'Or\u00e9al joined the Unstereotype Alliance (2) in 2021. As a member of the World Federation of Advertisers (3) , in 2022 L'Or\u00e9al contributed to the publication of a Charter for Change, which aims to drive  progress  on  DE&I  issues  within the advertising industry.\n\nLaunched  in  2021,  the  Global  DE&I  Advisory  Board  brings together a diverse group of external experts and leaders from within  the  Group.  The  Board  is  co-chaired  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Global  Chief  DE&I  Officer.  It  met twice in 2023, and local boards also met in North America and the United Kingdom & Ireland.\n\nIn  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  the  second  Beauty  of  Inclusion Awards, a competition to recognise the best DE&I initiatives led  by  local  teams.  The  projects  come  from  all  Zones  and Divisions,  as  well  as  functions  and  brands,  and  reflect L'Or\u00e9al's commitment in all four pillars of the DE&I strategy. The final of the second edition of this competition is scheduled for 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Reinforcing multicultural and socio-economic diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's goal is to reflect, at all levels and in all functions, the diversity  of  the  markets  in  which  it  operates.  Particular attention is therefore paid to the diversification of recruitment pools,  to  ensure  equal  opportunities  in  terms  of  professional development,  and  to  raise  awareness  of  employees  and management  on  this  subject.  Under  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth programme, the Group is committed to diversifying its sources of  recruitment,  with  the  aim  of  recruiting  at  least  20%  of the  talent  for  the Management  Trainee  Programme from non-partner schools and universities.\n\n167: number of nationalities (in the global workforce) among the 64 countries (1)\n\nSince 2015, L'Or\u00e9al has supported the ENAR's (2) Equal@Work initiative,  which  helps  to  ensure  progress  on  this  important issue.\n\nSince 2019, L'Or\u00e9al has been an active member of the Tent Partnership  for  Refugees,  a  global  network  of  more  than 350  companies  that  supports  refugees.  This  partnership enables  L'Or\u00e9al  to  strengthen  the  socio-economic  and multicultural  diversity  of  its  teams,  offer  job  opportunities  to the candidates in question and facilitate their inclusion in their host countries. In Europe, L'Or\u00e9al participates in a mentoring programme for female refugees and also committed in 2023 to recruiting 50 refugees over three years. L'Or\u00e9al has signed the Charter on the inclusion of refugees and exiled people in the workplace, drafted by SINGA and Utopies, as part of its commitment to professional integration and the fight against the underemployment of refugees. In 2023, alongside SINGA, the  Group  organised  workshops  and  roundtables  to  raise awareness about inter-cultural issues and challenge stereotypes  regarding  refugees  for  an  audience  of  internal parties  (DE&I  Leads)  and  external  parties  (students  from universities and partner schools).\n\n## Promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities and the physical, mental and social well-being of all employees\n\nFor more than 20 years, L'Or\u00e9al has applied a global policy to include people with disabilities within the Group. In 2023, the Group employed 1,701 statutory employees with disabilities, i.e. 1.9% of the total workforce. The goal is 2% by 2025.\n\nThe priorities of this policy focus on five areas:\n\n- \u00b7 recruitment:  promoting  the  recruitment  of  people  with disabilities in all countries;\n- \u00b7 retention:  supporting  employees  who  have  experienced accidents, illness or the worsening of an existing disability;\n- \u00b7 employee  awareness:  conducting  internal  communications campaigns and learning initiatives to promote an inclusive working environment and create conditions that encourage employees to declare their disability, so that the company can adapt workstations, jobs and support;\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n- \u00b7 accessibility:  promoting  the  accessibility  of  premises  and digital accessibility for employees and consumers; and\n- \u00b7 partnerships and sharing best practices: collaboration with recognised experts, associations and NGOs on the subject, as  well  as  with  the  protected  and  disability-adapted  work sector is an important element in advancing inclusion.\n\nAn active member of the ILO since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the  first  signatories  of  the  Global  Business  and  Disability Network  Charter  in  2015  and  chaired  the  network  in  2021. Since 2020, L'Or\u00e9al has been a member of the Valuable 500, a  global  collective  of  500  companies,  whose  objective  is to  promote  the  inclusion  of  people  with  a  disability.  L'Or\u00e9al was one of the first companies to join Generation Valuable, a programme  launched  in  2022  by  the  Valuable  500.  This programme  aims  to  support  an  employee  with  a  disability through a specific training programme and mentoring with a member of the Executive Committee, so as to raise disability awareness at the highest level of the business.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  support  the  Disability  Hub  Europe initiative,  which  brings  together  various  stakeholders  in  the field of disability and sustainability.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  strengthening  its  commitment  to  greater  inclusion in sport by supporting a group of 10 athletes with disabilities.\n\n## Valuing and taking into consideration people of all ages and generations\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  ensures  that  every  employee  has  their  place  in  the company, regardless of their age or experience. Accordingly, in continuation of the Spanish Generaciones initiative and the French inter-company commitment to enhance the role in the company  of  those  over  age  50,  the  Group  launched  the L'Or\u00e9al For  All Generations programme,  which  places intergenerational relations and employability at the core of its objectives (3) . Initially launched  in  France  in  2022,  this programme is gradually being rolled out internationally.\n\n## Gender equity: professional parity and equality for women and men\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  most  strategic positions,  is  a  key  challenge  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  aim  is  to strengthen  the  Group's  ability  to  innovate  while  promoting a  culture  of  inclusion.  The  Group  ensures  that  all  jobs  are accessible to women and men, both at the recruitment level and  with  regard  to  opportunities  for  career  development. Special  attention  is  given  to  pivotal  periods  such  as parenthood (see paragraph 4.3.2.4.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

General Management reports annually to the Board of Directors on this policy and the results obtained during the previous financial year. From 2022,  the  long-term  compensation  plans  include  both  nonfinancial  and  financial  performance  criteria,  including  a criterion linked to gender balance in strategic positions.\n\nSince  March  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  published  its  'Index  of Professional  Gender  Equality',  which  is  calculated  using  five indicators defined by the 'Professional Future' law. This 2024 Group Index (2023 data) is at 97% for all of L'Or\u00e9al's French entities.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  collaborated  with  the  French National  Institute  for  Demographic  Studies  (Institut  national d'\u00e9tudes  d\u00e9mographiques  -  INED)  to  conduct  an  annual analysis  of  the  differences  in  remuneration  between  women and men working in France. The aim is to  ensure  equal  pay among those with the same skill level and classification. The median pay gap in France decreased from 10% in 2007 to 0% in  2019  (stable  in  2020,  2021  and  2022)  and  the  mean  pay gap in France also fell during this period, from 31% in 2007 to 7% in 2022 (10% including the Executive Committee) (1) .\n\nIn addition to the analysis in France, in 2020 L'Or\u00e9al launched a global  tool  to  measure  gender  pay  equality  'all  other  things being  equal'  (net  of  structural  effects),  based  on  EDGE methodology, which uses a tolerance threshold of +/-5% (2) . The analysis  was  extended  to  39  countries/regions (3) in  2023, representing more  than  90%  of  the  global  workforce (compared to 32 countries/regions in 2022). According to this analysis,  the  adjusted  average  salary  gap  in  these  countries/ regions is 0.71% in favour of men.\n\nMeasuring the gender pay gap is key to enable the Group to identify  any  potential  challenges  and  implement  targeted actions. L'Or\u00e9al aims to expand the scope of this analysis to all the  countries  in  which  the  Group  has  more  than 150  employees  by  2025 (4) .  In  addition,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  deploying  a Gender  Pay  module  in  the  HR  information  system  so  that countries/regions  can  monitor,  analyse  and  improve  their gender  pay  statistics.  Structural  effects  are  also  addressed within a framework of equitable and inclusive HR policies.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al and gender balance\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, women account for:\n\n- \u00b7 68% of the total workforce;\n- \u00b7 51% of expatriates in place;\n- \u00b7 70% of employees promoted;\n- \u00b7 62% of international brand directors;\n- \u00b7 52% of all key positions within L'Or\u00e9al S.A. (5) ;\n- \u00b7 57% of all key positions within the Group (6) including:\n- \u00b7 48% of strategic positions (7) ;\n- \u00b7 54% of key positions monitored at Group level;\n- \u00b7 58% of key positions monitored at local/regional level;\n- \u00b7 32% of Executive Committee members; and\n- \u00b7 50% of members of the Board of Directors (8) .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has chosen to have its gender equality practices and policies  audited  and relies  on  two  independent organisations to measure and assess the situation of its subsidiaries: Gender Equality  European  &  International  Standard  (GEEIS)  and Equity,  Diversity  and  Gender  Equality  certification  (EDGE). The  Group's  head  office  in  France  and  27  of  its  countries (9) have  been  awarded  the  GEEIS  label  ,  and  are  audited  every two years by Bureau Veritas to measure the progress achieved.\n\nEight other countries (10) currently rely on the EDGE certification process. The countries are audited by the thirdparty organisations Flocert or Intertek in order to be certified. L'Or\u00e9al USA has achieved EDGE Plus status, which provides an  additional  analysis  of  intersectional  equity  (LGBTQIA+, age, ethnicity, disability and nationality).\n\nIn  total,  35  countries  held  EDGE  or  GEEIS  certifications in  2023 \u2611 ,  which  represents  more  than  60%  of  the  Group's workforce.\n\nIn  2023,  an  initiative  from  L'Or\u00e9al  Brazil  was  awarded  a GEEIS-SDG  trophy  in  the  fourth  edition  of  the  awards, organised by Arborus with the cooperation of the Representation  in  France  of  the  European  Commission  and the  United  Nations  agencies  responsible  for  monitoring  the Sustainable Development Goals.",

        "page_content": "In another area, L'Or\u00e9al has conducted a pioneering initiative designed to promote gender equality in the legal profession. A Charter was created for this purpose in 2020, with the aim of sharing with our principal law firms common principles, values and measures with regard to gender equality. 14 firms have signed  this  Charter,  which  supplements  actions  taken  in  this area  by  the  firms  themselves.  The  ambition  is  to  build  and maintain  an  exemplary  relationship,  enabling  everyone  to benefit from equal opportunities and better balance.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al is committed to combating gender-based violence\n\nIn  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  the  first  company  to  join  the One  in Three  Women  network,  the  first  European  network  of companies committed to fighting violence against women (1) . Its aim  is  to  create  and  test  measures  to  combat  violence against  women  and  to  support  the  employees  concerned, through  specialised  NGOs.  Working  with  this  network, concrete action has been taken, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the  provision  of  online  learning  courses  (translated  into 7  languages)  to  raise  employee  awareness  of  violence against women;\n- \u00b7 the  launch  of  awareness-raising  campaigns  to  mark  the International  Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Violence  against Women.\n\nAfter having committed to support the ILO's adoption of the first international convention against violence and harassment  in  the  workplace  in  2019  along  with  the  NGO CARE, L'Or\u00e9al established a global HR policy on combatting domestic  violence.  This  global  policy  was  launched  in  March 2021  as  part  of  the Share  &  Care programme  and  local policies  are  currently  being  rolled  out  within  the  Group's subsidiaries.\n\nIn  2018,  the  #StOpE  initiative  against  so-called  'ordinary' sexism in  the  workplace,  led  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  teams  in  France with Accor  and  EY,  brought  together  30  companies and  organisations.  They  signed  a  commitment  under  the patronage  of  the  French  Minister  for  Gender  Equality and  the  Fight  Against  Discrimination.  At  the  end  of  2023, more than 190 organisations were involved with this initiative, which aims to promote best practices to combat sexism in the workplace. This initiative is deployed globally within the Group. Online  learning  has  been  developed  collaboratively  by  7  of the companies in the network.\n\n## Contributing to the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the LGBTQIA+ communities\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nIn  2021,  a  minimum  of  6  weeks'  fully  paid  paternity  or  coparenting  leave  was  incorporated  into  the  global Share  & Care programme. Some countries have extended the length of this leave, for example 8 weeks' leave is available in France and 16 weeks in the United States.\n\nThe  Employee  Human  Rights  Policy  sets  out  the  Group's commitment  to  combating  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\n## Training employees in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nIn order  to  support  these  initiatives,  L'Or\u00e9al  trains  its employees in DE&I by organising Diversity Learning Workshops. These courses are now available virtually. In 2023, more  than  11,000  employees  were  trained  through  these workshops.\n\nSince 2010, L'Or\u00e9al has participated in the EVE programme, an initiative led by the Danone Group, aimed to help women to be  agents  of  change  in  their  company  and  to  develop  their leadership  and  careers.  Editions  of  this  programme  were launched  in  Asia  in  2014  (EVE  Asia-Pacific)  and  in  Africa  in 2017  (EVE  Africa).  More  than  900  Group  employees  have taken part in this programme since it was launched.\n\nNumerous  DE&I  learning  resources  are  available  on  the Group's internal learning platform. In 2023, the Group made available  14  online  learning  programmes  on  DE&I  topics (3) , as  well  as  a  selection  of  podcasts.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  supports Octave, an intergenerational leadership programme launched more than 10 years ago by Danone.\n\nIn 2022, L'Or\u00e9al launched an in-house learning programme on inclusive leadership within the Consumer Products Division. In 2023, this programme was launched across all of the Group's Divisions and its rollout will continue in 2024.\n\n## Awards obtained in 2023\n\nFor  the  sixth  consecutive  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  by Bloomberg's  Gender-Equality  Index  2023  (GEI) (4) for  its commitments  to  female  leadership,  talent  management, gender equality, inclusion and policies on sexual harassment.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al was ranked third in the Refinitiv (5) Diversity & Inclusion Index  2023  and  was  therefore  included  among  the  top 100  companies  for  diversity  and  inclusion  for  the  eighth consecutive year.\n\nFor the sixth consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the top 20 most  advanced  companies  in  the  world  in  terms  of  gender equality,  according  to  the  Equileap  Global  Gender-Equality Ranking 2023 (6) , ranking No. 1 in France.\n\nWith  a  presence  in  all  Zones,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  contributing  to  the establishment  of  more  inclusive  environments  in  favour  of people  identifying  as  LGBTQIA+ (2) .  Since  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has been  one  of  the  sponsors  of  the  'Standards  of  Conduct for Business'  established  by  the  United  Nations  High Commissioner  for  Human  Rights  in  the  fight  against discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A commitment of the entire organisation\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment to human rights is based in particular on  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  United Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights, and  the  Fundamental  Conventions  of  the  International Labour Organization.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, a member of the Executive  Committee,  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the respect  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  in  the Group.  This  mission  has  been  entrusted  to  her  by  L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports. She chairs the Group's Human Rights Committee. She relies on a dedicated team of human rights experts and has a budget to carry out her work.\n\nThe Group's human rights commitments are rolled out across all markets through a network of Human Rights Correspondents.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Human  Rights Committee is composed of representatives  from  the  various  Zones,  activities  and departments (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security etc.).  It  is  responsible  for  coordination  and  exchange  on  the implementation of the Group's human rights policy. Its primary objective  is  to  facilitate  the  emergence  of  a  human  rights culture within the Group.\n\nIn  order  to  best  address  the  human  rights  issues  that  relate to  its  operational  activities  and  commercial  relationships, L'Or\u00e9al  has  structured  its  human  rights  policy  around  the most salient human rights risks across its whole value chain.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve  its  human  rights  goals  and  deal  with identified  risks,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  member  of  the  United Nations  Global  Compact  since  2003,  and  is  committed  to respecting all internationally recognised human  rights.

As at 31 December 2023, 66% of the relevant employees had already completed it. |\n\n## 4.3.3.2. L'Or\u00e9al's commitment to protecting personal data\n\nThe  Group  attaches  great  importance  to  the  principle  of transparency and aims to establish a relationship of trust with its stakeholders. It ensures that its responsible use of personal data  is  underpinned  by  the  protection  and  security  of  that data.\n\nIn  support  of  this  ambition,  the  Group's  principles  governing the  processing  of  personal  data (Data  Privacy)  have  been shared  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees  about  respect  for  ethical  principles  and  the  legal and regulatory requirements in this area. These principles are supplemented  by  a  framework  of  policies,  procedures  and operational guidelines.\n\nThe  Group  has  put  in  place  a  structure  based  on  a  Data Privacy Office (Global DPO Office), which consists of a Legal unit and a Programme unit. A Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) was appointed in 2018 and a network of Country DPOs has  been  set  up  worldwide  and  is  growing  in  strength  (47 DPOs  in  2023).  This  structure  also  relies  on  a  network  of Personal Data Protection Officers in each region and in each business  area  (IT,  Digital,  Marketing,  HR,  Research  & Innovation,  Retail, Operations  etc.).  They  are  responsible  for rolling  out  personal data protection policies that are tailored to the challenges and specific features of their fields.\n\nA  Global  Strategic  Data Privacy  Committee  was  set  up  to establish  strategic  guidelines  and  ensure  the  personal  data protection  programme is rolled  out.  Led  by  the  Group  DPO, this Committee is composed specifically of the Chief Financial Officer,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer,  the Group  General  Counsel  and  the  Chief  Information  Officer. For  the  sake  of  consistency  and  operational  efficiency,  a Steering Committee is in place for each Zone.\n\nThis governance  ensures  the  Group's  compliance  with different  laws,  such  as  the  GDPR  in  Europe,  the CCPA  in California, the LGPD in Brazil, the PIPL in China or the POPI Act  in  South  Africa.  It  ensures  stakeholder  involvement  and that  client,  supplier  and  business  processes  are  adapted  to applicable local laws.\n\nIn  order  to  comply  with  European  rules,  the  Group  has established a record of data processing performed in Europe. This tool is also offered in countries not subject to the GDPR that wish to use it.\n\nIn  support  of  the  privacy  by  design  principle,  the  Group  has rolled  out  a  digitalised  tool  that  is  available  to  operational staff.  This  tool  helps  them  to  ensure  that  a  project  complies with operational principles and rules relating to personal data protection from the very start and to carry out the required privacy impact assessments.\n\nAll employees  within the Group  have  access  to  an awareness-raising programme on the protection of personal data. Specific learning programmes are available for the main functions.  An  Intranet  site  dedicated  to  this  subject  can  be accessed at any time by all employees worldwide.\n\nThe Group Internal Control organises annual self-assessment of  the  implementation  of  the  personal  data  protection compliance programme for all countries and functions.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Group's  digital  activities,  the  Internal  Audit Department conducts audit  checks  on  the  protection  of  the personal data of consumers.\n\nSince  2019,  a  specific  audit  programme  on  personal  data protection has been aimed at all European countries that are subject to GDPR, conducted by an independent auditor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Measures taken in favour of L'Or\u00e9al employees\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has implemented several other policies that contribute to  the  respect  of  employees'  human rights and fundamental freedoms,  notably  through  its  policies  on  workplace  health and safety, social dialogue and diversity, and its Share & Care programme (see paragraph 4.3.2.4.).\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  all  employees  receive  at  least  the minimum  salary  set  by  local  law  or  the  applicable  collective agreements, and that they receive a living wage that covers their basic needs, calculated in line with best practices. For the second consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al's fulfilment of this commitment around the world was certified by the NGO Fair Wage Network in 2023.\n\nThe subsidiaries must comply with applicable local legislation and the minimum set of core rules designed to prevent serious human  rights  violations.  The  details  and  implementation  of these  rules  is  described  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  Vigilance  Plan  (see section  3.4.),  which  also  explains  the  Group's  organisation  in the  area  of  human  rights.  In  addition,  compliance  is  verified through the programme of social audits and using the forced labour  self-assessment  tool  developed  by  NGO  the Fair Labour Association in collaboration with the Consumer Goods Forum, described in section 3.4 of L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance plan.\n\n## 4.3.3.5. Measures taken in favour of employees of the Group's suppliers in the context of their working conditions\n\nL'Or\u00e9al seeks out suppliers that share its ethical commitments,  namely  with  regard  to  human  rights  and working conditions of their employees.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  are  communicated  to  all  suppliers via the general terms of purchase.\n\nSuppliers identified in the Group's risk mapping must sign the Ethical Commitment Letter. Some may be audited. The details and  implementation  of  this Buy  &  Care programme  are described in L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance Plan (see section 3.4.) and in subparagraph 4.3.1.2.1.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al wants to carry this goal beyond the Group. This is why the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  includes  a  new demanding  commitment  ensuring  that  all  employees  of strategic suppliers are paid at least a living wage. Calculated by region and aligned with the best local practices, these new standards  must  allow  employees  to  cover  their  basic  needs and those of their family for decent housing, food, education and any other needs. In many countries, this living wage goes beyond the legal minimums.",

In this area, L'Or\u00e9al has a long-standing commitment to managing risks and reducing its environmental  footprint,  and  is  implementing  an  ambitious policy described in detail in subsection 4.3.1.\n\nA  responsible  approach  to  property  assets: for  prospective acquisitions of premises or building land, L'Or\u00e9al ensures that the  former  owners  and/or  occupiers  have  not  been  unfairly removed and/or that any expropriation by the authorities was conducted in accordance with international law, namely with the free agreement and compensation of the previous owners and/or occupants.\n\nResponsible sourcing: See paragraph\u00a04.3.1.3.\n\nInclusive  Sourcing -using  the  Group's  purchasing  power  to serve  social  inclusion: launched  in  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al's Inclusive Sourcing programme  supports  numerous  local  projects  in support  of  local  communities.  It  aims  to  use  the  Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion. A proportion of its purchases are dedicated to suppliers providing access to work and  a  sustainable  income  for  people  who  are  generally excluded  from  the  labour  market,  economically  vulnerable communities,  including  small  businesses  and  those  that struggle  to  access  major  contractors.  The  programme concerns all the Group's suppliers and values their commitment to DE&I issues. It involves, for example, fair trade producers,  companies  which  employ  people  with  a  disability,\n\nsocial inclusion companies, or companies owned by minorities (1) , where  national  legislation  permits.  Due  to  its global,  holistic  nature,  the Inclusive  Sourcing programme proposes a novel approach to sourcing. Rolled out in all Zones, it concerns  all  fields  of  purchasing (2) . Its  ambition  is  to associate  economic  performance  with  a  positive  corporate social responsibility footprint. 3,225 people with a disability in 36  countries  benefited  from  the  programme  in  2023,  an increase  of  30%  over  the  last  three  years.  The  programme now has 429 projects up and running in 1,069 local initiatives (including  an  additional  240  initiatives  launched  in  2023) in 67 countries, with the support of 86 third parties.\n\n## Focus on the Group's Inclusive sourcing in France\n\n100  projects  in  the  worldwide Inclusive  Sourcing programme support  employment  in  France.  They  are  rolled  out  under 176  local  initiatives.  In  2023, Inclusive  Sourcing in  France represented  3,300  full-time  jobs,  an  increase  of  33% compared to 2020, representing 825 jobs.\n\nThese  projects  cover  a  wide  range  of  purchases,  including: cardboard,  glass  and  plastic  packaging,  POS  advertising materials, services, filling and packing, and logistics.\n\n- \u00b7 18%  of  the  beneficiaries  are  people  with  a  disability (602 jobs);\n- \u00b7 Nearly  half  of  the  beneficiaries  are  in  zones  classified  as vulnerable (1,511 jobs). These are areas classified as 'Rural Revitalisation  Zones'  and  'Sensitive  Urban  Zones'.  These jobs cover production needs (glass bottles, tubes, cardboard  boxes,  subcontracting)  or  services  related  to L'Or\u00e9al's business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  involves,  for example, cleaning natural sites, setting up well-being workshops  for  people  in  vulnerable  situations,  repainting centres  for  elder  people  etc.  L'Or\u00e9al  has  also  developed  the L'Or\u00e9al Citizen (1) programme,  offering  its  employees  the opportunity to contribute to different causes through several ways, such as Payroll Giving, Hackathons  for  good, crowdfunding campaigns, and mentorship.\n\nBeauty for a Better Life -a L'Or\u00e9al Foundation programme for  vulnerable  people : Convinced that beauty contributes to the  process  of  rebuilding  oneself,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation, through  its  Beauty  for  a  Better  Life  programme,  assists fragile  people  in  improving  their  self-esteem  by  giving  them access  to  free  beauty  and  wellness  care.  The  L'Or\u00e9al Foundation also promotes employment for vulnerable women through  excellence  learning  programmes  in  the  beauty professions.\n\n## Beauty care and wellness treatments\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Foundation supports the provision of free beauty care and wellness treatments in medical and social environments  through  the  partnerships  it  has  built  with non-profit  and  hospital  organisations.  These  treatments  are provided by specially trained socio-beauticians or socio-hairdressers. They play a role in improving wellness, selfesteem,  fighting  spirit  and  social  cohesion.  They  offer essential  moments,  whether  for  patients  whose  bodies  are ravaged by illness or for people in a fragile social situation.\n\nIn  2023,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation  made  it  possible  for  more than  23,800  people  in  difficult  circumstances  to  receive beauty  care  and  wellbeing  treatments  in  France.  By increasing access to these treatments, the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation is also encouraging social innovation:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Foundation  continued  the  Mobile  Care  &  Wellness Centre  initiative  it  had  launched  in  2019,  in  the  \u00cele-deFrance, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and Hauts-de-France regions  of  France.  Nearly  1,700  vulnerable  or  isolated women have benefited from socio-beauty treatments;\n- \u00b7 in  partnership  with  Emma\u00fcs  Solidarit\u00e9,  three  beauty  and well-being  spaces  have  been  specifically  dedicated  to vulnerable people to give them  no-cost  access  to socio-beauty and socio-hairstyling services within a welcoming space.\n\n## Learning programmes on the beauty professions\n\nIn  partnership  with  local  NGOs  in  28  countries,  the  L'Or\u00e9al Foundation offers free learning courses on beauty professions to  women  in  very  difficult  social  or  economic  situations  to assist them in finding employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, as part of the Beauty For a Better Life programme, 11,836 people in very di/fficult social or economic situations were trained in Beauty professions.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Foundation partnership with M\u00e9decins du Monde for the  benefit  of  women  and  children : The  L'Or\u00e9al Foundation supports the M\u00e9decins du Monde (Doctors of the World)  association's  facial  reconstructive  surgery  operations ('Op\u00e9ration Sourire'). The  L'Or\u00e9al Foundation  enables children or women who suffer from congenital malformations or who are victims of physical violence to regain their integrity and return to their community.\n\n## 4.3.3.7. Measures taken in favour of the promotion of women's rights\n\nAs  an  active  supporter  of  the  UN  Women's  Empowerment Principles, the Group is involved in numerous initiatives aimed not  only  at  improving  the  situation  of  women  in  the  private and  public  spheres,  but  also  at  recognising  the  contribution of women to the advancement of humanity.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.1. Responsible communication\n\nThe Group's Code of Ethics and the principles of Responsible Communication,  which  are  summarised  in  an  operational brochure distributed worldwide, especially cover the prohibition of stereotypes and degrading images of women.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.2. Gender equality\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  highest  levels  of responsibility,  is  a  key  challenge  for  the  Group,  both  to promote a culture of inclusion and to increase L'Or\u00e9al's ability to  innovate.  The  Group,  therefore,  ensures  that  all  jobs  are equally accessible to women and men, both at the recruitment level and  with  regard  to  career  development.  Special attention is given to pivotal periods such as parenthood (see paragraph 4.3.2.6.). During supplier audits, L'Or\u00e9al also seeks to ensure the absence of discrimination and sexual harassment (see subparagraph 4.3.1.2.1.).",

For Women in Science: a programme of the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation\n\nSince  1998,  the  L'Or\u00e9al-Unesco  For  Women  in  Science programme has worked to accelerate the careers of female scientists  and  fight  the  obstacles  they  encounter,  enabling them to contribute to solving the great challenges of our time.\n\nTo  date,  the  International  'L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO  For  Women  in Science'  Awards  has  honoured  127  women,  distinguished for their careers and the excellence of their scientific work. To celebrate the 25 th anniversary of the award, a special tribute was  paid  to  three  refugee  scientists,  highlighting  their remarkable  scientific  contributions  and  experience.  The number of women who have been awarded the International Award and gone on to win Nobel Prizes has risen from 5 to 7 this year, following recognition of the exceptional achievements of Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Anne L'Huillier, who were awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine and the Nobel Prize for Physics respectively.\n\nEach year, the Young Talent programme rewards more than 250  women  at  PhD  and  post-doctoral  levels.  These programmes are rolled out in more than 110 countries. Among these programmes, the one dedicated to Sub-Saharan Africa has  increased  the  number  of  endowments  it  awards  from 20 to 30.\n\nAimed  at  encouraging  girls  aged  15  and  over  to  pursue scientific careers, the For Girls in Science programme saw its numbers  increase  this  year,  now  reaching  350  students.  In partnership with Universcience, the Foundation organised an interactive exhibition in the Forum of the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie, a science museum in Paris. During this meeting, members  of  the  Young  Talent  programme  discussed  their careers and their research work and answered questions from more than 500 high school girls and boys.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.3.7.4. The L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women: a charitable fund to support women in extremely vulnerable situations throughout the world\n\nAs a long-term supporter of women's rights, L'Or\u00e9al launched in  2020  a  \u20ac50  million  charitable  endowment  fund  as  part of  its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme.  In  2023  the  Fund was  extended  for  an  additional  three  years,  with  an endowment  of  \u20ac30  million.  It  aims  to  support  local organisations  in  their  efforts  to  assist  women  in  extremely vulnerable  situations,  prevent  domestic  and  sexual  violence and  support  victims.  Particular  attention  is  paid  to  projects aimed at helping women who are vulnerable on a number of fronts,  particularly  refugees  or  women  with  disabilities.\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nBeyond emergency relief the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women wants to  make  a  proactive  contribution  to  the  resilience  of  women and  girls,  by  supporting  social  and  professional  integration projects  and  breaking  down  the  barriers  to  education.  Since it  was launched, the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women has supported more than 420 organisations around the world, which support more than 2,560,000 direct beneficiaries.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.5. Brand programmes: examples\n\nSince  2020,  YSL  Beauty  has  been  committed  to  combating domestic  violence  with  its  ' Abuse  is  Not  Love '  programme. The brand works with local NGOs to help and raise awareness among victims and those close to them of the telltale signs an abusive relationship. In 2023, 422,553 people were supported by  and/or  completed  a  learning  programme  delivered  by  a local community partner.\n\nOver  the  past  15  years,  the  Helena  Rubinstein  brand  has supported  women  who  want  to  become  entrepreneurs. In  2023,  it  supported  484  women  with  the  assistance  of  its partner NGOs Forces Femmes in France and China Women's Development Foundation in China (1) .\n\nIn 2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel  launched  its Head  Up campaign,  a  learning  programme  co-created  with  the  NGO NAMI, to help haircare professionals reduce their mental load. 77,818 hairstylists have already taken this online course.\n\n## 4.3.3.7.6. Responsible and Inclusive Sourcing\n\nOver  60%  of  people  supported  by  the  Group's Inclusive Sourcing programme are women (see paragraph 4.3.3.6.). A total  of  42,571  jobs  across  94  projects  -  encompassing 230 local initiatives - specifically related to the emancipation of women in 38 countries, with the support of 21 associations and NGO partners. These projects support:\n\n- \u00b7 female producers of raw materials such as shea, centella, argan,  baba\u00e7u  or  galanga  cultivated  and  harvested  in accordance with fair trade principles;\n- \u00b7 women from various vulnerable local communities, or who have assumed positions usually held by men;\n- \u00b7 beneficiaries through support for women-owned businesses (suppliers that are 51% or more owned, controlled and led by women). In 2023, the Group continued to accelerate its strategy to support female entrepreneurship, reconfirming its  commitment in WEConnect International (2) . Since 2020, the Group has increased eightfold the number of jobs with suppliers owned, controlled and managed by women: 5,262 jobs in 27 countries. This strategy, initiated many years ago in  the  United  States  through  the  partnership  with  The Women's  Business  Enterprise  National Council, is  being deployed and accelerated worldwide;\n- \u00b7 single mothers (746 single mothers in Latin America);\n- \u00b7 military wives (in the United States); and\n- \u00b7 women who are victims of violence.\n\nIn  addition  to  agriculture,  these  projects  concern  a  broad range  of  manufacturing  activities  and  services:  production, assembly,  logistics,  sales,  marketing,  or  digital  business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tax policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  considers  that  taxation  is  an  integral  part  of  its Corporate  Social  Responsibility  and  constitutes  a  way  to participate  positively  to  the  development  of  the  countries  in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Group's tax policy forms part of the sustainability of its business. It is based on three pillars, which are defined in the Internal  Tax  Charter  prepared  and  distributed  around  the world: Compliance, Transparency and Legitimacy.\n\n## Compliance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  completes  its  tax  declarations  and  pays  its  taxes  by the  deadlines  in  compliance  with  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  the  Group operates.\n\nSpecial  vigilance  is  required  on  compliance  with  the  rules related to the fight against tax fraud and tax avoidance.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  located  in  countries  where  it  conducts  a  real operational and commercial activity. If applicable, the Group's presence in certain so-called 'tax haven' (1) countries is justified for  operational  reasons  and  the  development  of  its  activity, and not for tax purposes.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al ensures that transactions between Group companies are carried out in compliance with the arm's length principle defined  by  the  OECD  and  the  UN  and  satisfies  increasingly digitalised reporting obligations (transfer pricing documentation, country-by-country reporting etc.).\n\nIn view of the OECD reform that provides for a minimum level of  taxation  of  15%  in  each  country  (Pillar  2),  L'Or\u00e9al  is preparing to adapt its information systems in order to comply with this future regulation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al aims for excellence in tax compliance.\n\n## Transparency\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  establishes  and  maintains  relations  with  Tax  and Customs Authorities based on transparency, pursuant to the Group's 'zero tolerance' rule on corruption.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also develops a constructive relationship with Tax and Customs Authorities, a relationship based on the principles of cooperation and mutual respect. L'Or\u00e9al responds appropriately  and  promptly  to  requests  from  the  tax authorities regarding the exchange  of  information,  in compliance with tax conventions.\n\nWhere permitted to do so by governments, L'Or\u00e9al joins the cooperative  compliance  programmes  launched  by  the  tax authorities.  For  example,  the  trust  relationship  (' relation  de confiance ') with the French tax authorities.\n\nThe  Group  may  contribute  to  the  analysis  of  legislative changes  at  the  request  of  Tax  and  Customs  Authorities  or professional  associations  involved.  Consequently,  the  Group takes part in OECD working groups relating to Pillars 1 and 2.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al considers global challenges and standards in terms of tax  transparency.  In  particular,  it  adheres  to  the  reporting recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and, more  specifically,  standards  GRI  207-1,  GRI  207-2  and GRI  207-3.  Documents  relating  to  the  Group's  ESG performance,  including  the  GRI  standards,  are  published  on our website (2) .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a member of the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF),  a  European  companies  association  that  seeks  to increase transparency in the tax debate.\n\nThe Group has a Speak Up programme for L'Or\u00e9al's internal and  external  stakeholders  to  express  any  serious  concerns they have, so that the Group and the Ethics Department can address them.\n\nThe  Group  is  careful  to  ensure  that  its  behaviour  in  tax matters is beyond  reproach,  in compliance with the fundamental principles of the Code of Ethics.\n\n## Legitimacy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al legitimately applies the most relevant tax treatment, in accordance with economic realty and operational objectives, in compliance with the letter and spirit of the laws in force. The Group does not pursue an aggressive tax policy through  articficial  structures  or  transactions  that  have  no economic or commercial substance and whose purpose would be strictly  fiscal.\n\nIn  an  evolving  international  tax  environment,  the  positions taken by the Group may be questioned and subject to tax and customs  audits  by  local  authorities.  If  there  is  disagreement with  a  Tax  or  Customs  Authority,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  able  to legitimately  defend  its  interpretation  of  the  law,  prove  its good faith and, as needed, bring the disputes to court.\n\nA regular review of tax risks, carried out by the Group's Tax Department in contact with the local financial teams, enables the  risks  to  be  assessed,  resulting,  if  applicable,  to  the recognition  of  a  provision.  The  main  risks  are  reported  to the General Management and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Organisation\n\nCentralised expertise and a strong geographical presence of the tax function in the Countries ensure compliance with these three pillars.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officers are responsible for tax compliance, backed up and relayed by the Tax and Accounting Departments. These  Departments  monitor  changes  in  tax  regulations  to ensure that the Group complies with these regulations. They are assisted, where applicable, by external advisors.\n\n## Centralised expertise\n\nWithin  the  Department  of  Operational  Finance,  the  Group Tax  Department  ensures  compliance  with  the  Tax  Policy  in collaboration with the Finance Departments, through intermediaries in the form of different group-wide tax experts:\n\n- \u00b7 Intra-group Transactions & Customs,  which  ensures compliance  with  tax  and  customs  standards  and  secures the  prices  of  intra-group  transactions  and  the  related documentation;\n- \u00b7 Analytics  & Compliance,  which  analyses,  verifies  and informs on the Group's compliance and global tax liability;\n- \u00b7 Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), which assists and provides tax advice on proposed merger-acquisition projects;\n- \u00b7 Tax Digitalisation,  which  enables  the  Group  to  meet  the new  requirements  for  digitalisation  imposed  by  the  tax authorities (e-returns, e-invoicing, e-audits etc.);",

Social data\n\nScope of consolidation: newly acquired entities are included in the  scope  of  publication  as  soon  as  possible  following  their acquisition  and,  at  the  latest,  in  the  first  full  financial  year following their acquisition. By way of exception, if all or part of the information and data relating to a newly acquired entity are  not  available  in  sufficiently  reliable  form,  this  entity  will only be included from the second full financial year following its acquisition.\n\nEntities sold are excluded from the scope of publication from the financial year in which they are sold.\n\nThe employees indicated and their breakdown correspond to the total workforce (1) .\n\nThe 393 employees in the Luxury of Retail (formerly known as Retail  Excellence  4),  Centre  thermal  de  La  Roche  Posay, Thermes Saint-Gervais Les Bains Le Fayet, Real Campus by L'Or\u00e9al (hairstyling and entrepreneurship school) and Mugler Fashion  entities  are  included  in  the  total  workforce.  The distributions of these employees are calculated in proportion to  the  distribution  of  France  employees.  They  are  excluded from  the  indicators  on  diversity,  learning,  minimum  salaries and the number of collective agreements.\n\nIndicators: the  indicators  chosen  are  those  used  in  the management of employees and of the social aspects of the Company. They reflect the results of the HR policy.\n\nData :  four  methods  are  used  to  collect  data  for  the  defined scope.  Most  of  the  data  are  collected  using  the  dedicated 'Country Reporting'  Intranet,  available  in  all  countries  in which  there  is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  'subsidiary'.  In  the  context  of  this 'Country/Region  Reporting',  a subsidiary  is  a  structural  HR concept: each subsidiary comprises one or more legal entities, and  covers  one  country  or  supra-national  or  sub-national region.  Exceptionally,  the  United  States,  Korea  and  Hong Kong  SAR  each  have  two  subsidiaries.  Some  subsidiaries cover  several  countries:  the  Baltic  Countries  (Lithuania, Latvia,  Estonia),  Croatia  (Croatia,  Slovenia,  Bosnia),  the United  Arab  Emirates-Saudi  Arabia  (United  Arab  Emirates, Saudi Arabia), and the United Kingdom (United Kingdom and Ireland). The  system  covers  several  topics:  employees; learning;  absenteeism;  labour  relations;  the  L'Or\u00e9al Share  & Care programme; compensation; diversity; recruitment; freedom of association; and profit sharing. At the beginning of the financial year, the local HR Directors provide the required data  for  the  previous  year.  Other  data  are  collected  by  the Learning  and  Recruitment  Departments  using  dedicated systems which follow the same operational and dissemination approach.  If  information  is  not  consolidated  for  the  entire scope of the Group, it can be extrapolated from the available results  for  the  entities  connected  to  the  local  Information Systems (IS), provided that the scope covered by such entities is  representative.  The  data  relating  to  specific  populations, such  as  expatriates  or  key  positions,  for  example,  are gathered from the 'CAROL' online career monitoring system,\n\ndeployed in all  subsidiaries  of  the  Group.  Trained  employees include  the  total  number  of  employees,  including  those  who left the Group during the year or who completed at least one learning course during the year, regardless of the format (inperson,  virtual  classroom,  digital)  and  length  of  the  learning course.  Hours  spent  in  a  learning  course  that  straddles  two years  are  recorded  in  the  second  year.  Learning  hours  may include  lunch  breaks  for  all-day  learning.  Concerning  the L'Or\u00e9al Share  &  Care indicator  relating  to  healthcare coverage,  the  best  practices  in  the  countries  are  regularly evaluated in each country in which the Group is present.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been  put  in  place.  They  are  reviewed  each  year,  taking  into account  the  Statutory  Auditors'  recommendations  and the monitoring objectives for subsequent years (updating the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition and their communication, monitoring and control process).\n\n## 4.5.1.2. Health and safety data\n\nScope of consolidation: safety indicators relate to 95% of the sites,  such  as  factories,  distribution  centres,  administrative sites, research centres with more than 50 employees, stores, and  salesforces.  At  year-end  2023,  173  administrative  sites and  research  centres,  salesforces  and  stores  participated  in the reporting. To achieve better monitoring of accident history by type of site, safety reporting from administrative sites has been  refined  and  split  into  three  categories:  administrative sites  with  only  administrative  staff,  salesforces  for  travelling staff  and  stores  for  in-store  beauty  consultants  managed by L'Or\u00e9al.  The safety indicators of the factories, distribution centres, administrative sites or research centres sold or closed during  the  financial  year  are  reported  in  full  up  to  the  date they  exit  the  scope.  The  factories,  distribution  centres, administrative  sites  or  research  centres  that  join  the  Group have  a  maximum  period  of  two  years  to  integrate  the environmental  and  safety  reporting  systems.  It  should  be noted that the number of sites varies little from one year to the next.\n\nIndicators: the  indicators  applied  are  those  used  in  the management  of  the  Group's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results of  the  Group's  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  policy. Hours worked report the time during which the staff is exposed to  professional  risks,  including  remote  work  or  the  equivalent. They  include  overtime  hours.  However,  they  do  not  include public holidays or days of absence, such as sick days and paid holidays.\n\nData: the  health  and  safety  data  are  collected  using  the dedicated  Intranet-based  site  reporting  system.  This  is available in all countries in which there is a L'Or\u00e9al subsidiary. The  required  data  are  reported  every  month  by  the  local managers.  When  the  data  are  compiled,  each  site  or  zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided. A process of continuous improvement of these systems has been put in place.",

These data are monitored  and  included  in  the  annual  consistency  review, before being included in the reported figures.\n\n## 4.5.1.3. Environmental data\n\nScope  of  consolidation: environmental  indicators  cover  95% of the factories and  distribution centres, as well as administrative  sites  and  research  centres  with  more  than 50  people  due  to  the  acquisition  of  A\u0113sop.  Environmental indicators for sites sold or closed during the financial year are reported in full up to the date they exit the scope. Sites joining the Group have a maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental  and  safety  reporting  systems.  The indicators do not take into account the impacts of exceptional external incidents or events, such as construction or extension works. Similarly, in the special case where a subcontractor is located geographically on the sites, its impacts are not taken into  account.  In  2023,  167  sites  participated  in  the  reporting and  164  were  still  consolidated  at  the  end  of  the  year, including 37 factories, 43 distribution centres, eight research centres and 77 administrative sites. If some sites are unable to obtain  certain  information  (e.g.  water  withdrawal,  waste generation  etc.)  they  may  temporarily  use  estimates,  which must be validated by the Operations Department. In addition, 100% of these operated sites provided information on energy consumption and CO2 emissions, 100% of the operated sites reported their water consumption and 100% of the operated sites reported their quantity of waste. The sites of Vichy and La  Roche  Posay  are  part  of  a  single  company  (Cosm\u00e9tique Active  Production)  but  are  accounted  for  as  two  Group factories.  Four  Group  factories  contain  a  logistics  centre  in their  building.  These  four  logistics  centres  are  not  included  in the  count  of  the  total  number  of  Group  logistics  centres.  It should be noted that the number of sites varies little from one year to the next.\n\nIndicators: the  indicators  chosen  are  those  used  in  the management of the Company's sites. They reflect the results of the Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy.\n\nActivity: the activity of L'Or\u00e9al sites is measured on the basis of  finished  goods  for  industrial  sites  and  hours  worked  for administrative  sites  and  research  centres.  The  production units  included  are  the  equivalent  units  produced  on-site  or affected by occasional subcontracting. Hours worked are the hours  performed  on-site,  thus  excluding  remote  working hours.\n\nOperated  sites: the  Group's  operated  sites  are  all  its  sites, irrespective  of  their  purpose,  with  the  exception  of  sites normally accommodating fewer than 50 employees.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nMethodological notes\n\nGreenhouse gases: the Group's CO2 emissions are calculated in accordance  with  the  concepts  defined  by  the  GHG Protocol, and monitored according to the Market-Based CO2 indicator.\n\nManagement  of  the  reference  year: in  accordance  with the  methodology  of  the  GHG Protocol  relating  to  the management  of  reference  years,  CO2  emissions  data  are reviewed, if necessary, in accordance with the rules defined by the Group using a like-for-like recalculation. In this way, base years take into account investments and divestments (brands, sites), changes  in  methodologies,  significant  errors  and changes in scope. Any changes in base years are validated by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nScope 1:  the main emissions for operated sites are related to natural  gas,  for  which  consumption  data  is  taken  from supplier invoices. Potential leaks of cooling gas  from refrigeration  units  are  also  included  in  the  calculations.  The emission factors used come from the French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Ma\u00eetrise de l'\u00c9nergie - ADEME) Base Carbone database for fossil fuels, such as natural gas, fuel oil etc. and the 6 th report of the IPCC (IPCC AR6) for cooling gas. All data are incorporated into the internal reporting software on a monthly basis.\n\nScope 2: the main emissions for operated sites are related to electricity, for which consumption data is taken from supplier invoices.  The  emission  factors  used  come  directly  from  the sites'  electricity  suppliers,  using  the  Market-Based approach, or from the International Energy Agency (IEA) if the data are not available. The emission factors used for emissions related to  heat,  cooling  and  steam  networks  come  from  local suppliers. All data are incorporated into the internal reporting software on a monthly basis.\n\nScope 3: Scope 3 emissions, linked to the L'Or\u00e9al value chain, are  calculated  annually  using  emission  factors  from  various databases,  specific  to  each  Scope 3  category,  including, among  others, the ADEME  Base  Carbone  database, EcoInvent, the DBEIS and the IEA.\n\nLevel of uncertainty: for Scopes 1 and 2 of operated sites, the level of uncertainty at the Group level is approximately 1% for factories and distribution centres, and 5% for administrative sites  and  research  centres.  For  Scope 3, the  level  of uncertainty  is  higher  given  the  volume  of  data  required  for calculation, such as the emission factors of the energy used to heat the water necessary for the usage phase of our rinse-off products all over the world, the quantity of water necessary for  rinsing,  CO2  emissions  of  raw  materials  and  packaging suppliers, distances travelled for transportation etc.\n\nMeasurement  of  the  global  CO2  impact  of  the  Group's business  activities  is  essential  information.  In  light  of  the commitments  made  to  combating  climate  change,  L'Or\u00e9al strives year after year to increase the reliability of this data. The level  of  uncertainty  of  the  Group's  Scope 3  emissions  is estimated to be between 20% and 30%. Unlike Scopes 1 and 2,  changes  in  Scope 3  emissions  may  relate  more  to  the quality  of  the  data  collected  and  the  calculation  methods used,  rather  than  to  a  real  change  in  performance.  This margin of uncertainty with regard to Scope 3 is a reality for all companies  and  does  not  make  it  possible  to  consider  this data as an adequate benchmark or  method of performance assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, it is still monitored to ensure compliance with the commitments that have already been made. It is defined as follows: a site must meet the following requirements: Direct CO2 (Scope 1) = 0, with the specific exception of the gas used for catering, the fuel oil used for sprinkler tests, the fuel oil (or diesel)  used  temporarily  by  backup  units,  fossil  energy consumed during maintenance of on-site renewable facilities and cooling gas leaks if they are lower than 130 tonnes CO2 eq./year;  and  indirect  Market  Based  CO2  (Scope  2)  =  0. It  should  be  noted  that  renewable  energy  sources  no  longer need to be located less than 500 kilometres from the site.\n\nThe  Vichy  and  La  Roche  Posay  sites  are  part  of  a  single company (CAP), but are recognised as two Group factories, including in the recognition of sites that use 100% renewable energy (formerly known as 'carbon neutral' status).\n\nSafety equipment :  This primarily includes the operational use or maintenance of:\n\n- \u00b7 all firefighting equipment;\n- \u00b7 permanent  or  temporary  generators  intended  to  provide power for the purposes of (i) personnel protection, (ii) data backup,  (iii)  maintaining  processes  that  are  at  risk  or sensitive,  (iv)  storing  perishable  or  heat-sensitive  raw materials.\n\nWastewater: for industrial sites, the  Chemical  Oxygen Demand (COD) covers the volumes of wastewater leaving the plant, whether or not they have been treated on the site.\n\nWaterloop: see the Waterloop Factory concept in subparagraph  4.3.1.1.4. Exceptions  to  the  definition  of Waterloop status may be authorised if they are approved by the  Operations  Department.  These  exceptions  relate  to regulatory  constraints  such  as  the  requirements  of  the  US Food  and  Drug  Administration,  or  the  Group's  Quality requirements  or  accidents  or  maintenance.  For  example,  in 2023,  this  was  the  case  for  the  Settimo  site  due  to  a  new product  mix  that  led  to  the  installation  of  an  additional osmosis plant.\n\nWaste: L'Or\u00e9al  classifies  as  transportable  waste  everything that comes out of a factory or a distribution centre that is not a  finished  or  semi-finished  product  for  consumption.  For  a factory, this includes, for example, raw materials packaging or packaging  materials,  broken  pallets  etc.  In  order  to  improve the system of waste performance monitoring and exhaustively  record  the  waste  generated  by  the  use  of returnable  packaging,  a  system  of  recording  returnable packaging  at  source  was  put  in  place  in  2014.  L'Or\u00e9al  thus records  the  weight  of  its  returnable  packaging  at  source  in transportable waste. Each site maximises the number of times returnable  packaging  is  used.  Recording  the  weight  of returnable  packaging  at  source  is  intended  to  encourage rotation of this returnable packaging and contributes, through its reuse, to increasing its useful life. Sites that no longer send any waste for destruction or to landfill are considered to have attained a 100% recovery rate (2) .\n\nBiodiversity  inventory: inventories  that  describe  the  actual situation of the sites in terms of species and habitats present in  the  zone  studied,  must  be  carried  out  by  a  external organisation at least every three years.\n\nLand  occupancy: a standardised approach  has  been developed with the support of The Biodiversity Consultancy to enable  the  land-use  biodiversity  footprint  of  bio-based ingredients to be calculated each year. This approach is based on three parameters: (1) the ground surface required, (2) the loss of biodiversity due to land use and intensity of agricultural practices  and  (3)  the  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the ecosystem in question. The first two parameters are multiplied to represent a ground  surface  area  in  which  100% of  biodiversity  is  lost  (value  expressed  in  Mean Species Abundance per hectare, MSA.ha).\n\nLand-use biodiversity footprint =\n\n- \u00b7 (1) Ground surface x (2) Biodiversity loss due to land use and intensity of agricultural practices (MSA.ha),\n- \u00b7 (3)  The  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the  ecosystem  in question.\n\nThe required ground surface (1) is estimated in three steps:\n\n- \u00b7 step 1: The volumes of raw materials (combined ingredients) are divided into volumes of ingredients made from plants;\n- \u00b7 step 2: Ingredient volumes are converted to plant volumes using  conversion  factors  based  on  life-cycle  assessment data  (Ecoinvent, World  Food  Database,  Agribalyse), supplier data and literature;\n- \u00b7 step 3: The ground surface required to produce the plants is estimated by multiplying the plant volume by the average yields  for  each  plant.  For  the  main  plants,  average  yields were  extracted  at  the  most  accurate  spatial  resolution available  in  the  supply  data  using  the Our  World  in  Data (average  yields  available  until  2018)  and  MapSPAM (average yields from 2010) spatial databases. A review of the  literature  was  used  to  estimate  the  average  (global) yield  for  the  other  plants.  An  additional  land  use  area  for crop-related  infrastructure  (roads  and  farms)  was  also taken into account for each plant, calculated on the basis of  a  proportion of the infrastructure surface area specific to each plant (data taken from Ecoinvent).\n\nIngredients  whose  traceability  is  not  currently  known  (plants and/or  countries)  have  been  integrated  into  the  footprint using their relative contribution distribution when the data is known.\n\nSince  2021,  waste  generation  no  longer  includes  the  sludge from the wastewater treatment plans at the Group's sites.",

This  metric  is  used  to measure ecosystem integrity.\n\nBiodiversity loss coefficients for land use are derived from the GLOBIO model database (providing average biodiversity loss values  according  to  land-use  type  and  intensity)  and  then refined  for  each  plant  based  on  a  literature  review  (final values vary between  70%  and  90%  biodiversity  loss depending  on  the  plant).  For  infrastructure,  the  biodiversity loss  coefficient  for  land  use  is  also  taken  from  the  GLOBIO models (the value for urbanised areas, i.e. 95% biodiversity loss, is identical for each plant).\n\n## Focus on the significance of biodiversity in the ecosystem in question (3):\n\nThe  significance  of  biodiversity  in  the  production  area  is assessed using the Species Threat Abatement and Recovery (STAR)  metric.  STAR  assesses  the  conservation  potential  in terms of reducing the risk of species extinction in an area of special interest either by threat reduction  or  habitat restoration.  The  metric  was  developed  based  on  data  from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (STAR mapping in December 2022 is based on the 2019.3 version of the IUCN Red  List;  STAR  currently  includes  mammals,  birds  and amphibians).  The  80 th percentile  was  used  to  represent  the presence  of  high  values  while  avoiding  overestimation  by taking into account the maximum value only. Each region or country is then assigned to a risk category ranging from very low  to  very  high.  As  the  STAR  distribution  is  highly  skewed towards low values (97% of STAR values worldwide are in the very low and low categories), the use of the mean or median is\n\n## 4.5.2. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future data\n\n## 4.5.2.1. Transforming the Group's activities\n\nReduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  transport of  finished  products : the  scope  considered  includes  the transportation  of  the  Group's  finished  and  promotional products from its production sites to the first point of delivery to  the  customer.  Deliveries  made  directly  to  consumers  are excluded.  The  period  considered  is  12  months,  between  1 November of year n-1 and 31 October of year n. Calculations are  made  using  the  EcoTransIT  World  platform.  The methodology  used  is  provided  by  independent  scientific institutes  (IFEU,  INFRAS  and  Fraunhofer  IML)  and  complies with ISO14083 and GLEC standards. The exact methodology is available on the EcoTransIT World website.\n\nRespecting biodiversity with traceable, bio-based ingredients from sustainable sources : the calculation of the percentage of biobased  ingredients  for  traced  formulas  from  sustainable sources is based on the following definitions: a raw material is considered  to  be  bio-based  when  more  than  50%  of  the carbons  it  contains  are  of  plant  origin  (according  to ISO  16128);  an  ingredient  is  considered  traced  when  the following  three  pieces  of  information  are  available:  the botanical species, the country in which it grows or is collected, the growing or collection method; an ingredient is considered to be sustainably sourced when, on the basis of the elements of  traceability,  it  has  been  analysed  for  environmental  and\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nMethodological notes\n\nnot appropriate. Each region or country is then assigned to a risk category ranging from very low to very high by taking the higher of the following two values: the STAR 80th percentile for threat reduction or the STAR 80th percentile for habitat restoration. As the distribution of STAR values is very uneven and skewed towards low and very low values, any region or country  categorised  as  medium,  high  or  very  high  risk represents an important area for biodiversity in which there is a significant risk of impacting rich and vulnerable biodiversity.\n\nData :  environmental  data  are  collected  using  the  dedicated Intranet-based site reporting system, available in all countries in  which there is a L'Or\u00e9al subsidiary. The required data are reported every month by the local managers. When the data are compiled, each Site or Zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided. A process of continuous improvement of these  systems  has  been  put  in  place  and  they  are  reviewed each year by the Statutory Auditors. They are modified taking into account their recommendations and monitoring objectives  for  subsequent  years,  such  as  updating  the indicators  to  be  monitored,  improving  their  definition,  and  the communication, monitoring and control processes. In rare cases, certain data already published for the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end  of  the  financial  year.  These  data  are  monitored  and included in the annual consistency review. They are included in the  reported  figures  each  year.  The  data  can  also  be amended  in  the  case  of  variations  in  methodology.  This  is particularly  the  case  in  2023  in  the  calculation  of  CO2 emissions for Scopes 1 and 2. In fact, in 2023, L'Or\u00e9al decided to stop using renewable attributes produced in excess on one site  to  cover  the  non-renewable  energy  consumption  of another site if the latter is outside 'Market boundary' criteria (CDP Technical Note: Accounting of Scope 2 emissions ).\n\nsocial risk (SCAN Index). If no risk has been identified, the raw material is considered to be sustainably sourced. If risks have been identified, an adapted action plan must have been put in place  with  this  supplier.  This  action  plan  must  have  been verified by an independent third party. Such verification may take the form of an audit, certification, or a field project put in place  with  the  support  of  an  NGO.  This  method  ensures compliance  with  the  basic  and  progressive  criteria  of  the sustainable sourcing  policy  for  the  Group's  raw  materials. The calculation of this indicator is based on actual purchases for  the  period  from  January  to  November  2023,  excluding volumes of ingredients used for fragrance compositions (<1%), subcontracting  volumes  (0.8%)  as  well  as  volumes  from factories  (India,  Argentina  and  Kenya)  not  linked  to  the  IDG management system (3.3%).\n\nReduction  of  water  consumption  related  to  the  use  of  the products : the scope of consolidation refers to the data on the products  sold  over  a  period  of  12  months  from  1 January to 31 December of 2023.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is based on the average water volume necessary per usage dose for the use of the Group's products by consumers. These data are provided by the IDG management software, which is used for the economic results. It  includes all global sales of finished products, both rinse-off and  leave-in.  The  only  exception  is  samples,  which  are  not products sold and are therefore not taken into account.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The indicator covers the Group's scope and  concerns  new  products  or  products  updated  by  design centres that were manufactured by the Group's factories or by  subcontractors.  They  had  an  availability  date  at  the distribution centre that was scheduled for between 1 January and  31  December  2022.  The  analysis  covers  all  the  Group's brands, excluding products not sold (i.e. samples, testers, gifts, products  made  at  the  point  of  sale,  temporary  activations, promotional  products  and  additional  packaging relating  to 'Travel Retail'), newly acquired brands that are not yet fully integrated  into  the  Group's  product  design  ecosystem (Mugler, Logocos, Thayers, Takami, Youth to the people, 3CE and Skin better science).\n\nThe indicator  covers  products  with  formulas/packaging  that have  been  developed  and  produced  for  the  first  time, products with formulas/packaging that were updated in 2023 (i.e.  underwent  a  major  change  in  packaging  or  formula requiring a change in the commercial code) or products that have been improved in terms of the social dimension.\n\n## Ingredients in formulas are from biobased sources, derived from abundant materials or from circular processes\n\nScope of consolidation : the scope of consolidation corresponds  to  the  12  months  of  the  year.  It  covers  the cosmetic products manufactured in the L'Or\u00e9al factories and the finished products purchased from subcontractors.\n\nThe scope covers  only  the  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  operating  under the  SAP WISE  system,  which  permits  the  feedback  of information via  the  IDG  information  system.  To  date,  there are only four Group factories that are outside the scope: the factories  in  Pune  and  Badi  in  India,  the  Magdal  factory  in Israel and the Nairobi factory in Kenya.\n\nThe indicator: the reporting covers 99.4% of production from L'Or\u00e9al  factories.  This  indicator  is  evaluated  for  all  the Group's active formulas and is calculated on the basis of the data on production volume  (this is a calculation at the level of the total portfolio of ingredients used by the Group, and not by  formula).  The  data  are  processed,  including  consistency checks and corrections of anomalies if necessary.\n\nData :  calculation  of  this  indicator  relies  solely  on  the  dry material,  excluding  the  'water'  used  in  certain  formulations. There are three elements that are calculated independently. The  'biobased'  portion  represents  the  percentage  of  raw materials of renewable origin in L'Or\u00e9al's portfolio according to the definition of ISO 16128. The 'abundant mineral' portion refers to the percentage of ingredients of mineral origin, the abundance of which allows sustainable use and the inorganic ingredients,  i.e.  non-mineral  and  not  containing  any  carbon atoms (e.g. oxygenated water), obtained by green processes. The definition of abundant minerals has been established by the  Raw  Materials  Department  (D\u00e9partement  des  mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res - DIMP) with the assistance of an expert consultant from  the  French  Bureau  of  Geological  and  Mining  Research (Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res - BRGM). An initial list was available at the start of 2023 that covers 40% in  volume  of  the  minerals  used  by  the  Group,  i.e.  463  raw materials identified.  This  list  is  subject  to  change  and  will  be updated over the coming years. Finally, the 'circular process' portion  is  still  being  established  by  the  Raw  Materials Department (DIMP) with the assistance of experts and will be made available soon.\n\n(1)\n\n## Resources - Data on packaging indicators\n\nScope  of  consolidation: the  packaging  data  cover  all  the finished products leaving the factories, with the exception of certain finished products for which the data are not yet linked to  the  central  information  systems.  This  is  the  case  for  the products  from  the  Nairobi  (Kenya),  Lahore  (Pakistan)  and Syntaric  (Argentina)  factories (1) , for  certain  subcontracted products  from  recent  acquisitions  and  for  the  packaging specific  to  Travel  Retail.  This  packaging  data  excludes  POS materials and  consumables  managed  by  factories  for transporting palettes.\n\n## Indicators\n\n## 1. Percentage  of  new  or  updated  products  with  a  better environmental profile due to improved packaging\n\nEach year, SPOT calculates the proportion of new or updated products  whose  environmental  profile  has  been  improved. For  a  new  product,  improvement  is  measured  in  relation  to an average of the brand's existing and comparable products. For  an  updated  product,  improvement  is  measured  and compared  to  the  previous  version  of  the  product.  SPOT  tool separates the packaging, formula and manufacturing footprints  which  allows  to  identify  product  with  improved packaging footprint.\n\n## 2. Percentage of certified paper and cardboard\n\nThe  data  on  the  percentage  of  FSC-certified  paper  and cardboard  (sourced  from  wood  derivatives)  comes  from tracking  the  supplies  of  all  suppliers.  The  Group's sourcing entities  demand  that  each  of  their  suppliers  complete  the information on tonnage and provide the related certifications. The data are aggregated by the central sourcing department.\n\n## 3. Reduction in intensity of the quantity of packaging used for the Group's products\n\nThe reduction in packaging intensity is measured in packaging weight divided by the weight of the formula. The unit is g/g. The  scope  is  all  the  packaging  leaving  a  factory  (primary, secondary  or  tertiary),  excluding  the  factories  in  Pune  and Badi  (India).  The  reduction  in  intensity  is  calculated  from specification  systems  for  filling,  packaging  and  production articles. The data are aggregated at global level by the data management teams.\n\n## 4. Percentage  of  packaging  made  of  recycled  or  biobased sources of plastic\n\nThe  tonnages  of  plastic  materials  coming  from  recycled  or from  biobased  sources  used  in  the  products  come  from specification  systems for the filling  and  packing  components and  the  production  of  finished  products.  The  data  are aggregated at global level  by  the  data management teams. The  portion  of  recycled  plastic  is  an  actual  rate  of  recycled material  in  the  packaging:  it  does  not  come  from  a  mass balance certification system. The scope of this indicator is all the plastic  from  all  our  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary packaging leaving the factory.\n\n## 5. Percentage of plastic packaging that is refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable\n\nThe definitions of refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable  packaging  follow  the  definitions  of  the  Ellen Mc  Arthur  Foundation  described  in  the  document  '2023 Global  Commitment  Reporting  Guidelines'.  These  definitions are  taken  into  account  in  the  Group's  data management systems, which allow the respective quantities to be identified and  counted.  The  scope  of  this  indicator  is  all  primary  and secondary  plastic  packaging,  i.e.  any  packaging  containing more than 50% plastic by weight. Recyclability is assessed on",

The process  is  defined  and  explained  every  year  to  the  teams responsible. The percentage of eco-designed POS  is calculated in accordance with a self-declared statement from the suppliers trained in eco-design.\n\n## Eco-design of owned stores and points of sale\n\nScope of consolidation: the scope includes the Group's new or fully renovated  operated  stores worldwide.  The  period considered is from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nA  store  is  considered  eco-designed  if  the  eco-design  rate reaches 100% and/or if the store is LEED Gold certified. The ecodesign  rate  of  the  operated  stores  is  calculated  on  the basis  of  the  process  tracking  and  the  documentation  of  the Sustainable Retail  Box  checklist  and  according  to  a  selfdeclaration  of  compliance  of  the  points  of  sale,  unless  the store holds an external LEED certification.\n\nData :  at the time the data is compiled, each Country team is responsible for verifying the accuracy of all data communicated to the teams of each of the Zones. The teams monitoring  the  process  and  the  documentation  of  the Sustainable  Retail Box  checklist  are  trained  in  ecodesign. A  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place.\n\n## 4.5.2.2. Involving the Group's ecosystem in its transformation\n\n## Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation\n\nScope of consolidation : to define the list of strategic suppliers, the  spend  baseline  is  from  April  2023.  The  N-1  spend  is updated  at  the  end  of  November  for  indicators  related  to CDP  and  the  environmental  and  social  performance  of suppliers.\n\nData: Suppliers  participating  in  CDP  had  to  be  invited  in advance by L'Or\u00e9al according to defined criteria:\n\nCDP Climate Change :  In  2014,  participation  in  CDP  Climate Change programme  was  made  compulsory  for  all  strategic suppliers.  The  Group  also  invites  suppliers  that  are  strategic for a Zone or country.\n\nCDP  Water : L'Or\u00e9al  selects  suppliers  according  to  three criteria:  particularly  water-intensive  technology  or  activity; location  of  at  least  one  production  site  in  a  water-stressed catchment area; size of L'Or\u00e9al's purchasing volumes.\n\nCDP  Forests : L'Or\u00e9al  selects  suppliers  according  to  the impact  of  their  activity  on  deforestation.  Major  suppliers  of paper, palm oil and soy are invited to participate.\n\nClarification: no attempted bribery occurred this year during the social audits. The  concept  of  attempted  bribery mentioned in  the  audit  report  refers  to  an  attempt  to  bribe the  auditor  and  not  to  the  fact  that  the  supplier  may  have been involved in a bribery case.\n\n## People supported by L'Or\u00e9al's Inclusive Sourcing programme:\n\nScope  of  consolidation: the  period  considered  is  from 1 January to 31 December over a worldwide scope. This scope covers  workers  from  economically  or  socially  disadvantaged communities who work at the Group's suppliers and at their subcontractors.  The  programme  is  also  for  administrative staff  of  disadvantaged  suppliers:  companies  owned  and  led by disadvantaged communities (support for female entrepreneurship or companies owned and led by minorities (1) , veterans,  people  from  the  LGBTQIA+  community)  and  small companies facing large competitors in their market. Beneficiaries  of  the  programme  must  produce  materials, goods or services  purchased  by  L'Or\u00e9al.  At  least  one  of  the following  two  criteria  must  be  fulfilled:  access  to  and remaining in a permanent job if their community is generally excluded or under-represented in the activity, or a substantial and  lasting  improvement  in  income  thanks  to  the  activity associated with the programme (fair sourcing).\n\nData: in the majority of projects, the methodology is based on the number of FTEs under local regulations, on the basis of a full  year. The FTE number is proportional to L'Or\u00e9al's weight in  the  supplier's  business  activity,  i.e.  the  proportion  of  the supplier's payroll that is involved in the production of L'Or\u00e9al products. If the supplier's employees  work  for  other customers,  the  amount  of  the  orders  in  relation  to  the supplier's  total  revenue  determines  the  number  of  hours assigned to the L'Or\u00e9al production. For projects related to the sustainable sourcing  of  natural  raw  materials,  the  unit  of measurement of the beneficiaries is not FTE, but the number of  producers concerned. The supplier, with the assistance of an independent third party, defines a threshold at which the project has a significant impact on the target community with respect to the local situation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This scope covers people trained  on  beauty  skills  under  the Beauty  for  a  Better  Life programme  implemented  by  partner  organisations  between 1 January and 31 December.\n\nData : the managers  of  the  programme  at  L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries aggregate  the  data  on  the  basis  of  the information  and  a  declaration  of  compliance  transmitted  to them  by  the  partner  organisations.  The  Foundation  teams within the Department of Corporate Responsibility consolidate the data and check it for consistency.\n\n## People in very difficult social or economic situations who have benefited from beauty care and wellbeing treatments\n\nScope  of  consolidation: this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a France  scope  using  annual  data.  This  scope  covers  people who  have  benefitted  from  beauty  care  and  well-being treatments  under  the Beauty  for  a  Better  Life programme implemented by partner organisations between 1 January and 31 December.\n\nData: the  data  are  collected  by  the  programme's  partner organisations.  The  Foundation  teams  consolidate  the  data and check it for consistency\n\n## Beneficiaries of our brands' social engagement programmes\n\nScope  of  consolidation: this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a scope  limited  to  the  brands  that  have  social  engagement programmes. The scope excludes the  brands'  environmental programmes,  product  donations  and  awareness-raising media campaigns.\n\nData :  in  order  to  be  counted  for,  a  beneficiary  must  be  a person  who  is  either  supported  by  a  partner  NGO  with  a sustainable  impact, via,  for  example,  an  educational  grant, medical treatment, personalised psychological support, or any other initiative under the brand's social engagement programme;  or  supported  by  a  brand  via a learning programme  that  has  been  co-created  with  a  partner  NGO. The  data  are  approved  and  transmitted  by  the  NGOs,  then consolidated by the brands via a digital tool.\n\n## 4.5.3. Human Rights data\n\nScope of consolidation :  this  concerns  the  human  rights  data arising from ethics reporting. This scope is identical to that of social data.\n\nIndicators :  the  indicators  have  been  selected  in  line  with  the applicable  regulations,  and  to  enable  data  comparison,  in particular.\n\nData :  the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department  collects the  data  relating  to  ethics  and  human  rights  for  L'Or\u00e9al subsidiaries  using  the  Annual  Ethics Reporting  platform.\n\n## Displaying the environmental impact of products\n\nData :  the  data  for  the  defined  scope  is  collected  by  the Operations  Department  using  the  Sustainable  Product Optimisation Tool (SPOT). All SPOT exclusions also apply to this indicator.\n\n## 4.5.2.3. Contribute to solving global challenges\n\n## Supporting the most vulnerable women\n\nScope  of  consolidation: this  indicator  is  calculated  over  a worldwide scope using data accumulated since the Fund was launched. It is the number of organisations supported by the Fund,  the  number  of  women  directly  supported  by  these organisations with the assistance of the Fund, and the budget in  euros  L'Or\u00e9al  has  allocated  to  the  Fund  since  it  was launched.  This  amount  includes  the  costs  associated  with operating the Fund.\n\nData: data  are  collected  by  the  organisations  supported  by the  Fund  which  have  used  all  or  a  portion  of  the  budget allocated  during  the  reference  period.  The  Fund's  teams (within the Corporate Responsibility Department) consolidate the  data.  They  carry  out  consistency  checks  on  the  basis of  the  information  reported  and  a  certificate  of  compliance transmitted  by  the  partner  organisations.    The  budget allocated is monitored and consolidated by the Fund's teams in cooperation with L'Or\u00e9al's Finance team.\n\n## Contributing to the regeneration of nature\n\nRehabilitation: restoration  focuses  on  halting  and  reversing ecosystem  degradation  and  recovering  biodiversity.

Taxonomy data\n\nThe financial and technical information used for this analysis has  been  the  subject  of  additional  reporting  and  of  joint analysis and checking by the local and central teams for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Process  for  identifying  and  assessing  eligible  investments for 2023:\n\nThe  vast  majority  of  the  Group's  eligible  investments  (94%) correspond  to  data  relating  to  leases  that  have  been capitalised  in  accordance  with  IFRS  16.  The  Group's  other eligible  investments  (6%)  correspond  to  other  activities,  as described in the regulation tables. Solar panels are generally owned by the providers and rarely the subject of investments by the Group. They are therefore not included in the eligibility analysis  for  CapEx.  Eligible  investments  include  leases  that have been capitalised in accordance with IFRS 16, which relate to  A\u0113sop,  a  company  that  entered  the  Group's  scope  of consolidation at the beginning of September 2023.\n\nFor  individually  identified  and  reported  CapEx,  the  Financial Directors  of  each  Zone  have  identified  significant  eligible projects. The Group's financial tools are not, to date, capable of tracking investments according to the nomenclature of the activities  that  are  eligible  under  the  Taxonomy.  The  analysis was conducted using a threshold of work, so as to focus the analysis  on  the  most  significant  projects  linked  to  real investment amounts committed.\n\nIndividually  identified  CapEx  of  the  Operations  Department was  subject to self-assessment by the Finance and Operations Departments. The Group's financial tools are not, to  date,  capable  of  tracking  investments  according  to  the nomenclature  of  the  activities  that  are  eligible  under  the Taxonomy.  The  projects  were  identified  on  the  basis  of  the climate monitoring of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, using a threshold of work, so as to focus the analysis on the most significant projects.\n\nCapEx  linked  to  the  circular  economy  objective  have  been deemed not significant with the aid of interviews with subject experts,  projects  identified  on  the  basis  of  the  monitoring  of the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  and  by  management control  tools  used  by  the  Operations  Finance  Department.\n\nGroup  consolidated  OpEx  with  the  Taxonomy  Regulation denominator  are  defined  as  the  set  of  expenses  included  in operational profit.\n\nChecks  are  conducted  centrally  to  ensure  each  project  is eligible  and  to  ensure  that  the  same  project  is  not  counted twice when assessing Taxonomy indicators.\n\n## Process for qualifying aligned investments for 2023:\n\nThe alignment of capitalised leases under IFRS 16 relating to A\u0113sop  has  not  been  tested  in  view  of  the  entity's  recent integration.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  the  Delegated  Acts, an investment is qualified as 'aligned' to the Taxonomy, if it meets the three criteria below.\n\nThe  alignment  criteria  for  construction  and  renovation projects  undertaken  by  the  Group  are  analysed  solely  in  the year of final delivery in order to be able to assess the energy performance of the project with greater certainty.\n\n- 1. The technical criteria for substantial contribution broken down  by  the  activity:  Acquisition  and  ownership  of buildings (7.7)\n\n## In terms of the climate change mitigation objective:\n\nIn  terms  of  the  acquisition  of  buildings  constructed  before 31 December 2020 for which experts appointed by the Group do  not  have  the  buildings'  EPC (1) or  are  not  aware  of  the threshold  relating  to  the  top  15%  of  the  best  performing buildings in terms of primary energy consumption at national or regional level, the labels for which energy performance is a certification  criterion  and  for  which  the  maximum  level  of certification has been reached, the buildings in question have been considered, in the context of this transition exercise, as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  with  regard  to  the  Taxonomy.  The  buildings  are then considered highly likely to be among the best performing buildings in the country and the label should place the building in  the  top  15%  of  the  country  or  region.  If  the  label's  best score is not achieved, a case-by-case analysis is conducted.\n\nIn terms of the acquisition of buildings constructed after 2020 and  for  which  experts  appointed  by  the  Group  do  not  have the  buildings'  EPC,  buildings  with  labels  for  which  energy performance  is  a  certification  criterion  and  for  which  the maximum level of certification has been reached, have been considered,  in  the  context  of  this  transition  exercise,  as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  with  regard  to  the  Taxonomy.  The  experts  also ensure  that  the  other  technical  criteria  set  out  in  the Delegated  Acts  for  building  acquisitions  are  met  in  order  to qualify the alignment with the Taxonomy.\n\nWhere renovation or repairs that improve energy efficiency or equipment  for  renewable  energy  are  concerned,  the  Group ensures  that  the  work  complies  strictly  with  the  respective criteria laid down in the Delegated Acts for each activity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  application  of  this criterion  allows  the  CapEx  eligibility  validation  of  activities suited to that purpose.\n\n## 2. The  five  other  objectives  covered  by  the  Taxonomy (DNSH):\n\n## In terms of the climate change mitigation objective:\n\nAs far as DNSH is concerned, under the adaptation objective, an  external  organisation  has  conducted  the  exposure analyses  for  climate  change  adaptation  for  this  year.  These analyses  were  carried  out  according  to  scenarios  RCP  2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (1) with time horizons of 2040, 2050 and 2060,  and  the  hazards  described  in  Appendix  A  of  the delegated  regulation  on  the  objectives  of  climate  change mitigation and adaptation (2021/2139).  An initial inventory of adaptation solutions was drawn up in 2022 and continued in 2023.  Their  assessments  will  be  further  developed  during financial year 2024.\n\n## In terms of the climate change adaptation objective:\n\nEach project must comply with high standards in terms of the methodology used for the criteria of substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective.\n\n## In terms of these two climate objectives:\n\nEach project must do no harm to the other objectives included in the Taxonomy  Regulation:  water,  circular  economy, pollution  and  biodiversity.  The  DNSH  analyses  for  these objectives  are  conducted  on  the  basis  of  the  information available for each project and activity, in view of the criteria laid down by the Delegated Acts.\n\n## 3. Compliance with the 'minimum safeguards':\n\nThe  'minimum  social'  criteria  are  reviewed  centrally,  by  the Responsible Purchasing Departments and the Human Rights Department, in light of the requirements of the report on the minimum  safeguards  issued  by  the  Platform  on  Sustainable Finance (PSF). L'Or\u00e9al guarantees that procedures have been put  in  place  in  respect  of  the  four  themes  set  out  below. These  measures  are  considered  to  be  effective  if  (i)  no complaints have been lodged against the Group or against a L'Or\u00e9al  employee  or  (ii)  an  action  plan  is  implemented following  a  complaint  in  one  of  the  following  four  areas: respect  for  human  rights  (including  consumer  rights),  anticorruption practices, tax policy implemented, raising administrative staff awareness  of  the importance of complying with all applicable laws and regulations in the field of competition law.",

Report of one of the Statutory Auditors, appointed as independent third party, on the verification of the consolidated non-financial performance statement\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2023\n\nThis is  a  free  English  translation  of  the  report  by  one  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  issued  in  French  and  is  provided  solely  for  the convenience of English-speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris\n\nTo the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\nIn  our  capacity  as  Statutory  Auditor  of  your  company  L'Or\u00e9al  (hereinafter  the  'Entity'),  appointed  as  independent  third  party ('third  party'),  accredited  by  the  French  Accreditation  Committee  (Cofrac),  under  number  3-1886  (Cofrac  Inspection Accreditation, scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical  information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the Entity's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement', respectively), presented in the Group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed  as described in the section 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial  statement is not prepared in accordance  with  the  applicable  regulatory  provisions  and  that  the  Information,  taken  as  a  whole,  is  not  fairly  presented  in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement and available on the Entity's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation the Information\n\nThe Information  may  be  subject  to  uncertainty  inherent  to  the  state  of  scientific  and  economic  knowledge  and  the  quality  of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in section \"4.5 Methodological notes\" of the Group management report.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nManagement of L'Or\u00e9al is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting or establishing suitable criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- \u00b7 preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies,  including  key  performance  indicators  and  the  information  set-out  in  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  (Green taxonomy);\n- \u00b7 preparing the Statement by applying the Entity's 'Guidelines' as referred above; and\n- \u00b7 implementing such internal control  as  it  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  Information  that  is  free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by applying the Entity's Guidelines as referred to above.",

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures  aimed  at  ensuring  compliance  with  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  ethical  requirements  and  the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur  work  engaged  the  skills  of  nine  people  between  September  2023  and  February  2024  over  a  total  intervention  period  of around twenty-four weeks.\n\nTo assist us in conducting our work, we referred to our corporate social responsibility and sustainable development experts. We conducted around thirty  interviews  with  people  responsible  for  preparing  the  Statement,  representing  in  particular  Corporate Social Responsibility, Legal Affairs, Ethics and Risk Management, Human Resources, Environment, Health and Safety, Research, Innovation and Technology, Environment and Purchasing departments.\n\nThis  work involved the use of information and communication technologies allowing the work and interviews to be carried out remotely, without hindering the good execution of the verification process.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures conducted in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the main risks associated;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in section III of Article L. 225-102-1, as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anticorruption and tax avoidance legislation, and  includes,  where  applicable,  an  explanation  for  the  absence  of  the  information  required  under  Article  L.225-102-1  III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the main risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Concerning certain risks or information (human resources, environment, health and safety, human rights, social, etc.), our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, while for other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code, with the limits specified in the Statement.\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Entity and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information.\n- \u00b7 For the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important listed in Appendix 1, we implemented:\n- \u00b7 analytical  procedures  that  consisted  in  verifying  the  proper  consolidation  of  collected  data  as  well  as  the  consistency  of changes there to;\n- \u00b7 tests  of  details,  using  sampling  techniques,  in  order  to  verify  the  proper  application  of  definitions  and  procedures  and reconcile the data with supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities presented in Appendix 2 and covers between 21% and 30% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance review are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 16, 2024 One of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid Dupont-No\u00ebl\n\nCatherine Saire\n\nPartner, Audit\n\nPartner, Sustainability Services",

Reasonable assurance report of the Statutory Auditors on a selection of consolidated social, societal and environmental information for the year ended 31 December, 2023\n\nThis  is  a  free  translation  into  English  of  the  original  report  issued  in  the  French  language  and  it  is  provided  solely  for  the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nYear ended 31 December, 2023\n\nTo the chairman of the Board,\n\nIn  our  quality  as  Statutory  Auditors  of  your  Company  (hereafter  'Entity')  and  further  to  your  request,  we  have  undertaken  a reasonable assurance engagement on a selection of consolidated social, societal and environmental information (hereinafter, the 'Information'), that the Entity has chosen to prepare in accordance with its protocols (hereinafter, the 'Guidelines'), detailed in annex and in L'Or\u00e9al Group Universal Registration Document for the year ended on 31 December 2023.\n\n## Opinion in the form of reasonable assurance\n\nIn our opinion, the Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently,  the  Information  need  to  be  read  and  understood  together  with  the  Guidelines,  available  on  request  at  the headquarters of the Entity.\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nAs stated in the Universal Registration Document, the Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific or  economic  knowledge  and  the  quality  of  external  data  used.  Some  information  is  sensitive  to  the  methodological  choices, assumptions, and/or estimates used in their preparation.\n\n## Entity's responsibility\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Entity to:\n\n- \u00b7 select or establish appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- \u00b7 prepare the Information in accordance with the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 design, implement and maintain the internal control procedures it deems necessary to ensure that the Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been endorsed by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditors\n\n## Our responsibility is:\n\n- \u00b7 to  plan  and  prepare  the  engagement  to  obtain  a  reasonable  assurance  that  the  Information  is  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 to express an independent opinion based on the evidence we have obtained;\n- \u00b7 to communicate our opinion to the chairman of the Board of the Entity.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on the entire Universal Registration Document for the year ended on the 31 December 2023 or on the compliance with other applicable legal provisions.\n\n## Professional standards applied\n\nOur work was carried out in accordance with the international guidance ISAE 3000 (revised) standard \"Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" published by the IAASB (International Auditing and Assurance Standard Board).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  nature,  timing,  and  extent  of  the  procedures  selected  are  within  our  professional  judgment,  particularly  our evaluation  of  the  risks  that  the  Information  contains  significant  misstatements,  whether  they  result  from  fraud  or  error.  In assessing these risks, we have taken into account the relevant internal control for the preparation of the Information by the Entity. We also :\n\n- \u00b7 assessed  the  suitability  of  the  Guidelines  in  terms  of  its  relevance,  comprehensiveness,  reliability,  neutrality  and understandability by taking into consideration, if relevant, the best practices of the industry;\n- \u00b7 performed, on the Information:\n- \u00b7 analytical procedures to verify the correct consolidation of the collected data as well as the consistency of their evolutions;\n- \u00b7 detailed tests based on samples, to check the correct application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out with a selection of contributing entities listed below:\n- - for the selected social and societal Information: the headquarters of the entity that centralizes all information;\n- - for the selected environmental Information: Belgium (Libramont), China (Suzhou, SA Shanghai SHN, SA Shanghai Jinghua, Yichang, SA Guanghzou), Egypt (Cairo), France (Rambouillet, Tours, Lassigny, Caudry, R&I Episkin, SA Aulnay), Germany (Karlsruhe),  India  (Baddi,  Pune),  Indonesia  (Jakarta),  Italy  (Settimo,  DC  Villantero,  SA  Italy),  Kenya  (Nairobi),  Mexico (Mexico),  Poland  (Warsaw),  South  Africa  (Midrand,  DC  ZAF  Centurion),  Spain  (Madrid,  SA  Spain),  and  United  States (Franklin, Piscataway, North Little Rock) representing 58% of Group activity (in units of finished goods reviewed).

Accounting principles\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its subsidiaries  ('the  Group')  published  for  2023,  have  been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),  as  adopted  in  the  European  Union  as  of 31 December 2023.\n\nOn  8  February  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  closed  the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2023. The financial statements will not become final until they have been approved by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to be held on 23 April 2024.\n\nThe Group did not anticipate any standards or interpretations not mandatorily applicable in 2023.\n\nEstablished by the OECD and transposed in December 2023 in  France,  the  Pillar  2  global  tax  reform  aims  to  establish  a minimum  taxation  of  multinational  groups  at  15%  and  is applicable from the 2024 financial year. After analysis of the texts as stand current regulations and their consequences, the financial impact of this reform should be insignificant, due in particular  to  the  consistency  between  the  Group's  tax footprint and its operational and geographic footprint.\n\nIn  May  2023,  the  IASB  amended  IAS  12  Income  Taxes  by introducing  a  temporary  exception  to  the  recognition  of deferred  taxes  arising  from  the  Pillar  2  reform.  The  European Union  adopted  these  amendments  on  9  November  2023.  The Group has implemented this exception as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## 1.1. Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with international accounting standards requires that  the  Group  make  a  certain  number  of  estimates  and assumptions that may affect the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, equity and net profit (loss).\n\nThese  estimates  and  assumptions  mainly  concern  the measurement  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets, operating  lease  terms,  provisions,  non-current  tax  liabilities, pension obligations, deferred taxes and share-based payments.  Estimates  used  by  the  Group  in  relation  to  these different  areas  are  made  based  on  information  available when the accounts are prepared and are described in detail in each specific associated note.\n\n## 1.2. Scope and methods of consolidation\n\nAll  companies  included  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  have  a financial year ending 31 December or close their accounts on that date.\n\nAll  companies  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  the  parent company L'Or\u00e9al have been fully consolidated.\n\nGroup  companies  that  are  jointly  controlled  with  a  limited number of other shareholders under a contractual agreement are consolidated under the equity method in accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAssociates  over  which  the  Group  has  a  significant  influence have been accounted for by the equity method.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3. Translation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at  closing  exchange  rates.  Income  statement  items  are translated at average exchange rates for the year.\n\nThe resulting translation difference attributable to the Group is  entered  directly  under  equity  under  the  item Cumulative translation  adjustments , while  the  translation  difference attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  is  recognised  under the Non-controlling interests item.\n\n## Devaluation of the Argentine Peso for the 2023 financial year\n\nOn  13  December  2023,  the  Argentine  government  and  the Central  Bank  of  Argentina  modified  their  exchange  control system  with  the  aim  of  stabilizing  the  economy  plagued  by inflation. The official devalued rate as of 31 December 2023 is 894.98 ARS for one Euro (compared to 189.34 ARS for one Euro at the end of 2022).\n\n## Note 2. Main events of the period\n\n## 2.1. Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\n## 2.1.1. Year 2023\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn  3  April,  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  that  it  had  signed  an agreement with Natura & Co to acquire A\u0113sop, the Australian luxury beauty brand, for $2.6 billion (representing \u20ac2.4 billion at the rate of the acquisition date). Created in 1987, A\u0113sop is a  global  super  brand  known  for  its  skin,  hair  and  body products, available across luxury retail, beauty and hospitality locations  around  the  world.  Aesop  operates  online  and  in around  400  exclusive  points  of  sale  across  the  Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia, with a nascent footprint in China where the first store opened in 2022.\n\nThis acquisition was completed on 30 August 2023 and has been fully consolidate since that date.\n\nIn  2023,  this  acquisition  represented  \u20ac557.5  million  in  fullyear net sales and \u20ac13.1 million in full-year operating profit.\n\nThe  provisional  allocation  of  the  purchase  price  led  to  the recognition of goodwill of \u20ac1,682.3 million and is as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions            | Fair value at the date of acquisition   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets (1) | 580.9                                   |\n| Other assets          | 428.4                                   |\n| Cash                  | 74.8                                    |\n| Other liabilities     | -415.3                                  |\n| A\u0113sop net assets      | 668.8                                   |\n| Goodwill              | 1,682.3                                 |\n| ACQUISITION PRICE     | 2,351.1                                 |\n\n## 1.4. Valuation of goodwill in foreign currencies\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  foreign  companies  is  considered  to form part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign company, and is therefore expressed in the entity's functional currency and translated using the closing exchange rates in effect at the  closing  date.  Goodwill  recorded  before  1  January  2004 continues to be recorded in euros.\n\nOn  4  December  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  completed  the  acquisition  of Lactobio,  a  leading  probiotic  and  microbiome  research company  based  in  Copenhagen  (Denmark).  The  strategic acquisition  builds  on  20  years  of  advanced  research  by L'Or\u00e9al into the microbiome scientific territory, deepening its knowledge  of  the  microorganisms  that  live  on  the  skin's surface  and  reinforcing  the  Groupe's  leadership  in  this  field. The  acquisition  also  opens  up  new  scientific  opportunities, including  leveraging  Lactobio's  microbiome  expertise  and significant  IP  portfolio  to  develop  safe  and  effective  new cosmetic solutions using live bacteria.\n\nThe cost of these new acquisitions represented \u20ac2,401.8  million.  The  total  amount  of  goodwill  and  other intangible assets resulting from their acquisitions provisionally amounted to \u20ac2,313.9 million.\n\n## 2.1.2. Year 2022\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn  23  September  2022,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  an  agreement  to acquire  Skinbetter  Science,  a  physician-dispensed  American skincare  brand  backed  by  cutting-edge,  dermatological science,  combining  patented  efficacious  ingredients  with luxurious sensorial textures.\n\nSkinbetter Science was co-founded in 2016 by pharmaceutical industry  professionals,  Jonah  Shacknai,  Justin  Smith  and Seth  Rodner,  and  has  since  become  one  of  the  fastest growing  medical-dispensed  skincare  brands  in  the  United States. Skinbetter Science is known for formulating innovative products  with  active  ingredients  for  anti-aging,  moisturizing, cleansing,  exfoliating,  skin  peeling  and  sun  protection.  The brand  is  strongly  supported  by  deep  knowledge  of  skin  and chemistry with clinical trials led by board-certified dermatologists.\n\nSkinbetter Science's products are mainly available through a network of leading dermatology, plastic surgery and medical aesthetics  practices  throughout  the  United  States,  powered by a national medical sales team.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  total  amount  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets resulting from its acquisition amounted to \u20ac833.1 million.\n\nIn 2022, this acquisition represented \u20ac105.9 million in full-year net sales and \u20ac18.7 million in full-year operating profit.\n\n## 2.1.3. Year 2021\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn  1  February  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  finalised  the  acquisition  of Takami Co. This company develops and markets under licence products  from  the  Takami  skincare  brand;  owned  by  Dr. Hiroshi Takami, the founder of the two eponymous dermatology clinics in Tokyo. Mainly available in Japan and in some Asian countries, notably in China.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  renewed  the  brand  licensing agreement with Dr. Takami for a very long period and signed a collaboration agreement with the Takami clinics. Takami will be integrated into the L'Or\u00e9al Luxe Division.\n\nIn 2021, the acquisition of Takami represented \u20ac54.4 million in full-year  net  sales  and  -\u20ac7.7  million  in  full-year  operating profit.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, L'Or\u00e9al signed an agreement to acquire Youth to the People ,  a  skincare company based in California inspired by superfood.\n\nYouth to the People develops and markets high-performance skincare products  known  for  innovative  formulas  that combine  premium  vegan  blends  of  superfood  extracts  and science.\n\nAvailable in the US, Canada, Australia and in select European countries  where  it  enjoys  a  very  strong  appeal,  the  brand  is marketed through an omnichannel distribution - mix of D2C e-commerce and selective distribution.\n\nThe  brand  will  be  integrated  into  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  Division.  In 2021, Youth to the People is expected to record over $50 million of  sales.  This  acquisition  was  completed  on  29  December  2021 and has been fully consolidated since that date.\n\nThe cost of these acquisitions represented \u20ac524.3 million. The total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from their acquisitions amounted to \u20ac507,7 million (of which \u20ac336.7  million  of  intangible  assets  related  to  Youth  to  the People).\n\n## Sale\n\nOn 31 March 2021, L'Or\u00e9al finalised the sale of the Cosmeurop production site, located in Strasbourg, France to the Superga group.\n\n## 2.2. Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation in the cash flow statement\n\nFor 2023, these changes mainly related to A\u0113sop acquisition.\n\nFor  2022,  these  changes  related  to  Skinbetter  Science acquisition.\n\nFor  2021,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Takami  and Youth to the People acquisitions.\n\n## 2.3. Transaction on share capital\n\nOn  7  December  2021,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Board  of  Directors approved a strategic transaction consisting of the repurchase by  L'Or\u00e9al,  as  part  of  its  share  buyback  programme,  of 22.26 million of its own shares - representing 4% of its capital -from  Nestl\u00e9. The  total price paid to Nestl\u00e9 was \u20ac8.904 billion.\n\nAll  shares  redeemed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  have  been  bought  back  for the express purpose of cancelling them. The transaction had a marginally  accretive  impact  on  the  diluted  net  earnings  per share in 2021, given that the shares were repurchased at the end of 2021, but had a full-year accretive impact of at least 4% for the 2022 financial year.\n\nThis transaction led the Group to take out a bridging loan of \u20ac1.9 billion  and  issue  commercial  paper  for  \u20ac2.3  billion,  with the  balance  financed  by  the  cash  available  at  31  December 2021. These loans were fully repaid in 2022.",

Operating items - Segment information\n\n## Accounting Principles\n\n## Net sales\n\nNet  sales  are  recognised  when  the  goods  have  been transferred to the customer.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts  and  product  returns  are deducted  from  net  sales,  as  are  incentives  granted  to distributors  or  consumers resulting in a cash outflow, such as commercial cooperation, coupons, discounts and loyalty programmes.\n\nIncentives granted  to  distributors  or  consumers  are recognised as a deduction from sales: the service cannot be separated  from  the  product  sales  transaction  or  it  is  not possible to reasonably estimate the fair value of the cost of the service.\n\nSales incentives, cash discounts, provisions for returns and incentives granted to customers are recorded simultaneously to the recognition of the sales if they can be estimated in a reasonably reliable manner, based mainly on statistics  compiled  from  past  experience  and  contractual conditions.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe  cost  of  goods  sold  consists  mainly  of  the  industrial production  cost  of  products  sold,  the  cost  of  distributing products to customers including freight and delivery costs, either  directly  or  indirectly  through  depots,  inventory impairment costs, and royalties paid to third parties.\n\n## Research and innovation expenses\n\nExpenditure  during  the  research  phase  is  charged  to  the income  statement  for  the  financial  year  during  which  it  is incurred.\n\nExpenses  incurred during the innovation phase  are recognised  as Intangible  assets only  if  they  meet  all  the following criteria set out in IAS 38:\n\n- \u00b7 the  project  is  clearly  defined  and  the  related  costs  are separately identified and reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical feasibility of the project has been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the  intention  and  ability  to  complete  the  project  and  to use  or  sell  the  products  resulting  from  the  project  have been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  project  and  to use or sell it are available;\n- \u00b7 the Group can demonstrate that the project will generate probable future economic benefits, as the existence of a potential  market  for  the  production  resulting  from  the project, or its internal usefulness has been demonstrated.\n\nIn view of the very large number of innovation projects and uncertainties  concerning  the  decision  to  launch  products relating  to  these  projects,  L'Or\u00e9al  considers  that  some  of these capitalisation criteria are not met.\n\n## Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nThese expenses consist mainly of expenses relating to the advertisement and promotion of products to customers and consumers. They are charged to the income statement for the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nThese expenses relate mainly to sales teams and sales team management, marketing teams and administrative services,  as  well  as  general  expenses  and  the  costs  and expenses of free shares.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit consists of gross profit less  research  and innovation  expenses,  advertising  and  promotion  expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded on the balance sheet at their purchase price. They are not remeasured.\n\nAssets financed by lease contracts are recognised as assets on  the  balance  sheet  under Right-of-use assets.  The corresponding debt is recognised as a liability under Lease debt .\n\nInvestment subsidies are recorded as liabilities under Other current liabilities .\n\nThe  components  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are recorded  separately  if  their  estimated  useful  lives,  and therefore their depreciation periods, are materially different.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  using  the straight-line method, over the following useful lives:\n\n| Buildings                                       | 10-40 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Industrial machinery and equipment              | 5-15 years    |\n| Point-of-sales advertising: stands and displays | 3 years       |\n| Other property, plant and equipment             | 3-10 years    |\n\nDepreciation  and  impairment  losses  are  recorded  in  the income statement according to the use of the asset.\n\nIn  view  of  their  nature,  property,  plant  and  equipment  are considered to have a value of zero at the end of the useful lives indicated above.\n\n## Leases\n\nAll leases are recognised using a single model consisting of recording lease liabilities as liabilities (amount of discounted future payments) and rights of use as assets.\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable term of each  contract  and  includes  any  renewal  options  that  the Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise,  particularly  if  the estimated  useful  life  of  the  fittings  in  which  the  Group invested  initially  or  during  the  lifetime  of  the  contract exceeds the initial contractual life. In the case of termination options subject to a short notice period, these options have not been taken into account in the assessment of the lease terms.\n\n<!-- image -->",

French lease rights are not amortised.\n\nThe  discount  rate  used  to  value  the  lease  liability corresponds to the annual rate for each contract calculated using  zero-coupon  rates  obtained  by  currency  and  by maturity tranche, increased by the Group's credit spread.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded during the initial recognition.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.  Cost  is  calculated  using  the  weighted  average  cost method.\n\nA  provision is made  for  obsolete  and  slow-moving inventories  on  the  basis  of  their  probable  net  realisable value, estimated on the basis of historic and projected data.\n\n## 3.1. Segment information\n\n## 3.1.1. Information by business segment\n\nThe  Group's  business  activities  are  organised  into  four Divisions.  In  its  markets,  each  Operational  Division  develops and enhances a range of its own brand of consumer products:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Professional  Products  Division  provides  expertise  to beauty professionals.\n- For  over  100  years,  this  Division  has  acquired  extensive knowledge of, and provided tailored support solutions for, the  hairdressing  sector.  It  has  built  up  a  unique  brand portfolio  which  currently  includes L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel, K\u00e9rastase, Redken, Matrix and PureOlogy ;\n- \u00b7 the  Consumer  Products  Division's  goal  is  to  democratise access to the best that the world of beauty has to offer.\n- The  Division  is  underpinned  by  four  major  global  brands ( L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  Garnier,  Maybelline  New  York  and  NYX Professional  Makeup ), and  by  the  deployment  of  its specialised  and  regional  brands  ( Stylenanda,  Essie,  Mixa, etc .);\n- \u00b7 the  Luxe  Division  creates  exceptional  experiences  and products,  for  the  most  demanding  consumers  in  selective distribution.\n\nWEIGHT OF NET SALES BY DIVISION OVER THE THREE PERIODS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trade accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable from customers are recorded at their nominal value, which corresponds to their fair value.\n\nThe current trade accounts receivable impairment methodology at L'Or\u00e9al reflects the level of expected losses on  the  customer  portfolio,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  past statistics  from  the  outset  of  the  receivable.  Moreover,  this risk  is  contained  thanks  to  the  credit  insurance  policy applied by the Group.\n\nExcept when local conditions do not allow it, the Group has insurance cover for the subsidiaries.\n\n- \u00b7 the  Division  has  built  a  unique  portfolio  of  prestigious brands including iconic mainstream, aspirational, alternative and specialist brands (Lanc\u00f4me, Kiehl's, Giorgio Armani  Beauty,  Yves  Saint  Laurent  Beaut\u00e9,  Biotherm, Helena Rubinstein, Shu Uemura, IT Cosmetics, Urban Decay, Ralph Lauren, Mugler, Viktor&Rolf, Valentino, Azzaro, Prada, Takami, A\u0113sop etc.);\n- \u00b7 the  Dermatological  Beauty  Division,  whose  goal  is  to  help everyone in their quest to have healthy and beautiful skin.\n- Its  portfolio  of  highly  complementary  brands  ( La  RochePosay,  Vichy,  CeraVe,  SkinCeuticals,  Skinbetter  Science, etc. )  is  designed  to  keep  pace  with  major  skincare  trends and recommendations of healthcare professionals.\n\nThe  'non-allocated'  item  includes  expenses  incurred  by  the Functional  Divisions,  fundamental  research  and  the  cost  of free shares not allocated to the Divisions. It also includes noncore businesses, such as reinsurance.\n\nThe performance of each Division is measured on the basis of operating profit.",

Any  write-offs  of  fixed  assets  or  impairment charged  against  inventories  and  other  assets  related directly  to  these  restructuring  measures  are  also  recorded as restructuring costs.\n\n## Operational profit\n\nOperational  profit  is  calculated  based  on  operating  profit and  includes  other  income  and  expenses  such  as  capital gains  and  losses  on  disposals  of  property,  plant,  and equipment and intangible assets, impairment of assets, and restructuring costs.\n\nThis item breaks down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                       |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Capital gains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (1) |   -6.7 |   -7.4 |   -0.4 |\n| Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (2)                            | -270.6 |  -39   | -337.5 |\n| Restructuring costs (3)                                                                          |  -88.5 | -172.6 | -149.6 |\n| Other (4)                                                                                        |  -84.1 |  -22.5 |   55.5 |\n| TOTAL                                                                                            | -449.9 | -241.5 | -432   |\n\n## (1) Including:\n\n- -in 2023, the residual impact of the sale of Logocos in Germany (-\u20ac5 million);\n- -in 2022, mainly the capital loss (-\u20ac8.8 million) on the assets disposal of Dermablend in the United States.\n\n## (2) Including:\n\n- -in 2023, the impairment of the goodwill of IT Cosmetics (\u20ac250 million) and that of the brand Decl\u00e9or(\u20ac20 million);\n- -in 2022, the impairment of the brand Decl\u00e9or (-\u20ac39 million);\n- -in 2021, the goodwill of IT Cosmetics (-\u20ac254,7 million) and the brand Magic (-\u20ac82,8 million).\n\n## (3) Including:\n\n- -in  2023,  the  restructuring  of  the  organisation  and  distribution  of  the  Consumer  Products  and  Professional  Products  Divisions  in  Europe  (\u20ac39  million),  the strategic  reorganisation  of  legal  entities  in  France  (\u20ac17  million),  the  recognition  following  French  pension  reforms  of  additional  charges  on  advanced  leave provisions from previous restructuring (\u20ac7 million) and additional impairment concerning the right to use in Brazil (\u20ac9 million);\n- -in 2022, mainly the loss resulting from the sale of Logocos for \u20ac114.6 million following the signing of an agreement on 2 December 2022 (this project should be completed by March 2023), the continued restructuring of the sales forces in the Consumer Products Division in Europe (\u20ac14.5 million) and the reorganisation of the operational structures in Europe and Sapmena (\u20ac23.1 million);\n- -in 2021, the ongoing restructuring of the organisation and distribution of the Luxe and Professional Divisions in Europe (\u20ac60.8 million), the reorganisation of the Consumer Products Division's sales forces in North Asia (\u20ac29 million), the restructuring of an industrial activity in Eastern Europe (\u20ac10 million), the restructuring of production in Germany (\u20ac18.2 million) and the reorganisation of Urban Decay's distribution structures in 17 countries (\u20ac9.2 million).\n\n## (4) Including:\n\n- -in 2023, corporate philanthropy donations (\u20ac29 million) and acquisition costs (\u20ac46 million);\n- -in  2022,  corporate  philanthropy  donations  (\u20ac25.3  million),  exceptional  costs  associated  with  the  conflict  in  Ukraine  (\u20ac18.4  million),  partially  offset  by  the downward revaluation of earn-out liabilities (\u20ac21.2 million);\n- -in 2021, the reversal of a provision for disputes related to intellectual property (\u20ac45.6 million), the write-down of Earn-out Style Nanda and Atelier Cologne earnout debts (\u20ac44.2 million), partially offset by charitable donations (\u20ac16 million) and acquisition costs (\u20ac14.3 million).",

Post-employment benefits, termination benefits and other long-term employee benefits\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  Group  operates  pension,  early  retirement  and  other employee  benefit  schemes  depending  on  local  legislation and regulations.\n\nFor obligatory state schemes and other definedcontribution  schemes,  the  Group  recognises  in  the  income statement  contributions  payable  when  they  are  due.  No provision has been set aside in this respect as the Group's obligation does not exceed the amount of contributions paid\n\nThe characteristics of the defined benefit schemes in force within the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 French regulations provide for specific length-of-service awards  payable  to  employees  on  retirement.  An  early retirement  plan  and  a  defined  benefit  plan  have  also been  set  up.  In  some  Group  companies  there  are  also measures providing for the payment of certain healthcare costs for retired employees. These obligations are  partially  funded  by  an  external  fund,  except  those relating to healthcare costs for retired employees;\n- \u00b7 for foreign subsidiaries with employee retirement schemes or other specific obligations relating to defined benefit  plans,  the  excess  of  the  projected  benefit obligation over the scheme's assets is also recognised by setting  up  a  provision  for  charges  on  the  basis  of  the actuarial value of employees' vested rights.\n\nThe charges recorded in the income statement during the year include:\n\n- \u00b7 additional rights vested by employees  during  the accounting period;\n- \u00b7 the impact of any change to existing schemes on previous years or of any new schemes;\n- \u00b7 the change in the value of the discounted rights over the past year;\n- \u00b7 income on external funds calculated on the basis of the discount rate applied to the benefit obligation.\n\nThe  latter  two  items  represent  the  interest  component  of the pension costs. The interest component is shown within Net  financial  income  on  the  Other  financial  income  and expenses item.\n\nTo  determine  the  discounted  value  of  the  obligation  for each  scheme,  the  Group  applies  an  actuarial  valuation method  based  on  the  final  salary  (projected  unit  credit method). The obligations and the fair value of plan assets are assessed  each  year  using  length-of-service,  life expectancy,  staff  turnover  by  category  and  economic assumptions (such as inflation rate and discount rate).\n\nThe  Group  applies  a  simplified  granular  approach  to calculate its service cost for the period. Under this simplified approach,  two  different  discount  rates  are  used  to calculate  the  obligation  and  the  service  cost  based  on  the duration of the future cash flows relating to each of these items.  Financial  costs  are  calculated  by  applying  the discount rate used for the obligation to plan assets and by applying the differential interest rate to service cost for the period.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  on  post-employment defined benefit obligations are recognised in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses in relation to other benefits such as jubilee awards and long-serve bonuses are immediately charged to the income statement.\n\nThe  liability  corresponding  to  the  Company's  net  defined benefit obligation regarding its employees is recorded in the balance  sheet  on the  Provisions  for  employee  retirement obligations and related benefits line .",

Income tax\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  income  tax  charge  includes  the  current  tax  expense payable  by  each  consolidated  tax  entity  and  the  deferred tax expense. Deferred tax is calculated whenever there are temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and  their  basis  for  consolidated  accounting purposes, using the balance sheet liability method.\n\nThe  restatement  of  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  lease contracts results in the booking of deferred tax.\n\nDeferred  tax  includes  irrecoverable  taxation  on  estimated or confirmed dividends.\n\nDeferred tax is measured using the tax rate enacted at the closing date and which will also apply when the temporary differences reverse.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  generated  by  tax  loss  carryforwards are  only  recognised  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  the entities will be able to generate taxable profit against which they can be utilised.\n\nUnder the French system of tax consolidation, the taxable profits of some  French  companies  are  offset  when determining the overall tax charge, which is payable only by L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  tax  Group.  Tax consolidation systems also exist outside France.\n\nUncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet under Non-current  tax  liabilities .

Goodwill\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  by  the  purchase method.  The  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  of the  Company  acquired  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the acquisition date. Any valuation differences identified when the  acquisition  is  carried  out  are  recorded  under  the corresponding asset and liability items.\n\nAny residual difference between the cost of an acquisition and the  Group's  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  identified assets  and  liabilities  is  recorded  as  Goodwill  and  allocated to the Cash Generating Units expected to benefit from the acquisition or the related synergies.\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  the  acquisition  of  an  associate  is presented in the Investments in associates item.\n\nFor business combinations carried out after 1 January 2010, the  main  changes  with  regard  to  previously  applicable accounting principles are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 for  each  acquisition,  the  Group  chooses  whether  to recognise  the  full  amount  of  goodwill  regardless  of  the ownership  interest  acquired,  or  an  amount  of  goodwill corresponding  to  its  interest  in  the  acquired  company (previously the only method allowed);\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets recognised after the initial accounting is complete are included in profit or loss, and in contrast to previous practices, the amount of goodwill that  would  have  been  recorded  had  the  deferred  tax asset  been  recognised  as  an  identifiable  asset  at  the acquisition date is not deducted;\n- \u00b7 costs  incurred  in  respect  of  a  business  combination  are now expensed and no longer included in the acquisition cost;\n- \u00b7 the acquisition cost, which includes contingent consideration, is recognised and  measured  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value.  Subsequent  changes  in  fair value, affecting in particular the contingent consideration recorded in liabilities, are recognised in Other income and expenses in the income statement and no longer treated as an adjustment to goodwill;\n- \u00b7 any  previous  interest  held  in  the  acquiree  prior  to  the date  control  was  obtained  is  now  remeasured  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value,  with  the  corresponding  gain or  loss  on  remeasurement  recognised  on  the  income statement;\n- \u00b7 purchase commitments  for minority interests are recognised  in  financial  debt  at  the  acquisition-date  fair value. Subsequent  changes  in  fair value of the commitment are recognised by adjusting equity.",

Other intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nIntangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost. Intangible  assets  identified  following  an  acquisition  as  well as internally generated intangible assets are also included in this item.\n\n## a) Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThey mainly consist  of  brands,  customer  relationships  and formulas and patents.\n\nWith  regard  to  brands,  the  use  of  the  'discounted  cash flow' method is preferred to enable the value in use to be monitored  more  easily  following  the  acquisition.  Two approaches have been adopted to date:\n\n- \u00b7 premium-based approach: this method involves estimating the portion of future cash flows that could be generated by the brand, compared with the future cash flows that the activity could generate without the brand;\n- \u00b7 royalty-based  approach:  this  involves  estimating  the value of the brand by referencing the levels of royalties demanded  for  the  use  of  similar  brands.  It  is  based  on sales forecasts drawn up by the Group.\n\nThese approaches are based on a qualitative analysis of the brand in order to ensure that the assumptions selected are relevant. The discount rate used is based on the weighted average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  target  acquired. Terminal growth rates are consistent with available market data  (generally  2.5%  for  Europe  and  3.0%  for  the  rest  of the world, except in specific cases).\n\nA brand may have a finite or an indefinite useful life span.\n\nLocal  brands  which  are  to  be  gradually  replaced  by  an international brand already existing within the Group have a finite useful life span.\n\nThey are amortised over their useful lives  as  estimated  at the date of acquisition.\n\nInternational brands are brands which have an indefinite life span. They are tested for impairment at least once a year during the fourth quarter, and whenever an adverse event occurs.\n\nAdverse  events  may  result  among  other  things  from  an increase  in  market  interest  rates  or  from  a  decrease  in actual net sales or operational  profit compared  to forecasts.\n\nThe impairment test consists of calculating the recoverable amount of the brand based on the model adopted when the acquisition took place.\n\nCustomer  relationships  refer  to  relations  developed  with customers  either  through  contractual  arrangements  or  by non-contractual means through constant revenue streams resulting from the target's competitive position or reputation in its market.\n\nThe  useful  life  of  a  customer  relationship  is  limited  and varies depending on the estimated attrition rate of existing customers at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThe  Group  may  decide  to  identify  and  value  patents  and formulas that it intends to develop.\n\nThe value of a patent or a formula is assessed on the basis of  the  future  profits  expected  from  its  ownership  in  the future, in accordance with the royalty-based approach.\n\nThe amortisation period applicable to patents corresponds to the period during which they enjoy legal protection.\n\n## b) Internally generated intangible assets\n\nThese mainly consist of software.\n\nInnovation costs of software for internal use are capitalised for the programming, coding and testing phases. The costs of substantial updates and upgrades resulting in additional functions are also capitalised.\n\nCapitalised  innovation  costs  are  amortised  from  the  date the software is made available in the entity concerned and over its probable useful life, which, in most cases, is between five and eight years.",

It is tested for impairment at least once  a  year  during  the  fourth  quarter  or  whenever  an adverse  event  occurs.  Adverse  events  may  result  among other  things  from  an  increase  in  market  interest  rates  or from  a  decrease  in  actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit compared to forecasts.\n\nImpairment tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of assets including goodwill and brands with the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit. A Cash Generating Unit corresponds to one or more worldwide brands. A Cash Generating  Unit  can  contain  several  brands  in  case  of similar  marketing  position  or  depending  on  organisational criteria  and  particularly  when  distribution  circuits  and commercial/management structures are pooled. Recoverable  values  are  determined  on  the  basis  of discounted operating cash flow forecasts covering a period of  10  years  (the  period  considered  necessary  for  the strategic positioning of an acquisition) and a terminal value.\n\nThe  cash  flows  are  determined  in  the  currencies  of  the countries in question and are translated, in the same way as the  net  carrying  amounts  to  which  they  are  compared,  at the  estimated  exchange  rate  for  the  following  year.  The discount  rate  used  for  these  calculations  is  based  on  the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which amounted to  9.2%  in  2023,  to  8.8%  in  2022  and  7.8%  in  2021  for amounts in euro, adjusted where appropriate by a country risk premium according to the geographic zones concerned. The  discount  rates  are  post-tax  rates  applied  to  post-tax cash  flows,  and  result  in  recoverable  amounts  identical  to those  obtained  by  applying  pre-tax  rates  to  pre-tax  cash flows.  The  assumptions  adopted  in  terms  of  sales  growth and terminal values are reasonable and consistent with the available  market  data  (generally  2.5%  for  Europe  and  3% for  the  rest  of  the  world  for  terminal  values  except  in specific cases).\n\nThe  use  of  discounted  cash  flow  forecasts  is  preferred  in order  to  determine  recoverable  amounts,  unless  details  of similar recent transactions are readily available.\n\nImpairment charged against goodwill cannot be reversed.\n\nImpairment tests of Cash Generating Units for which the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is significant, are carried out based on the following data and assumptions:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net carrying amount of goodwill and brands with an indefinite useful life (1) |         |         |         |\n| Perfumes                                                                      | 1,842.0 | 1,842.2 | 1,812.9 |\n| L'Or\u00e9al Paris                                                                 | 1,227.7 | 1,235.7 | 1,215.6 |\n| Maquillage Mass Market                                                        | 1,086.7 | 1,109.5 | 1,067.5 |\n| SkinCeuticals/Skinbetter Science                                              | 921.5   | 938.2   | 234.7   |\n| Lanc\u00f4me                                                                       | 845.0   | 850.8   | 852.7   |\n| CeraVe                                                                        | 823.2   | 839.0   | 812.5   |\n| Redken/PureOlogy                                                              | 789.6   | 802.4   | 767.2   |\n| Matrix                                                                        | 734.1   | 755.4   | 720.8   |\n| Skincare Luxe                                                                 | 615.7   | 640.4   | 630.7   |\n| YSL Beaut\u00e9                                                                    | 536.2   | 536.4   | 536.0   |\n| IT Cosmetics                                                                  | 493.4   | 757.4   | 726.9   |\n| Stylenanda                                                                    | 478.0   | 493.8   | 494.6   |\n| Garnier                                                                       | 440.7   | 436.6   | 493.8   |\n| NYX Professional Makeup                                                       | 433.3   | 446.4   | 424.6   |\n| L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel/K\u00e9rastase                                               | 422.4   | 429.5   | 417.9   |\n| Vichy                                                                         | 322.4   | 327.3   | 336.2   |\n| Urban Decay                                                                   | 237.1   | 244.1   | 232.4   |\n| Shu Uemura                                                                    | 209.7   | 228.3   | 242.9   |\n\n- (1) Excluding acquisitions during the year.\n\nDue to a delay in the IT Cosmetics Business Plan, mainly due to a delay in the international development of the brand, an impairment  test  was  carried  out  on  the  IT  Cosmetics  Cash Generating  Unit  and  a  loss  of  value  was  recorded  for \u20ac249.9 million.\n\nThe recoverable value of the IT Cosmetics Cash Generating Unit amounts to \u20ac561.3 million at the end of December 2023.\n\nThe  discount  rate  used  at  31  December  2023  for  this  test were between 6.4% and 14.8% including 9.1% for the USA and 9.2% for international.

Financial assets and liabilities - Cost of debt\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Finance costs, net\n\nNet  financial  debt  consists  of  all  current  and  non-current financial borrowings  and  debt,  less  cash  and  cash equivalents.\n\nNet finance costs consist of income and expenses arising on the  items  making  up  net  financial  debt  during  the accounting  period,  including  gains  and  losses  on  the corresponding foreign exchange rate hedges.\n\n## Borrowings and debt\n\nBorrowings and debt are valued at amortised cost based on an effective interest rate.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principle  of  fair  value  hedge accounting,  fixed-rate  borrowings  and  debt  swapped  at  a floating  rate  are  valued  on  the  balance  sheet  at  market value.  The  resulting  changes  in  value  are  recorded  as finance costs and are offset by changes in the value of the related interest rate swaps.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  is  determined  by  the discounted cash flow method using bond yield curves at the closing  date,  allowing  for  the  spread  corresponding  to  the Group's risk class to be taken into account.\n\nThe carrying amount of floating-rate debt is a reasonable approximation of its fair value.\n\nMedium- and long-term borrowings and debt are recorded under  Non-current  liabilities.  Short-term  borrowings  and debt  as  well  as  the  current  portion  of  medium-  and  longterm  borrowings  and  debt  are  presented  under  Current liabilities.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalent\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in bank accounts, units  of  cash  unit  trusts  and  liquid  short-term  investments with  a  negligible  risk  of  changes  in  value  and  a  maturity date of less than three months at the date of acquisition.\n\nInvestments  in  shares  and  cash,  which  are  held  in  an account  blocked  for  more  than  three  months,  cannot  be recorded  under  cash  and  are  presented  under  Other current assets.\n\nBank overdrafts considered to be financing are presented in Current borrowings and debt.\n\nThe  money-market  unit  trusts  are  classified  as  financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. As such, they are valued  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value  at  the closing date. Any related unrealised gains are accounted for in Finance costs, Net in the income statement.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  bank  deposits  is  a  reasonable approximation of their fair value.\n\n## Non-current financial assets\n\nNon-current  financial  assets  include  investments  in  nonconsolidated companies and long-term loans and receivables maturing after more than 12 months.\n\nInvestments  in  non-consolidated  companies  are  classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income.  As  such,  they  are  valued  on  the basis of their fair value, and unrealised losses and gains are accounted for through equity on the line Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair value of listed securities is determined on the basis of the share price at the closing date. For unlisted securities, in  the  absence  of  specific  events,  their  acquisition  cost  is deemed to be the best possible estimate of fair value.\n\nLong-term  loans  and  receivables  are  considered  to  be assets generated by the business. As such, they are valued at amortised cost. If there is an indication of a loss in value, a provision for impairment is recorded.\n\n## 9.1. Borrowings and debt\n\nThe  Group  conducts  bond  issues  to  cover  its  medium-term  financing  needs  and  issues  short-term  marketable  instruments  in France and commercial paper in the US to cover its financing needs in the short term. None of the Group's borrowings or debt contains an early repayment clause linked to financial ratios (covenants).\n\n## 9.1.1.

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 10. Derivatives and exposure to market risks\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  to  hedge  identifiable foreign exchange and interest rate risks are accounted for in accordance with hedge accounting principles.\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and options are put in place in order to hedge items recorded in the balance sheet (fair value hedges) and cash flows on highly probable future commercial transactions (cash flow hedges).\n\nAll  foreign  exchange hedging instruments are recorded on the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  including  those which relate to purchases and sales in the next accounting period.  Hence  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  hedging instruments  is  recorded  in  shareholders'  equity  and  the amount  accumulated  in  shareholders'  equity  impacts  the result on the date of completion of hedged transactions.\n\nAny remaining hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nIn accordance with hedge accounting, unrealised exchange gains and losses relating to unsold inventories are deferred in  the  inventories  item  in  the  balance  sheet.  Similarly,  if  a currency  hedge  has  been  taken  out  in  respect  of  fixed assets  purchased  with  foreign  currency,  these  assets  are valued in the balance sheet on the basis of the hedging rate.\n\nThe  Group  may  decide  to  hedge  certain  investments  in foreign  companies.  Exchange  gains  or  losses  relating  to these  hedges  are  directly  charged  to  consolidated  equity, under the item Cumulative translation adjustments.\n\nWith  regard  to  interest  rate  risk,  fixed-rate  debt  and financial loans hedged by interest rate swaps are valued in the balance sheet at their market value. Changes in the fair value  of  these  items  are  recorded  as  finance  costs  and offset  by  adjustments  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related hedging derivatives. Floating-rate debt and financial loans are valued at cost, which corresponds to their market value. The swaps or caps which hedge these items are valued in the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  with  changes  in value  recorded  directly  through  equity  on  the  Other comprehensive income item.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate derivative instruments is their market  value.  This  market  value  is  calculated  by  the discounted cash flow method at the interest rate effective at the closing date.\n\nTo  manage  its  exposure  to  currency  and  interest  rate  risks  arising  in  the  course  of  its  normal  operations,  the  Group  uses derivatives negotiated with counterparties rated investment grade.\n\nIn accordance with Group rules, currency and interest rate derivatives are set up exclusively for hedging purposes.\n\n## 10.1. Hedging of currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  commercial transactions  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  and  on  highly probable future transactions.\n\nThe Group's policy regarding its exposure to currency risk on future commercial transactions is to hedge, before the end of the  year,  a  large  part  of  the  currency  risk  for  the  following year,  using  derivatives  based  on  operating  budgets  in  each subsidiary.\n\nAll  the  Group's future foreign currency flows are analysed in detailed  forecasts  for  the  coming  budgetary  year.  Any currency risks identified are hedged by forward contracts or options  in  order  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  currency exposure  of  each  subsidiary.  The  term  of  the  derivatives  is aligned with the Group's settlements. Exchange  rate derivatives are negotiated by FINVAL or, in exceptional cases, directly  by  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  Such  transactions  are supervised by the Group's Treasury department.\n\nAs  a  non-financial  corporation,  FINVAL  is  subject  to  the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR). Published  by  the  European  Commission  in  September  2012, EMIR is aimed at moving OTC markets towards a centralised model, thereby enhancing market transparency and regulatory  oversight  and  decreasing  systemic  risk  using  a guarantee  mechanism.  As  the  Group's  companies  must borrow  and  invest  their  cash  in  their  own  currency,  the exchange  rate  risks  generated  by  managing  their  own  cash and debt are almost non-existent.\n\nOwing to the Group's policy of currency risk hedging a large part of annual requirements for the following year before the end  of  the  current  year,  the  sensitivity  of  profit  or  loss  to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  at  31  December  is marginal. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the foreign exchange cash flow hedges reserve is described in note 11.3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Foreign exchange gains and losses\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the difference between the value of foreign currency operating income and expenses translated at the spot rate effective on the transaction date and at the exchange rate effective on the settlement date are recognised directly on the appropriate income and expense lines, after allowing for hedging derivatives.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses break down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                              |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Time value                              | -121.7 | -105.1 |  -70.5 |\n| Other foreign exchange gains and losses |   41.1 | -309.6 |   17.7 |\n| TOTAL                                   |  -80.6 | -414.7 |  -52.8 |\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate at the transaction date.\n\nAssets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies have been  translated  using  the  exchange  rates  effective  at  the closing date. Foreign exchange gains and losses also include the following items relating to derivative instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in market value linked to variations in the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the date when the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 residual  ineffectiveness  linked  to  excess  hedges  and recognised  directly  in  the  income  statement  under  other foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  for  \u20ac1.6  million, \u20ac24.5  million  and  \u20ac1.5  million  in  2023,  2022  and  2021, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

They are broken down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of sales                                |  -49.2 | -324.2 |  -37.2 |\n| Research and innovation expenses             |  -12   |   29.6 |   -4.2 |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           |   -8.7 |  -61.5 |   -5.9 |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses |  -10.7 |  -58.7 |   -5.5 |\n| FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES            |  -80.6 | -414.7 |  -52.8 |\n\n## 10.3. Hedging of interest rate risk\n\nThe Group did not have any interest rate hedging instruments at 31 December 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## 10.4. Sensitivity to changes in interest rates\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have had a direct positive impact of \u20ac34.7 million on the Group's net  finance  costs  at  31  December  2023,  compared  with  a direct  positive  impact  of  \u20ac9.8  million  at  31  December  2022 and a direct negative impact of -\u20ac18.2 million at 31 December 2021.  This  calculation  allows  for  cash,  cash  equivalents  and derivatives,  and  assumes  that  total  net  debt/cash  remains stable  and  that  fixed-rate  debt  at  maturity  is  replaced  by floating-rate debt.\n\nThe impact of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates on the fair  value  of  the  Group's  fixed-rate  financial  assets  and liabilities,  after  allowing  for  any  interest  rate  derivatives,  can be  estimated  at  -\u20ac60.2  million  at  31  December  2023 compared  with  -\u20ac23.9  million  at  31  December  2022  and  \u20ac1.0 million 31 December 2021.\n\n## 10.5. Counterparty risk\n\nThe  Group  has  financial  relations  with  international  banks rated  investment  grade  by  specialised  agencies.  The  Group thus considers that its exposure to counterparty risk is low.\n\nFurthermore,  the  financial  instruments  used  to  manage exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  risk  are  issued  by  leading international banking counterparties.\n\nAccordingly, the Group considers its exposure to counterparty risk to be low.\n\n## 10.6. Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk can be assessed on the basis of its outstanding short-term debt under its short-term marketable instruments  programme.  Should  these  bank  facilities  not  be renewed,  the  Group  would  have  confirmed  undrawn  credit lines of \u20ac5,000 million at 31 December 2023. These lines were not subject to any covenants.\n\n## 10.7. Shareholding risk\n\nNo cash has been invested in shares.\n\nAvailable cash is invested with top-ranking financial institutions in the form of non-speculative instruments which can  be  drawn  in  very  short  periods.  At  31  December  2023, marketable  securities  consist  exclusively of unit trusts (note 9.2.).\n\nAt  31  December  2023,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,612.1 million (note 9.3.).\n\nThe initial share price for Sanofi shares was \u20ac34.12.\n\nThe  shares  are  valued  based  on  their  fair  value,  and unrealised losses and gains are accounted for through equity in the Other comprehensive income item.\n\nAt  31  December  2022,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,621.5 million (note 9.3.).\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,472.6 million (note 9.3.).\n\n## 10.8. Fair value hierarchy\n\nIFRS  7  requires  financial  assets  and  liabilities  recognised  at fair  value  in  the  balance  sheet  to  be  classified  according  to three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 level 1: quoted prices on an active market;\n- \u00b7 level 2: valuation techniques using observable inputs;\n- \u00b7 level 3: valuation techniques using unobservable inputs.",

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities resulting from foreign exchange and/or  interest  rate  hedging  transactions  entered  into  with the Group's counterparty banks are not offset in the balance sheet since they are FBF (French Banking Federation) or ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements  that  only  provide  for  offsetting  in  the  event  of default by one of the parties to the agreement. Accordingly, they do not meet the offsetting criteria set out in IAS 32.\n\nHad  the  agreements  been  offset  at  the  level  of  each counterparty bank, assets and liabilities would have decreased by \u20ac105.5 million, \u20ac156.7 million and \u20ac62.7 million respectively in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Provisions for liabilities and charges - Contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes\n\n## 12.1. Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  set  up  to  cover probable  outflows  for  the  benefit  of  third  parties  without any equivalent consideration being received by the Group in return. They mainly relate to restructuring costs, industrial,environmental  and  commercial  risks  relating  to operations such as breach of contract, product returns, and employee-related risks.\n\nThese  provisions  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  most likely assumptions or by using statistical methods, depending on the nature of the risks.\n\nProvisions for liabilities and charges are recorded either as Non-current liabilities or as Current liabilities , depending on their type. Provisions for liabilities or disputes which must be settled  within  12  months  of  the  closing  date,  and  those linked  to  the  normal  operating  cycle  (such  as  product returns), are recorded as Current liabilities . Other provisions for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recorded  as Non-current liabilities.\n\n## 12.1.1.

Contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is party to several material disputes, described below:\n\n## 12.2.1. Tax disputes\n\n## Brazil - IPI indirect tax base challenged\n\nIn  January 2015, decree 8.393/2015 stated that commercial companies in Brazil would be liable for the indirect IPI tax on certain  products  as  from  1  May  2015.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  challenging the legal grounds of this decree and its application. In light of changes in market practices and a favourable change in the opinion  of  its  advisers,  since  1  January  2018  L'Or\u00e9al  has recognised the IPI collected under income.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding  the indirect  IPI  tax  for  financial  years  2008  and  2011  to  2015 totalling  \u20ac711  million,  including  interest  and  penalties.  The Brazilian  tax  authorities  are  questioning  the  ex-works  sales price to the commercial arm used to calculate the IPI tax base. After  consulting  with  its  tax  advisors,  L'Or\u00e9al  considers  that the  Brazilian  tax  authorities'  position  is  unfounded  and  has challenged these notices. L'Or\u00e9al continues its legal proceedings with the tax and legal authorities.\n\nIn  light  of  the  negative  developments in administrative court decisions  on  the  same  matter  for  other  Brazilian  groups, L'Or\u00e9al  funded  a  provision  for  \u20ac47  million  to  partially  cover this risk.\n\n## India - Advertising, marketing and promotional costs challenged\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  several  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding financial years 2007/08 to 2017/18 and 2019/20 for the most part concerning the tax deductibility of advertising, marketing and promotional expenses for a total amount of \u20ac213 million including  interest  and  penalties.  After  consulting  with  its  tax advisors,  L'Or\u00e9al  decided  to  contest  these  notices  and continues  the  legal  proceedings  with  the  administrative  and legal authorities.\n\n## Mutual agreement procedures\n\nMutual  agreement  procedures  were  instigated  vis-\u00e0-vis  the French,  Indonesian  and  Singaporean  tax  authorities  in  order to eliminate double taxation following disagreements between these authorities.\n\nThe  Italian  procedure  has  just  been  resolved,  the  tax administrations having agreed to eliminate double taxation.\n\n## 12.2.2. Investigations carried out by the competition authorities\n\nThe  national  competition  authorities  in  several  European countries have launched investigations targeting the cosmetics industry in particular.\n\n## a) Europe (excluding France)\n\nIn Greece, in its decision passed down on 4 October 2017, the Greek competition authority condemned L'Or\u00e9al Hellas to pay a  fine  of  \u20ac2.6  million  for  carrying  out  anti-competitive practices in 2005-2006. L'Or\u00e9al Hellas refuted all allegations of  having  engaged  in  anti-competitive  practices  with  other luxury  cosmetics  manufacturers.  The  Greek  Administrative Court of Appeal quashed this decision on 5 November 2018. The  Greek  competition  authority  lodged  an  appeal  in cassation  against  this  decision  on  28  January  2019.  This appeal was rejected by the Greek Council of State by a ruling on 2 August 2023. This case is therefore definitively closed.\n\nIn  Germany,  after  the  German  competition  authority  filed  a lawsuit in 2008 in the area of personal care products, which was  definitively  closed  in  2015,  distributors  filed  a  lawsuit seeking damages against L'Or\u00e9al Germany which has resulted in  dismissals  by  the  courts  at  this  stage.  These  proceedings are still ongoing. L'Or\u00e9al Germany is contesting the merits of these claims and denies that any damages occurred.\n\n## b) France\n\nIn  France,  on  18  December  2014,  the  French  competition authority  handed  down  a  fine  of  \u20ac189.5  million  against L'Or\u00e9al  in  the  hygiene  products  sector  for  events  that  took place in the early 2000s. On 27 October 2016, the Paris Court of  Appeal  upheld  this  first  instance  decision.  L'Or\u00e9al  refutes all  accusations  of  concerted  practices  with  its  competitors and  regrets  that  the  French  competition  authority  did  not take  into  account  the  highly  competitive  French  market  in household and hygiene products as illustrated by the number of  manufacturers  and  retailers  present  on  the  market,  the large choice of products available to consumers, and the high degree of innovation and number of product launches.\n\nFollowing an appeal lodged by L'Or\u00e9al, on 27 March 2019, the Court of Cassation partially overturned the ruling relating to the amount of the fine imposed on L'Or\u00e9al. On 18 June 2020, the  Second  Court  of  Appeal  confirmed  the  initial  amount  of the  fine.  L'Or\u00e9al  lodged  a  second  appeal  with  the  Court  of Cassation against this ruling that was rejected on 18 October 2023.\n\nThis  final  ruling  has  no  impact  on  the  Group's  income statement and no cash flow impact, as the fine was paid in 2015.\n\nFollowing  this  ruling,  the  distributors  filed  lawsuits  for damages  against  L'Or\u00e9al.  These  proceedings  are  in  initial stages  or  resulted  in  dismissals  by  the  courts.  These proceedings  are  still  ongoing.  L'Or\u00e9al  contests  the  merits  of these claims and denies that any damages occurred.\n\nAt the present time, no other exceptional events or disputes are highly likely to have a material impact on the earnings, financial situation, assets, or operations of the Company or the L'Or\u00e9al Group.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13. Sustainable development and the climate\n\n## 13.1. Measurement of assets and liabilities\n\n## a) Environmental risks\n\nThe Group strictly complies with regulations and laws relating to  environmental  protection,  and  does  not  expect  current regulations  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  the  Group's operations, financial position, earnings or assets.\n\n## b) Measurement of assets\n\nFor many years, L'Or\u00e9al has shown a strong commitment to environmental,  social  and  societal  responsibility.  L'Or\u00e9al placed  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  its  strategy,  with  the launch in 2013 of the Sharing Beauty With All programme with 2020 targets focused on sustainable production, sustainable innovation, sustainable consumption and shared growth.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  phase  of  its commitments  to  sustainability,  under  the  umbrella  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  with  a  new  set  of particularly ambitious and concrete targets for 2030, in order to  cover  all  the  impacts  associated  with  its  value  chain:  its production  and  distribution  sites  as  well  as  its  supply  chains and  the  impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  products  by consumers.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group undertakes to reach 100% renewable energy for its  sites (1) for  all  Group  sites  by  2025,  by  improving energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  100%  of  ingredients  in  formulas  and  biobased packaging  materials  will  be  traceable  and  come  from sustainable  sources.  None  of  them  will  contribute  to deforestation;\n\n## 13.2. Financing, investments and compensation\n\nThe  Group's L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  rests  on  its financing, short- and long-term investment and compensation strategies.\n\n## a) Financing\n\nThe  credit  lines indexed  to  the  Group's  sustainability performance  incorporate  a  borrowing  cost  adjustment mechanism.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  has  a  syndicated  loan  from  20  banks (\u20ac5 billion), which had not been used at the end of  December  2023.  This  loan  incorporates  a  mechanism whereby  the  margin  is  adjusted  in  line  with  the  Group's performance  with  regard  to  four  ESG  KPIs:  climate, biodiversity, resources and social commitment.\n\nThe Group issued in 2022 a \u20ac3 billion bond, one tranche of which  in  an  amount  of  \u20ac1,250  million  is  sustainability-linked (note 9.1).\n\n## b) Short-term investment\n\nThe  Group's  available  cash  is  mainly  invested  in  SRI  SICAV money-market  funds  (60%  of  all  short-term  investment  in 2023) and term accounts (40% of all short-term investment in 2023 of which 70% in CSR STI).\n\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  100%  of  the  plastics  used  in  packaging  will  be from either recycled or biobased sources;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  undertakes  to  innovate  to  enable  its consumers to reduce by 25%, on average and per finished product,  the  water  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions  linked  to  the  use  of  its  products,  compared  to 2016.\n\nThe  above  commitments  do  not  jeopardise  the  value  of  the Group's assets or the useful lives of our non-financial assets. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 our  ongoing  efforts  to  bring  our  products  in  line  with consumer  demand  as  part  of L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future are included in  the  Group's  short-term  strategic  plans  used  in impairment  tests  on  intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite useful  life  and  have  no  impact  on  the  book  value  of  the assets;\n- \u00b7 to date, the adaptation of our plants and product formulas has  not  led  us  to  identify  any  risk  of  our  production  lines becoming  obsolete  and  does  not  call  into  question  the depreciation period of assets.\n\nFurthermore,  based  on  data  from  the  climate  study  on environmental  risks,  the  impact  of  climate  change  on consumer  behaviour  was  taken  into  account  in  the  business plans used for impairment tests of intangible assets and is, to date,  considered  as  having  no  significant  impact  on  the carrying value of the assets.\n\n## c) Long-term investment\n\nThe  Group  recorded  a  total  of  \u20ac191  million  in  non-current financial  assets  related  to  sustainability  activities,  measured at fair value through equity (note 9.3).\n\n- \u00b7 At the end of 2021, investment in Circular Innovation Fund amounting  to  \u20ac50  million.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  one  of  the  main contributors to this fund, that aims at financing innovative companies  in the field of recycling, plastic waste management or even materials from the bioeconomy.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, the creation of a fund for Nature Regeneration to financially support projects to restore natural marine, forest and agricultural ecosystems (\u20ac75 million of which \u20ac50 million intended to support the fund's actions).\n- \u00b7 Investment in start-ups (\u20ac66 million in total):\n- \u00b7 including the Swiss environmental technology firm Gjosa, which  developed  innovative  water  saving  solutions,  the French  biotech  company  Global  Bioenergies,  which developed  a  process  to  convert  plant-based  resources, the Green Chemistry start-up Carbios, which developed enzymatic  processes  for  plastic  biodegradation  and biorecycling  and  the  French  biotech  Microphyt  which developped  a  process  with  a  low  carbon  impact  to produce microalgae;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since  2016,  non-\n\ninancial  objectives  in  line  with  the  Group's  goals  for sustainability have been included in the variable remuneration of the top  management,  including  international  brand managers and country managers.\n\nFor  the  conditional  grant  of  free  shares,  plans  since  2022 stipulate the fulfilment of non-financial performance criteria, of which:\n\n- \u00b7 the  fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme;\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  strategic  positions  including  the Executive Committee.\n\nAt  31  December  2023,  these  performance  conditions  of  an extra-financial nature were deemed achieved.\n\n## Note 14.

Statutory Auditors' Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2023\n\nThis is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company issued in  French  and  it  is  provided  solely  for  the  convenience  of  English-speaking  users.This  statutory  auditors'  report  includes information  required  by  European  regulations  and  French  law,  such  as  information  about  the  appointment  of  the  statutory auditors or the verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to the shareholders.This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  annual  general  meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited nonaudit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

The  assumptions  taken  into  account  in  the valuation of the recoverable value are described in Note 7.3 and mainly relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 the increase in revenue and the margin rate;\n- \u00b7 an infinite growth rate for calculating the terminal value, and\n- \u00b7 discount rates based on the weighted average cost of capital, including a country risk premium if necessary.\n\nThe  impairment  tests  carried  out  in  2023  showed  an impairment  of  M\u20ac  250  on  goodwill  and  an  impairment  of M\u20ac 20 on brands.\n\nWe considered the valuation of these assets to be a key audit matter  given  their  relative  proportion  in  the  consolidated financial statements, and because determining their recoverable value requires significant judgment from Management in order to determine future cash flow projections and the key assumptions used.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of Management's methodology for conducting impairment tests and sensitivity analyses.\n\nWe evaluated these, especially by reconciling them with our own sensitivity analyses, in order to define the nature and scope of our work.\n\nWe  assessed  the  quality  of  the  budgeting  and  forecasting processes.\n\nFor  the  impairment  tests  of  the  assets  considered  the  most sensitive,  our  work  consisted  in  particular  in  assessing  the reasonableness of the main estimates, and more specifically in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  consistency  of  revenue  and  margin  rate projections  with  your  Group's  past  performance  and  the economic and financial context in which your Group operates;\n- \u00b7 corroborating the future growth rates used with the performance  analyses  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking into  account  the  specificities  of  the  local  markets  and  the distribution channels in which your Group operates;\n- \u00b7 analyzing  the  discount  rates  applied  to  future  cash  flows  by comparing the parameters used with external references, longterm  growth  rates  and  royalty  rates  by  including  valuation experts in our team;\n- \u00b7 examining  sensitivity  analyses  against  Management's  key assumptions and against our own analyses.\n\nWe assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information  given  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Revenue recognition: estimation of items deducted from revenue\n\nSee  Note  3  'Operating  items  -  Sector-specific  information  -  Accounting  principles  -  Revenue',  to  the  consolidated  financial statements\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nYour Group's revenue is presented net of product returns and discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to distributors or consumers  (such  as  commercial  cooperation),  as  described  in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese various deductions from revenue are recorded simultaneously with the recognition of sales in particular on the basis  of  contractual  conditions  and  statistical  data  from  past experience.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  the  valuation  of  the  revenue thus includes estimates related to the amounts deducted, which we  considered  to  be  (i)  complex,  due  to  the  diversity  of contractual  agreements  and  commercial  conditions  existing  in your Group's various markets, (ii) sensitive, the revenue being a key  indicator  in  the  valuation  of  your  Group's  and  its Management's  performance,  and  (iii)  significant,  given  their impact in the financial statements.\n\nThe valuation of product returns, discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to customers therefore constitutes a key audit matter.\n\nWe assessed the  appropriateness  of  your  Group's  accounting principles  relating  to  the  recognition  of  product  returns, discounts, rebates and other benefits granted to customers, in accordance with IFRS.\n\nWe obtained  an  understanding  of  the  internal  control  system put  in  place  in  your  Group's  commercial  entities,  which  allows the  valuation  and  recognition  of  the  items  deducted  from  the revenue, especially at closing, and we tested, by sampling, the main controls of this system.\n\nWe  also  carried  out  substantial  tests  in  order  to  assess  the reasonableness  of  the  product  returns  and  customer  benefits estimates. These tests specifically consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 analyzing the valuation methods used, in particular by critically examining the assumptions used, checking the permanence of the methods and analyzing the anteriority and unwinding of the previous financial year's provisions;\n- \u00b7 reconciling  the  statistical  data  from  past  experience  and contractual conditions with the data contained in the information systems used to manage commercial conditions;\n- \u00b7 verifying  the  arithmetic  accuracy  of  the  calculation  of  the corresponding  entries  (including  the  residual  commitment  at closing), their recording in the accounts and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

Regarding consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging thereof complies with the format defined in the above-mentioned regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single  electronic  format,  the  content  of  certain  tags  of  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  to  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurthermore, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your Company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers) agree with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of L'Or\u00e9al by your annual general meeting held on April 29, 2004 for DELOITTE & ASSOCIES and on April 21, 2022 for ERNST & YOUNG Audit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, DELOITTE & ASSOCIES was in the twentieth year of total uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG Audit in the second year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for  such  internal  control  as  Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  made  on  the  basis  of  these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  821-55  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report  significant  deficiencies,  if  any,  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de  la  profession  de  commissaire  aux  comptes) .

The acquisition by the subsidiary  L'Or\u00e9al  Australia,  wholly-owned  by  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A., was finalised in August 2023. It was financed in the amount of \u20ac0.4 billion by cash held by the Group and a bond issued in May  2023  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac2  billion  in  two  tranches  (see note 18).\n\nReorganisations of a legal nature were carried out following this  acquisition.  In  November  2023,  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  acquired 100% of  A\u00e9sop  UK  shares  from  Em\u00e9is  Holding  PTY  Ltd  for \u20ac968.2 million.\n\nIn September 2023, L'Or\u00e9al sold the Sanoflore brand to Ekkio Capital, a French investment fund specialising in SMEs in the healthcare and beauty sector. The impact of this disposal on L'Or\u00e9al S.A.'s income statement was not significant.\n\n## Other events\n\nIn  November  2023,  the  Group  issued  a  further  bond  for \u20ac1.5 billion in two tranches (see note 18).",

        "page_content": "## Note 1. Accounting principles\n\nThe  Company's  annual  financial  statements  are  prepared in  accordance  with  French  law  and  regulations,  as  set  out in  Regulation ANC 2014-03 (French Chart of Accounts) and generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The  accounts  for the  2023  financial  year  were  prepared  and  approved  on  a going concern basis.\n\n## 1.1. Sales\n\nThese are comprised of sales of goods (net of returns, rebates and discounts) and services (including technological assistance fees).\n\n## 1.2. Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nExpenses  relating  to  the  advertisement  and  promotion of  products  to  customers  and  consumers  are  recognised as expenses for the financial year in which the advertisement or promotional initiative takes place.\n\n## 1.3. Research and innovation costs\n\nResearch  and  innovation  costs  are  recognised  in  expenses in he period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 1.4. Loan issue costs\n\nIssuance  costs  of  borrowings  are  expensed  immediately  in the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\n## 1.5. Income tax\n\nThe  Company  has  opted  for  the  French  tax  group  regime. French subsidiaries included in the scope of tax consolidation recognise an income tax charge in their own accounts on the basis of their own taxable profits and losses.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, as the parent company of the tax group, recognises as  tax  income  the  difference  between  the  aggregate  tax charges recognised by the subsidiaries and the tax due on the basis of consolidated taxable profit or loss of the tax group.\n\n## 1.6. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at purchase cost, including acquisition costs.\n\nTechnical  merger  losses  are  allocated  to  the  corresponding underlying assets and amortised where appropriate.\n\nThe value of newly acquired trademarks is calculated based on  a  multi-criteria  approach  taking  into  consideration  their reputation and their future contribution to profits.\n\nIn accordance with regulation No. 2004-06 on assets, certain trademarks  have  been  identified  as  amortisable  regarding their estimated useful life.\n\nNon-amortisable  trademarks  are  tested  for  impairment  at least once a year on the basis of the valuation model used at the time of their acquisition. An impairment is recorded where appropriate. Initial trademark registration costs are recorded as expenses.\n\nPatents  are  amortised  over  a  period  ranging  from  two  to 10 years.\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements of L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nBusiness goodwill is not amortised. It is impaired whenever the present  value  of  future cash  flows  is  less  than  the  carrying amount. Impairment tests are conducted at least once a year, even when there is no evidence of impairment loss.\n\nSoftware of material value is amortised using the straight-line method  over  its  probable  useful  life,  generally  between five and eight years. It is also subject to accelerated tax-driven amortisation, which is recognised over a 12-month period.\n\nOther intangible assets are usually amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years.\n\n## 1.7. Tangible assets\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recognised  at  purchase cost, including acquisition expenses.\n\nThe  useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  as follows:\n\n|                                     | Length      |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Buildings                           | 20-50 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 5-10 years  |\n| Industrial machinery and equipment  | 10 years    |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3-10 years  |\n\nBoth  straight-line  and  declining-balance  depreciation  is calculated over the actual useful lives of the assets concerned. Exceptionally, industrial machinery and equipment is depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  of 10 years, with  all additional  depreciation  classified  as accelerated tax-driven depreciation. Exceptional depreciation may  be  recognised  where  events  and  circumstances  lead to a review of the asset's useful life.\n\n## 1.8. Financial assets\n\n## 1.8.1. Equity investments\n\nThese items are recognised in the balance sheet at purchase cost, excluding incidental expenses.\n\nTheir  value  is  assessed  annually  by  reference  to  their  value in  use,  which  is  mainly  based  on  the  current  and  forecast profitability  of  the  subsidiary  concerned  and  the  share  of shareholders' equity owned. If the value in use falls below the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.\n\n## 1.8.2. Other financial assets\n\nLoans  and  other  receivables  are  valued  at  their  nominal amount  and  those  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the financial  year.  If  necessary,  impairments  are  also  recognised against  them  to  reflect  their  value  in  use  at  the  end  of  the financial year.\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  in  connection  with  buyback programmes with a view to being cancelled are recognised in other long-term investments.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, other long-term investments are  compared with their probable sale price and a provision for impairment recognised where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  the  end  of  each  accounting  period,  obsolete and slow-moving inventories are written down if, on the basis of  historical  and  forecast  data,  their  probable  net  realisable value is less than their gross value.\n\n## 1.10. Trade accounts receivable and other receivables\n\nTrade accounts receivable and other receivables are recorded at  their  nominal  value.  Where  appropriate,  an  impairment  is recognised  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  risk  of  nonrecovery.\n\n## 1.11. Marketable securities cash and cash equivalents\n\nMarketable  securities  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost  and are valued at the end of the financial year at their probable sale price.\n\nTreasury shares held that is specifically allocated to employee stock option and free shares plans recognised in marketable securities.\n\nNo  discount  is  granted  on  the  exercise  price  of  the  options. Provided that the shares are purchased at a lower price than the  exercise  price,  no  impairment  is  required.  However, an  impairment  is  recognised  in  the  event  of  a  decline  in  the market  price,  representing  the  difference  between  the  net carrying  amount  of  the  treasury  shares  and  the  average share price in the month preceding the reporting date.\n\nA provision for liabilities  and  charges in respect of shares of Treasury shares allocated to free share plans for L'Or\u00e9al S.A. parent  company  employees  is  recognised  over  the  period during  which  the  rights  to  the  free  shares  vest.  Shares  of Treasury shares allocated to free share plans for employees of  Group  subsidiaries  are  written  down  in  full.  However, the  subsidiaries  concerned  will  bear  most  of  the  cost  of granting these free shares.\n\n## 1.12. Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recognised  to  cover probable  outflows  of  resources  to  third  parties,  without receipt  of  equivalent  consideration  by  the  Company.  They mainly concern risks and disputes of a commercial, financial, tax or social nature.\n\nThe estimated amount included in provisions corresponds to the  outflow  of  resources  that  the  Company  is  likely  to  incur in  the  settlement  of  its  obligation.  Depending  on  the  type  of provision,  the  estimate  takes  account  of  the  most  probable assumptions of realisation, or is assessed in line with statistical methods.\n\nContingent  liabilities  are  potential  obligations  arising  from past  events,  whose  existence  will  only  be  confirmed  by  the occurrence  of  future  (uncertain)  events  that  are  not  wholly within  the  control  of  the  Company  or  probable  liabilities  for which  the  outflow  of  resources  is  also  not  within  its  control. Contingent  liabilities  are  not  recognised  and  are  disclosed where applicable.\n\n## 1.13. Accounting for foreign currency transactions and exchange rate hedges\n\nAll  receivables, payables, loans and borrowings denominated in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  on  the  balance  sheet  at the exchange rate prevailing as of the reporting date for the financial  year.  These  exchange  rate  variations,  as  well  as those linked to the hedging instruments taken out to cover the said receivables, payables, loans and borrowings denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  are  recorded  in  the balance  sheet  under  the  heading  'Unrealised  exchange losses/gains'.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  if  the  sum  of  these  translation adjustments  shows  a  potential  exchange  loss  based  on  the overall  exchange  position,  calculated  on  a  currency-bycurrency basis. The overall foreign exchange position excludes translation  differences  of  hedging  instruments  and  hedged items\n\nIn accordance  with  French  accounting  standards,  the potential  gain  resulting  from  the  overall  foreign  exchange position is not recognised as income in the income statement.\n\nExchange rate hedging instruments are contracted to hedge commercial  transactions  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet and  future  transactions  that  are  considered  to  be  highly probable.  Gains  and  losses  generated  by  these  instruments are recognised symmetrically with the gains and losses arising on the hedged items, in the same aggregate as profit and loss. Option  premium  income/discounts  are  recognised  in  profit and loss when the hedged item is recognised in profit and loss.\n\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified as isolated open positions. These are recognised at their fair value  in  the  balance  sheet,  and  offset  a  'Translation adjustments' account.\n\nHedges have already been taken out in respect of forecasted operating transactions for the next financial year. The impact of  such  hedges  on  profit  or  loss  will  be  recorded  during  the same financial year as the transactions hedged.\n\n## 1.14. Accounting for interest rate instruments\n\nIn  the  case  of  interest-rate  hedges,  for  gains  and  losses arising  on  interest  rate swaps  and caps,  hedging  financial liabilities are recorded on a pro rata basis symmetrically with the gains and losses on the items hedged.\n\n## 1.15. Employee retirement obligations and related benefits\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al parent company  operates  pension,  early retirement  and  other  benefit  schemes  for  employees  and retirees depending  on  local  legislation  and  regulations. Directors  and  corporate  officers  are  regarded  as  employees for  all  additional  benefits  relating  to  their  remuneration,  and are therefore covered by the same employee benefit schemes.\n\nThese obligations are partially funded by an external scheme where the funds are gradually built up through contributions paid.  The  contributions  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  the Other purchases and external charges item.",

        "page_content": "The related obligations are measured using an actuarial valuation method  based  on  final  salaries.  The  method  takes  account  of length  of  service,  life  expectancy,  turnover  by  category  of personnel  and  economic  assumptions  such  as  inflation  and discount  rates.  The  Company  has  opted  for  the  new  method provided  by  recommendation  ANC  2013-02  on  the  accounting treatment of pension obligations and similar benefits as amended on 5 November 2021. That is to say, the increase in the obligation for each employee is no longer recognised on a straight-line basis over his or her term of employment but straight-line only over the vesting period for his or her benefit rights.\n\nNotes to the Financial Statements of L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nNo  provision  is  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  for  net unfunded obligations. These thus appear as off-balance sheet commitments.\n\nOnly  obligations  in  respect  of  long-service  awards  are  no longer  recognised  as  an  off-balance  sheet  commitment; instead, a provision is recognised in the balance sheet based on an actuarial valuation of the obligation.\n\n## Note 2.

No performance condition applies below a block of 200 shares.\n\nThe performance conditions for the 12 October 2023 and 13 October 2022 plans are:\n\n- \u00b7 for  80%,  based  on  financial  performance  criteria  that include:\n- \u00b7 for  one  half,  the  growth  in  comparable  cosmetics  net sales - in relation to those of a panel of competitors - for the financial years:\n- - 2024, 2025 and 2026 for the 2023 plan,\n- - 2023, 2024 and 2025 for the 2022 plan,\n\n## 16.3. Capital increase reserved for employees\n\nIn  June  2022,  Group  employees  had  the  opportunity  to  join a Shareholding Plan based on a traditional format with discount and matching contribution.\n\nThe subscription price was set at \u20ac254.9, representing 80% of the average share price over the 20 trading sessions prior to  the  decision  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  setting  the subscription  period  from  8  June  to  22  June  2022  during which 410,943 shares were subscribed. This number does not include the subscription reserved for a Trustee under the laws of  England  and  Wales,  as  part  of  a  Share  Incentive  Plan established  for  Group  employees  in  the  UK,  in  respect  of which 3,376 subscribed shares were agreed in October 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  other  half,  the  increase  over  the  same  period in the Group's  consolidated  operating  profit.  The calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  arithmetic average of the performances for financial years:\n- - 2024, 2025 and 2026 for the 2023 plan,\n- - 2023, 2024 and 2025 for the 2022 plan;\n- \u00b7 for 20%, based on non-financial performance criteria that include:\n- \u00b7 15%  is  associated  with  the  fulfilment  of  environmental and  social  responsibility  commitments  made  by  the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme;\n- \u00b7 5%  is  associated  with  the  gender  balance  within strategic positions, including the Executive Committee.\n\nNo performance condition applies below a block of 100 shares.\n\nThe  plans  of  20  April  2017,  17  April  2018  and  18  April  2019 were  finally  granted  by  the  allocation  of,  respectively, 742,276 shares on 21 April 2021, 868,225 shares on 19 April 2022  and  776,525  shares  on  19  April  2023.  The  number  of fully vested shares for the 18 April 2019 plan took into account the performance percentage achieved at the end of the plan.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the performance conditions of the plans in progress were deemed achieved.\n\nFor  French  employees,  free  shares  were  offered  upon subscription in proportion to their personal contribution to the plan  with  a  maximum  of  four  shares  offered  for  10  shares subscribed.\n\nFor employees in other countries, shares were offered under a  free  share  plan with  a  continued  employment  condition for  the  employee  and  proportionate  to  how  much  the employee  contributes  to  the  plan,  with  a  maximum  of four shares offered for 10 subscribed shares. The shares will be allocated to employees on 26 July 2027 provided they are still with the Group on that date.\n\nThe  share  capital  increase  took  place  on  26  July  2022  for a total of 448,267 shares and on 12 October 2023 for a total of 4,643 shares, including subscribed shares.\n\n| Grant date   | Vesting date France   | Vesting date outside France   | Number of shares granted   | Number of shares issued/allotted   | Number of shares not finally vested   |\n|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 18.06.2018   | 18.06.2018            | 19.06.2023                    | 498,974                    | 490,740                            | -                                     |\n| 02.10.2020   | 02.10.2020            | 03.10.2025                    | 496,991                    | 456,695                            | 35,554                                |\n| 22.06.2022   | 22.06.2022            | 23.06.2027                    | 494,073                    | 451,643                            | 41,057                                |",

Statutory Auditors' Report on the Financial Statements\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2023\n\nThis is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of Englishspeaking users.-\n\nThis statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulations and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or the verification of the management report and other documents provided to the shareholders.This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in  accordance  with,  French  law  and  professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company  as  at  December  31,  2023  and  of  the  results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with  French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited nonaudit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.-\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit  of  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and  in  forming  our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  were recorded at their date of entry at acquisition cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if their value in use falls below their net book value.\n\nAs described in Notes 1.6 and 1.8 to the financial statements, their value is examined annually by reference to their value in use, which takes into account:\n\n- \u00b7 for  investments:  the  current  and  projected  profitability  of  the concerned holding and the share of equity held;\n- \u00b7 for intangible assets: discounted future cash flows.\n\nEstimating the value in use of these assets requires Management's judgment  in  determining  future  cash  flow  projections  and  key assumptions used.\n\nGiven  the  weight  of  investments  and  intangible  assets  in  the balance  sheet  and  the  uncertainties  inherent  in  certain  items, including the realization of forecasts used in the valuation of the value in use, we considered the valuation of these assets to be a key audit matter with a risk of material misstatements.\n\nWe  examined  the  methodology  employed  by  Management  to estimate  the  value  in  use  of  investments  and  intangible  assets (excluding software and assets in progress).\n\nOur audit work mainly focused on examining, on the basis of the information provided to us, that the estimated values determined by Management were based on an appropriate valuation method, and in assessing the quality of these estimates by considering the data, assumptions and calculations used.\n\nWe  focused  our  work  primarily  on  investments  and  intangible assets with a value in use close to their net book value.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the key estimates, and more specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 the  consistency  of  revenue  projections  and  the  margin  rate, compared  to  past  performance  and  to  the  economic  and financial context;\n- \u00b7 the corroboration of the growth  rates  used  with  the performance  analyses  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking into  account  the  specificities  of  the  local  markets  and  of  the distribution channels in which the Company operates;\n- \u00b7 the  discount  rates  applied  to  future  cash  flows  by  comparing their parameters  with  external  references,  by  including valuation experts into our team.\n\n## Revenue Recognition: estimation of items deducted from revenue\n\nSee Notes '1.1 - Accounting principles - Sales' and '2 - Sales' to the financial statements\n\nThis risk relates to the revenue generated by L'Or\u00e9al France during the first six months of the year, prior to the partial contribution of assets of Affaires March\u00e9 France and International Distribution executed July 1 st , 2023.\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nYour  Company's  revenue  is  presented  net  of  product  returns made to distribution and discounts and rebates granted.\n\nThese various deductions from revenue are recorded simultaneously  with  the  recognition  of  sales  in  particular  on  the basis  of  contractual  conditions  and  statistical  data  from  past experience.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the valuation of the revenue thus includes  estimates  related  to  the  amounts  deducted,  which  we considered  to  be  (i)  complex,  due  to  the  diversity  of  contractual agreements and commercial conditions existing in your Company's different  markets,  (ii)  sensitive,  revenue  being  a  key  indicator  in the valuation of the Company's and its Management's performance, and (iii) significant given their impact in the financial statements.\n\nThe  valuation  of  product  returns,  discounts,  rebates  and  other benefits granted to customers is therefore considered to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe  have  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  your  Company's accounting  policies  with  respect  to  the  recognition  of  product returns, discounts,  rebates  and  other  benefits  granted  to customers, in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the internal control system put in  place,  which  allows  the  valuation  and  recognition  of  the  items deducted from revenue, particularly at closing, and we tested, by sampling, the main controls of this system.\n\nWe  also  carried  out  substantive  tests  in  order  to  assess  the reasonableness of the estimate of product returns and customer benefits. These tests mainly consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 analyzing the valuation methods used, in particular by critically examining the assumptions used, checking the permanence of the methods and analyzing the anteriority and unwiding of the previous financial year's provisions;\n- \u00b7 reconciling statistical data from past experience and contractual  conditions  with  data  contained  in  the  information systems used to manage commercial conditions;\n- \u00b7 verifying  the  arithmetic  accuracy  of  the  calculation  of  the corresponding  entries  (including  the  residual  commitment  at closing), their recording in the accounts and their presentation in the financial statements.",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  821-55  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (Code  de  commerce) ,  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  inadequate,  to  modify  the  opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report  significant  deficiencies,  if  any,  in  internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de  la  profession  de  commissaire  aux  comptes) .  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  Committee  the  risks  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La Defense, February 16, 2024 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nDELOITTE & ASSOCIES\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nC\u00e9line Eydieu-Boutt\u00e9",

        "page_content": "The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations  with  third  parties.  The  Company  is  bound  even by actions of the Chief Executive Officer which are outside the  object  of  the  Company,  unless  the  Company  can prove that the third party was aware that the action was outside the object of the Company, or that the third party could not be unaware of this in view of the circumstances, it  being  stated  however that the mere publication of the Articles of association does not constitute such proof.\n\n## 7.1.4. Annual General Meeting\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  governed  by  all  the  legal provisions  and  regulations  laid  down  in  this  connection.  It  is specified that, in accordance with Article 12 of the Company's Articles  of  Association,  if  the  Board  of  Directors  so  decides when the General Meeting is called, any shareholder may take part  in  the  meeting  by  videoconference  or  by  any  other telecommunication  or  remote  transmission  means  including the Internet, under the conditions stipulated by the applicable\n\nInformation relating to the Company\n\n- 4. On the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer,  whether this  office  is  assumed  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  or  by  another  person,  the  Board  of  Directors may  appoint  one  or  more  natural  persons  in  charge  of assisting  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  with  the  title  of Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n- In agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of  Directors  determines  the  extent  and  duration  of  the powers granted to the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.'\n\nregulations at the time it is used. If this decision is taken, it is communicated in the meeting notice published in the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires (BALO).\n\nSince  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  29  April  2004,  double voting rights have been eliminated. Applying the provisions of French  law  No.  2014-384  of  29  March  2014,  the  Annual General Meeting of 22 April 2015 confirmed that each share entitles the holder to only one vote at General Meetings.\n\n## 7.1.5. Statutory distribution of profits (Article 15 of the Articles of Association)\n\n- ' A. From the distributable profits, the following amounts shall be withheld, in the following order:\n- 1. The amount required to pay the 'primary dividend' to the shareholders  equal  to  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  amounts paid up on the unredeemed securities in accordance with calls  for  funds,  provided  however that (where the profits for a given year do not allow such dividend to be paid) the shareholders  shall  not  be  entitled  to  claim  such  dividend from out of the profits of subsequent years.\n- 2. From  the  available  remainder,  the  Ordinary  General Meeting, upon a proposal by the Board of Directors, shall have the authority to resolve to withhold the amounts that it deems appropriate (and even the entire amount of such available  remainder),  either  to  be  carried  forward  to  the next fiscal year, or to be paid into a 'prudential fund' or into one or more ordinary, extraordinary or special reserve funds.  Such  reserve  fund(s),  which  shall  not  bear  any interest,  may  be  distributed  to  the  shareholders,  or allocated  to  complete  the  5%  primary  dividend  for  the shareholders, in the event of insufficient results during one or more fiscal years, or to acquire and to cancel treasury shares, or to redeem in whole or in part such shares.\n- 3. The remaining balance (if any) shall be divided up among all the shareholders, without any discrimination, and each share shall entitle its holder to receive the same income.\n\nHowever, any shareholder who can prove at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  payment  of  the dividend paid for such financial year, will be entitled to a preferential dividend  on  the  shares  that  are  thus registered,  equal  to  10%  of  the  dividend  (initial  dividend and  additional  dividend)  paid  on  the  other  shares, including in the event of payment of the dividend in new shares, the preferential dividend thus paid being rounded down to the nearest lower cent, if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, any shareholder who can prove, at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  completion  of  an increase  in  capital  carried  out  through  capitalisation  of reserves, profits or share premiums by the distribution of free shares, shall be entitled to an increase in the number of free shares to be distributed to him, equal to 10%, this number being rounded down to the nearest lower unit in the event of fractional share rights.\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be identical, for the purposes of calculating the rights to the preferential dividend and to the increased share allocations, to the old shares from which they result.\n\n- The  number  of  shares  eligible  for  these  preferential dividends may not exceed 0.5% of the share capital at the closing  date  of  the  past  financial  year,  for  the  same shareholder.\n- B. The losses (if any) shall be charged to the retained earnings from preceding fiscal years or to the reserve funds, and the balance  shall  be  booked  into  a  special  'carry  forward' account'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financi\u00e8re L'Arcouest does not intend to request a seat on the board for itself or any other person.'\n\n- \u00b7 Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers  declared  that  on 29  December 2023 she had individually  descended  below the  lower  legal  thresholds  of  5%  of  the  capital  and  the voting rights of L'Or\u00e9al (AMF declaration no. 224C0007).\n\nFor  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  it  is  specified  that  within  the framework  of  this  contribution  of  assets,  the  Bettencourt Meyers family did not cross any legal threshold within L'Or\u00e9al. The  breakdown  of  share  capital  at  31  December  2023  is detailed in subsection 7.3.2.\n\nThe Company is authorised to trade in its own shares on or off the  Stock  Exchange  in  accordance  with  Articles  L.  22-10-62 et  seq.  and  L.  225-210  to  L.  225-217  of  the  French Commercial Code, within the limits and in accordance with the purposes  defined  by  the  authorisations  granted  to  it  by  the Annual General Meeting.",

They do not include any preferential rights for sales or  acquisitions  for  the  benefit  of  the  signatories  and  do  not constitute a concerted action vis-\u00e0-vis the Company.\n\nOn friday  29  December  2023,  the  agreements  concluded  in 2016  were  terminated  and  a  new  lock-up  agreement  was concluded  pursuant  to  Article  787  B  of  the  French  General Tax  Code,  representing  the  same  number  of  L'Or\u00e9al  shares and  similar  to  those  concluded  in  2016,  with  the  addition  of the company  Financi\u00e8re  L'Arcouest  (controlled  by  Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers and her family) as a signatory.\n\n## Commitments of the Bettencourt Meyers family associated with their waiver granted in 2021 by the AMF from the obligation to file a draft public offer for the L'Or\u00e9al shares (1)\n\nFollowing  the  2021  repurchase  by  L'Or\u00e9al  of  4%  of  its  own shares  held  by  Nestl\u00e9,  and  the  consequent  cancellation\n\nin February 2022 of the 22,260,000 shares thus repurchased by  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family  exceeded  the thresholds  of  one  third  of  the  Company's  share  capital and voting rights. The AMF granted the Bettencourt Meyers family a waiver from the obligation to file a draft public offer for  the  L'Or\u00e9al  shares.  Accordingly,  the  Bettencourt  Meyers family has undertaken (2) , for a period expiring at the end of the Annual General Meeting of L'Or\u00e9al called in 2025 to approve the  financial  statements  for  the  financial  year  ending 31 December 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 not to acquire shares in L'Or\u00e9al beyond those they held on the date of the AMF's waiver decision;\n- \u00b7 to  refrain  from  participating  in  decisions  of  L'Or\u00e9al's governance  bodies  that  could  lead  to  a  passive  increase in the capital and voting rights of L'Or\u00e9al; and\n- \u00b7 to refrain from exercising the proportion of its voting rights in excess of 33.33% of the voting rights of L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nWithin  the  context  of  the  transfer  by  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt  Meyers  of  27,650,000  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  to  the company  Financi\u00e8re  L'Arcouest,  on  12  December  2023,  the AMF  granted  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family  a  waiver  from the obligation to file a draft public offer for the L'Or\u00e9al shares (AMF  decision no. 223C2036)  following this internal reclassification  within  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family  group. As  a  member  joining  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family  group, Financi\u00e8re L'Arcouest is therefore required to comply with the aforementioned  commitments  made  by  the  Bettencourt Meyers  family  group  as  part  of  the  waiver  decision  of  8 December 2021.\n\nThe  Company  is  not  aware  of  any  shareholders'  agreements affecting shares and its capital other than those described above.\n\n## 7.3.6. Buyback and cancellation by the Company of its own shares\n\nDuring  the  2023  financial  year,  the  Company  redeemed  1,271,632  of  its  own  shares,  in  accordance  with  the  authorisation approved by the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2023.\n\nThe table below summarises by purpose the transactions carried out in this context and the use made of the securities redeemed:\n\n| Date of authorisation of the Annual General Meeting      | 13 th  resolution of 21 April 2023                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Authorisation expiry date                                | 20 October 2024                                                                                                     |\n| Maximum amount of authorised buybacks                    | 10% of the share capital on the date of the buybacks (i.e. as an indication, 53,518,656 shares at 31 December 2022) |\n| Maximum purchase price per share (excluding costs)       | \u20ac600                                                                                                                |\n| Authorised purposes                                      | Cancellation Employee shareholding Free grants of shares Liquidity and market stabilisation                         |\n| Board of Directors' meeting that decided on the buybacks | External growth, merger, demerger or contribution 27 July 2023                                                      |\n| Purpose of buybacks                                      | Cancellation                                                                                                        |\n| Period of buybacks made                                  | From 6 September 2023 to 30 November 2023                                                                           |\n| Number of shares bought back                             | 1,271,632                                                                                                           |\n| Average purchase price per share                         | \u20ac393.20*                                                                                                            |\n| Use of shares bought back                                | Cancellation                                                                                                        |\n\n- * Excluding expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Long-term incentive plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7.4.1. Presentation of the stock option Plans for the purchase or subscription of shares and Plans for Conditional Grants of Shares to employees (ACAs)\n\n## Policy\n\nFor several years, L'Or\u00e9al has set up long-term incentive plans in  favour  of  its  employees  and  corporate  officers  in  an international  context,  in  the  form  of  grants  of  performance shares.\n\nThese grants serve a dual purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 motivate and reward those who make significant contributions  to  future  increases  in  the  Group's  financial and non-financial results; and\n- \u00b7 strengthen  involvement  and  the  sense  of  belonging  of  its beneficiaries by fostering long-term loyalty in a context of increased competition for talent.\n\nSince  the  2022  ACAs  Plan,  performance  conditions  have included  the  non-financial  criteria  described  below.  These criteria serve  L'Or\u00e9al's  dual  goal:  economic  and  social excellence to create sustainable value for all.\n\n## History\n\nUntil  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  exclusively  granted stock subscription or purchase options to the senior managers and  corporate  officers  whom  L'Or\u00e9al  wished  to  reward  for their  performance  and  their  important  role,  wherever  they might be geographically located.\n\nIn  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  enlarged  its  policy  by introducing an ACAs vehicle.\n\nThe objective was:\n\n- \u00b7 to provide a long-term incentive offering greater motivation  to  all  those  who  received  stock  options  only occasionally or in limited numbers; and\n- \u00b7 to reach  out  to  a  broader  population  of  potential beneficiaries,  particularly  internationally,  in  a  context  of increased competition for talents.\n\nThe  Company  would  be  able  to  buy  its  own  shares  for  the following purposes:\n\n- \u00b7 cancelling them;\n- \u00b7 selling them within the scope of employee share ownership programmes and allocating them to free grants of shares for  the  benefit  of  employees  and  directors  and  corporate officers of the Group;\n- \u00b7 market-making under a liquidity agreement; and\n- \u00b7 retaining  the  shares  and  subsequently  using  them  as payment  in  connection  with  external  growth,  merger, demerger or contribution transactions.\n\nThe  authorisation  would  concern  up  to  10%  of  the  share capital,  i.e., as  an  indication,  53,472,547  shares  for  a maximum amount of \u20ac37,430,783,250 at 31 December 2023; it being specified that the Company may not at any time hold more than 10% of its own share capital.\n\nThe purchase, sale, exchange or transfer of these shares may be carried out by any means on one or more occasions, on or off the stock market, including in whole or in part, through the acquisition,  sale,  exchange  or  transfer  of  blocks  of  shares. These means include the use of all financial instruments and derivatives (see Resolution 17).",

        "page_content": "In  2011,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  make  ACAs the main vehicle for its long-term incentive policy by extending the grant of shares to the main senior managers of the Group who until then only had received stock options. In 2012, at the suggestion  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors went one step further in this policy and decided to replace the grant of stock options with conditional grants of shares for all beneficiaries as of the 2013 Plan.\n\n## Grant process\n\nThe plans are proposed by General Management to the Board of  Directors  which  decides,  after  receiving  the  opinion  of  the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, the principle of these plans and the applicable conditions and rules.\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendation, these  grants  are  made  over  the  same  period  each  year: between 2009 and 2019 they were put in place following the approval  of  the  financial  accounts  for  the  previous  financial year  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  and  since  2020  they have been put in place at the end of the year, being specified that the first year the performance conditions are assessed is the financial year following the year of grant.\n\nThe decision with regard to each individual grant is, in every case,  contingent  upon  the  quality  of  the  performance rendered  at  the  time  of  implementation  of  the  plan  with particular  attention  being  paid  to  the  main  talents  for  the\n\n## Share capital and stock market information\n\nLong-term incentive plans\n\nfuture. According to the eligibility criteria linked to the position held  by  the  beneficiary  and  the  size  of  the  entity  or  the country  in  which  the  beneficiary  works,  to  ensure  worldwide fairness,  these  grants  are  made  every  year,  on  a  recurring basis every two to three years, or more regularly.\n\nThe  General  Management  and  the  Board  of  Directors reiterate the importance that is given to bringing together the interests  of  the  beneficiaries  of  conditional  grants  of  shares and those of the shareholders themselves.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  (senior  managers  and  corporate  officers) share with the shareholders the same confidence in the strong steady growth of the Company with a medium and long-term vision.\n\nThe  attention  of  the  beneficiaries  of  conditional  grants  of shares is drawn to the regulations in force concerning persons holding  'inside  information'.  The  beneficiaries  of  conditional grants  of  shares  undertake  to  read  L'Or\u00e9al's  Stock  Market Code of Ethics, included in the beneficiary's grant file.\n\n## Number of beneficiaries\n\n54%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  12  October  2023  Plan  are women.  Nearly  3,600  employees,  representing  8%  of  the managers  around  the  world,  nearly  54%  of  whom  are  in international  subsidiaries,  benefit  or  have  benefited  from  at least one conditional grant of shares plan since 2019 and were still employees of the Company on 31 December 2023.\n\nVARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF ACAS BENEFICIARIES SINCE 2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7.4.2. Absence of stock option plans for the subscription and purchase of shares of the Company\n\nOn 31 December 2023, there was no stock option plan in place for the purchase of Company shares (1) , the last plan having expired in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Authorisation of the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 21 April 2022\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022 gave the Board of  Directors  the  authorisation  to  carry  out  free  grants  of existing shares and/or shares to be issued to employees and corporate  officers  of  the  Company  and  of  its  French  or foreign subsidiaries under the conditions of Article L. 225-1972 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting set the period of validity of the authorisation, which may be used on one or more occasions, at 26 months.\n\nThe  total  number  of  free  shares  thus  granted  may  not represent  more  than  0.6%  of  the  share  capital  recorded  on the date of the Board of Directors' decision.\n\nThe  number  of  free  shares  granted  to  the  Company's corporate  officers  may  not  represent  more  than  10%  of  the total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  a  financial  year pursuant to this resolution.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  determine  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries  of  the  free  shares  and  the  number  granted  to each of them. It will also determine the conditions to be met in order for the shares to fully vest, in particular the financial and non-financial performance conditions.\n\n## Financial and non-financial performance conditions\n\nThe financial performance criteria are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  like-for-like cosmetics  sales  as compared to those of a panel of its biggest direct competitors (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 variation in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n\nThe non-financial performance criteria are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future program (% of sites achieving 100% renewable energy, formerly known as 'carbon neutral' (2) ; % of formula ingredients  that  are  biobased,  traceable  and  come  from sustainable  sources;  %  of  plastic  packaging  that  comes from either recycled or biobased sources; number of people benefiting  from  the  Group's  brands'  social  commitment programs); and\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  strategic  positions  including  the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors indeed considers that these two types of criteria, assessed over a long period of three financial years and applied to several plans, are complementary, in line with the  Group's  objectives  and  its  specificities  and  likely  to promote  balanced,  continuing  growth  over  the  long  term. They  are  challenging  but  remain  a  source  of  motivation  for the beneficiaries. The  grant  of  such  shares  to  their beneficiaries, for all or part of the shares granted, will become final provided that the other conditions set at the time of grant are met, at the end of a minimum vesting period of four years.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to net sales ,  in  order for all the free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al must outperform the average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors. Below this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit ,  in  order for  all  the  free  shares  granted  to  be  fully  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  level  of growth defined by the Board of Directors, but not made public for  confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  achieved  or  exceeded. Below this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  If  the  operating  profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant  to  the criterion  related  to  the  achievement  of  the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments ,  in order for all the free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end  of  the  vesting  period,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future Commitments have to be met at a certain level, as defined  by the Board of Directors and made public, on average over the course  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant decreases. No shares will fully vest under this criterion if the average  level  of  achievement  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future Commitments  falls  below  the  minimum  level  defined  by  the Board of Directors and made public.\n\nWith  regard  to  the criterion  of  gender  balance  in  strategic positions ,  including  the  Executive  Committee,  in  order  for  all the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  the  average proportion of employees of each gender in strategic positions must be at least 40%. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares  will  vest  in  relation  to  this  criterion  if  the  average representation  of  one  of  the  genders  is  less  than  35%  over  the vesting period.\n\nThese  performance  conditions  will  apply,  for  all  individual grants  greater  than  100  free  shares  per  plan,  to  all  shares above  the  hundredth  share,  with  the  exception  of  grants  to the  corporate  officers  and  members  of  the  Executive Committee, for which they will apply in total. The free grant of shares  may  be  carried  out  for  all  Group  employees  without performance conditions, or for shares allocated on the basis of  cash  subscriptions  carried  out  as  part  of  an  increase in share capital reserved for Group employees.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  be  able  to  settle  vesting  and holding  periods  which  are  longer  than  the  minimum  periods set above. This mechanism for the conditional grant of shares complies with the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nAny  allocations  of  shares  to  the  corporate  officers  will  be decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  basis  of  the proposals  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  after  assessment  of  their  performance.  The corporate officers of L'Or\u00e9al will be required to hold 50% of their fully vested shares in registered form until they cease to hold office.",

Conditional Grants of Shares granted within the framework of the authorisation of 21 April 2022 (ACAs Plan of 12 October 2023)\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  proposals  made  by  the  General Management  and  examined  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided, at  its  meeting  on  12  October  2023,  to  make  a  Conditional Grant of Shares within the scope of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2022.\n\nThe share capital at 12 October 2023 comprised 535,997,107 shares, and 3,215,982 shares could therefore be issued.\n\nThe Board of Directors used this authorisation at its meeting of 12 October  2023  by  granting  650,580  shares  to 2,763 beneficiaries. This is a free grant of shares to be issued.\n\nVesting of the shares is subject to a dual condition:\n\n- \u00b7 presence: the shares granted will only vest after a period of four years at the end of which the beneficiary must still be an employee of the Group (except in the cases provided by the law or the Plan rules); and\n- \u00b7 performance, evaluated as follows:\n\nFinancial criteria represent 80%  of  the  performance conditions, split evenly between:\n\n- \u00b7 the  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  like-for-like  cosmetics  sales  as compared  to  those  of  a  panel  of  its  biggest  direct competitors (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 the variation in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit.\n\nNon-financial criteria represent 20%  of performance conditions and are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 for 15%,  the  fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social responsibility commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future program  (%  of  sites  achieving 100%  renewable  energy,  formerly  known  as  'carbon neutral' (2) ; %  of  formula  ingredients  that  are  biobased, traceable and come from sustainable sources; % of plastic packaging  that  comes  from  either  recycled  or  biobased sources;  number  of  people  benefiting  from  the  Group's brands' social commitment programs); and\n- \u00b7 for  5%,  the  gender  balance  within  strategic  positions including the Executive Committee.\n\nThe  calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  arithmetic average of the performances for financial years 2024, 2025 and 2026.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to net sales ,  in order for all the free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  L'Or\u00e9al  must  outperform the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors. Below this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in net sales\n\nLong-term incentive plans\n\nof the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this  criterion.  The  Board  of  Directors  defines  a threshold,  not  made public for  confidentiality  reasons,  below which no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit ,  in order for  all  the  free  shares  granted  to  be  fully  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  level  of growth defined by the Board of Directors, but not made public for  confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  met  or  exceeded.  Below this level, the grant decreases. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion  related  to  the  achievement  of  the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments, in order for all the free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, an average of 70% of the L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future  Commitments  must  be  achieved  during  the vesting  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  If  the average level  of  achievement  for  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future Commitments  falls  below  55%,  no  shares  will  finally  vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant  to  the  criterion  related  to  gender  balance in strategic positions ,  in  order for all the free shares granted to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of the vesting period, the average representation of one of the genders  must  account  for  at  least  40%  of  employees in  strategic  positions.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases. If  the  average  representation  of  one  of  the  genders  is  less than 35% over the vesting period, no shares will finally vest in relation to this criterion.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee  is responsible  for  communicating  to  the  Board  of  Directors the  level  of  indicators  recorded  for  the  years  to  be  used  for the  calculation  of  the  performance  conditions.  The  Board of  Directors  records,  at  the  appropriate  time,  the  level of  performance  achieved  on  which  the  number  of  shares that finally vests depends.\n\nThe  figures  recorded  each  year  to  determine  the  levels  of performance achieved are published in paragraph 7.4.3.6.\n\nThe vesting of the first 100 conditional grants of shares is not subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions except for beneficiaries who were members of the Executive Committee at grant date, including the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 7.4.3.3.

Ordinary part\n\n## Resolutions 1, 2 and 3: Approval of the annual (parent company and consolidated) financial statements for 2023, allocating the company's net income and setting the dividend\n\n## EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nHaving reviewed the Reports of the Board of Directors and the Statutory Auditors, the Annual General Meeting is called on to approve:\n\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements for 2023, with an income statement showing net income of \u20ac3,826,295,624.92 in 2023, compared with \u20ac12,343,116,730.68 for 2022; and\n- \u00b7 the 2023 consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe details of these financial statements are set out in the 2023 Annual Financial Report and the main data included in the  package  containing  the  notice  convening  the  Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  proposes  to  the  Annual  General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7 an ordinary dividend of \u20ac6.60 per share, representing an increase  of  10%  over  the  dividend  for  the  previous financial year.\n\nThe rate of distribution of the ordinary dividend (ordinary dividend  paid/net  income  diluted  per  share  excluding non-recurring  items,  attributable  to  owners  of  the Company) would be 54.64% in 2023. Over the last five financial years, this rate was:\n\n| Year                  | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of  distribution | 54.4%  | 49.7%  | 54.8%  | 54.4%  | 53.3%  |\n\n## First resolution: approval of the 2023 parent company financial statements\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Reports  of  the  Board  of Directors and the Statutory Auditors, approves the Report of the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  financial  year  2023  parent company  financial  statements,  as  presented,  and  the transactions reported in these financial statements  and summarised in these Reports, showing net income of \u20ac3,826,295,624.92 versus \u20ac12,343,116,730.68 for financial year 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 a preferential  dividend of  \u20ac7.26  per  share,  corresponding to a 10% increase over the ordinary dividend.\n\nThe  preferential  dividend  will  be  granted  to  the  shares held  in  registered  form  since  31  December  2021  at  the latest, and which continuously remain in registered form until the dividend payment date in 2024. The number of shares  eligible  for  this  preferential  dividend  may  not exceed,  for  the  same  shareholder,  0.5%  of  the  share capital.\n\nIf  the  Annual  General  Meeting  approves this proposal, the ex-dividend  date  for  the  dividends  (both  ordinary  and preferential) will be 26 April 2024 at zero hour, Paris time, and they will be paid on 30 April 2024.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  ordinary  dividend  and  the  preferential dividend  is  eligible  for  the  tax  deduction  provided  for  in Article  158.3.  2\u00b0  of  the  French  General  Tax  Code,  which  is applicable in the event that an individual beneficiary opts to tax  his  or  her  income  from  movable  assets  on  the progressive scale of income tax.\n\n## Second resolution: approval of the 2023 consolidated financial statements\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Reports  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  Statutory  Auditors,  approves  the  financial year 2023  consolidated  financial statements  and  the transactions  included  in  these  financial  statements  and summarised in these Reports.\n\n## Third resolution: allocation of the Company's net income for financial year 2023 and setting of the dividend\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, on the proposal of the Board of Directors, decides to  allocate  the  net  income  for  the  2023  financial  year, amounting to \u20ac3,826,295,624.92  as follows:\n\nNo charge to the legal reserve which already represents over one-tenth of the share capital\n\n-\n\nAmount allocated to shareholders as dividend (1) (including preferential dividend)\n\n\u20ac3,564,018,999.42\n\nBalance that will be allocated to the 'Other reserves' item\n\n\u20ac262,276,625.50\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their term of office will end on expiry of their term of office as the statutory auditors appointed to certify the financial statements, i.e. at the end of the Annual Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending on 31 December 2027.\n\n## Ninth resolution: appointment of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s as Statutory Auditor for the certification of sustainability reporting\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the Report of the Board of  Directors,  resolves  to  appoint  Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  as Statutory Auditor for the certification of sustainability reporting for  a  period  of  four  financial  years,  which  corresponds  to  the remainder of their term of office as Statutory Auditor for the certification of the financial statements. Its term will expire at the  end  of  the  Annual  Ordinary  General  Meeting  called  to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending on 31 December 2027.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  has  considered  the  need  to  ensure that sustainability data is robustly monitored by international  audit  firms,  working  as  joint  auditors,  that demonstrate the required level of independence and taking into  account  the  expertise  of  their  teams  in  both  finance and  sustainability  matters.  The  Committee  has  also  taken into  account  the  importance  of  their  sound  understanding of  L'Or\u00e9al's  business  and  its  sustainability  challenges,  in order  to  be  able  to  audit  the  Group's  consolidated  data from financial year 2024 onwards.\n\n## Tenth resolution: appointment of Ernst & Young Audit as Statutory Auditor for the certification of sustainability reporting\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  in  accordance  with  the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the Report of the Board of  Directors,  resolves  to  appoint  Ernst  &  Young  Audit  as Statutory  Auditor  for  the  certification  of  sustainability reporting  for  a  period  of  four  financial  years,  which corresponds  to  the  remainder  of  their  term  of  office  as Statutory  Auditor  for  the  certification  of  the  financial statements.  Its  term  will  expire  at  the  end  of  the  Annual Ordinary  General  Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial statements for the financial year ending on 31 December 2027.\n\n## Resolutions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16: Remuneration of directors and corporate officers of the Company\n\n## EXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  is  called  to  approve  the remunerations  of  the  Company's  directors  and  corporate officers for 2023 ( ex post vote).\n\nThe Annual General Meeting must vote every year on the remuneration  granted  or  paid  during  the  financial  year ended to directors and corporate officers of the Company.\n\nThis ex-post vote covers  two  series  of  resolutions:  one concerning  all  directors  and  corporate  officers,  i.e.,  for L'Or\u00e9al,  the  Directors,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer;  and  the  other concerning only the corporate officers of the Company, i.e., for  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors, Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus.\n\nTherefore, the shareholders are called, by the vote on the eleventh  resolution , to  approve  the  information  on  the remuneration  of  each  of  the  Company's  aforementioned directors  and  corporate  officers  for  2023  as  required by Article L. 22-10-9, I of the French Commercial Code.

These  policies  shall  apply as  from  financial  year  2024  until  the  Annual  General Meeting approves a new remuneration policy.\n\nThe provisions of these remuneration policies introduced by the Board of Directors are set out in paragraph 2.4.1. of the 2023  Universal  Registration  Document.  Shareholders  are called to approve separately:\n\n- \u00b7 by the vote on the fourteenth resolution, the remuneration  policy  for  Directors  of  the  Company introduced  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  This  policy  is identical to the remuneration  policy  for  Directors approved at the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2023 and is set out in paragraph 2.4.1.1. of the 2023 Universal Registration Document;\n- \u00b7 by the vote on the fifteenth resolution, the remuneration policy  for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors presented  in  the  Report  of  the  Board  of  Directors. Changes have been made to this policy compared to the remuneration  policy  for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors approved at the Annual General Meeting of 21 April  2023.  Three  years  after  the  offices  of  Chairman\n\nand  Chief  Executive  Officer  were  separated,  the  Board noted that Mr Jean-Paul Agon had successfully led the handover  of  senior  management  responsibilities,  which included  providing  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  with  his complete  support  in  his  interactions  with  the  Board  of Directors, in keeping with the extensive duties entrusted to  the  Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee recommended that the Board consider the end of this transition period by  adjusting  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  remuneration.  In consequence, the Board of Directors held on 8 February 2024  review  the  remuneration  policy  of  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  fixed annual  compensation  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors,  would  be  \u20ac950,000  from 1  May  2024,  instead  of  his  previous  compensation  of \u20ac1,600,000.  The  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chairman of the Board of Directors is set out in subparagraph 2.4.1.2.2. of the 2023 Universal Registration Document;\n\n- \u00b7 by the vote on the sixteenth resolution, the remuneration policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  This  policy  is identical  to  the  remuneration  policy  approved  at  the Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2023,  with  the exception of an adjustment to non-financial performance criteria for awarding performance shares. The remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer is set out  in  subparagraph  2.4.1.2.1.  of  the  2023  Universal Registration Document.\n\nSUMMARY TABLE OF THE COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION PAID IN 2023 OR ALLOCATED FOR THAT FINANCIAL YEAR TO MR JEAN-PAUL AGON, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n| Remuneration  components  submitted  for a vote   | Amounts allocated for  the 2023 financial year  or accounting valuation   | Amounts paid  in 2023 or  accounting  valuation   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed  remuneration                               | \u20ac1,600,000                                                                |                                                   | At its meeting of 9 February 2023, on the recommendation of the Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors  kept  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  fixed  compensation  at  the gross amount of \u20ac1,600,000 on an annual basis.                                                             |\n| Benefits in  addition  to remuneration            | \u20ac0                                                                        |                                                   | Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  benefits  from  the  material  resources needed for the performance of his office such as, for example, the provision of a car with a driver.

The number of vested shares will depend:\n\n- \u00b7 in part, criteria for financial performance based on:\n- \u00b7 growth in comparable cosmetics sales of L'Or\u00e9al as compared to a panel of L'Or\u00e9al's major direct competitors,\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n- \u00b7 in part, criteria for non-financial performance based on:\n- \u00b7 fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility  commitments made by the Group as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme (hereinafter  'L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  Commitments'):  %  of  sites achieving 100% renewable energy (previously designated as 'carbon neutral') (1) ; % of formula ingredients that are biobased, traceable and come  from  sustainable  sources;  %  of  plastic  packaging  that  comes from either recycled or biobased sources; number of people benefitting from the Group's brands' social commitment programmes, and\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  strategic  positions  including  the  Executive Committee.\n\nPursuant  to  the  criterion  relating  to  net  sales, in  order  for  all  the  free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al must outperform the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors. Below this level, the number of finally vested shares  is  in  decline.  If  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  growth  in  net  sales  is  lower than  the  average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors,  no shares will be finally vested under this criterion.\n\nPursuant  to  the  criterion  related  to  operating  profit, a  level  of  growth, defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons, must be met or exceeded in order for all free shares granted to be finally vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this level,  the  number  of  finally  vested  shares  is  in  decline.  If  the  operating profit  does  not  increase  in  absolute  value  over  the  period,  no  share  will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  achievement  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future Commitments criterion, in order for all the free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, an average of 70% of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments must be achieved during the  vesting  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  No  shares  will vest  if  the  average  level  of  achievement  for  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future Commitments falls below 55%.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to gender balance in strategic positions, in  order  for  all  the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, the average representation of  one  of  the  sexes  must  account  for  at  least  40%  of  employees in strategic positions. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThe grant of shares to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus in 2023 represents 2.61% of the total number of ACAs granted to the 2,763 beneficiaries of this same Plan. In accordance with the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022, this grant of shares does not represent more than 0.6% of  the  share  capital,  it  being  understood  that  the  maximum  amount granted  to  corporate  officers  may  not  represent  more  than  10%  of  the total amount of free shares that may be granted. No share subscription or purchase  options  or  other  long-term  incentives  have  been  granted  to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus in 2023.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus does not receive any remuneration as Director.",

The  Board  of  Directors  shall  have  the  power,  in  all cases, to provide for vesting periods which are longer than the minimum periods set above or to provide for a holding period.\n\nIf the Annual General Meeting approves this resolution, any free  grant  of  shares  shall  be  decided  by  the  Board  of Directors on the basis of the proposals made by the General Management and examined by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  decide  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries of the grants, the number of shares allocated to  each  one  and  the  performance  conditions  to  be  met for the final vesting of all or part of the shares.\n\nSince the plan of 13 October 2022, the Board of Directors, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee, decided to introduce criteria for non-financial performance in addition to financial performance  within  the  long-term  remuneration  plan,  in order  to  correlate  them  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  in  which economic  performance  and  environmental  and  social performance go hand-in-hand.\n\nThese performance conditions take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 in part, financial performance criteria on the basis of the following reported figures:\n- \u00b7 growth  in  comparable  cosmetics  sales  of  L'Or\u00e9al  as compared  to  a  panel  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  major  direct competitors, and\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n- \u00b7 in  part, non-financial  performance  criteria on  the  basis of:\n- \u00b7 fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments  made  by  the  Group  as  part  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (%  of  renewable energy  achieved  by  the  Group's  operated  sites;  %  of plastic  packaging  that  comes  from  either  recycled  or biobased sources; number of people benefitting from the Group's brands' social commitment programmes, hereinafter 'L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments'), and\n- \u00b7 gender balance within  management bodies (strategic positions including the Executive Committee, hereinafter the Management Bodies).\n\nThe figures  recorded  each  year  to  determine  the  levels  of performance achieved are published in the Annual Financial Report included in the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that both of these types of criteria, assessed over a long period of three full financial years, are complementary,  in  line  with  the  Group's objectives and its specificities,  and  should  make  it  possible to  promote  balanced,  continuing  and  sustainable  growth over the long term. They are exacting but remain a source of motivation for the beneficiaries.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to net sales ,  in  order  for all free shares  granted  to  be  fully  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  L'Or\u00e9al's\n\ncomparable  growth  in  net  sales  must  outperform  the average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors. This  panel  comprises  Unilever,  Procter  &  Gamble,  Est\u00e9e Lauder,  Shiseido,  Beiersdorf,  Kenvue,  Henkel,  LVMH,  Kao and Coty. Below this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable  growth  in  net  sales  is  less  than  the  average growth in sales of the panel of competitors, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit , a level of  growth,  defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  met  or  exceeded  in  order for  all  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this level, the number of finally vested shares is in decline. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nWith regard to the criterion of fulfilling commitments made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme ,  in  order  for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  certain average level of achievement of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments, defined by the Board and made public, must be  reached  over  the  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant decreases. No shares will vest if the average of the results for the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments falls below the minimum level defined by the Board and made public.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to gender balance within Management Bodies , in order for all the free shares granted to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the vesting  period,  the  average  representation  of  one  of  the sexes must account for at least 40% of employees on the Management Bodies. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThese  performance  conditions  will  apply,  for  all  individual grants greater than 100 free shares per plan, to all shares above the hundredth share, with the exception of grants to the  directors  and  corporate  officers  and  members  of  the Executive Committee, for which they will apply in total.\n\nThe free grant of shares may be carried out for all Group staff without  performance  conditions,  or  for  shares allocated on the basis of cash subscriptions carried out as part  of  a  share  capital  increase  reserved  for  Group employees  pursuant  to  the  twentieth  and  twenty-first resolutions  put  before  this  Annual  General  Meeting  or,  if applicable,  pursuant  to  any  similar  resolutions  that  may supersede those resolutions during the period of validity of this delegation.\n\nAny  allocations  of  shares  to  the  directors  and  corporate officers  will  be  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the basis  of  the  proposals  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee  after  assessment  of  their performance.\n\nThe  corporate  officers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  will  be  required  to  hold 50% of their fully vested shares in registered form until they cease to hold office.",
